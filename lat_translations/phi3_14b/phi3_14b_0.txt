Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed this for you, my son, the book which is the last in medical knowledge with its complement, and reaching the end within it from those expositions and declarations themselves, I wished to complete it for you along with this Treatise that is a part of surgery - namely, operative chirurgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since the art of manual surgery was abandoned in our region and time altogether, until perhaps the knowledge itself has vanished and its trace is gone: only small descriptions remain from it among ancient books, which hands have modified: to them errors occurred and hesitations until their intentions were closed off, and extended their own will: I saw that I should vivify it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to positions, declarations, and abbreviations, and so that I would come with forms of instruments for Cautery and other operative tools: coming from additions to its declarations and necessary adaptation.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 However, because a good artisan of it with his hand is not found in this time, as the art of medicine is long and requires an author to exercise it before that knowledge in anatomy which Galen narrated - until he knows injuries of members, their forms, and connection and separation among them, and has knowledge of bones, nerves, muscles, numbering of those, their exit and arrival, pulsatile ones and calmness, and the locations of their exits.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for that reason Hippocrcuas said: a name with its own name is much, and little with the work, especially in manual art.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 However, we have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Since who is not aware of what we have spoken about anatomy cannot be purged unless it already falls into error from which people perish: as I saw many formed from this science and boasting themselves without knowledge or experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 What it is that I saw a stupid doctor cut an abscess of the groin of a woman and accidentally severed some arterangs in her neck, so that the blood flowed from the woman until she fell dead between his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I saw another doctor who intended to remove a stone from the testicle of an older man, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he approached him and removed it with a bladder pouch.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I had already been called to remove it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I saw another physcian who received payment from someone among our Duke's servants because of the medicine: and it happened to an eunuch, who was black, near him, that he had a fracture in his thigh close to the calcaneum: and the doctor hurried due to his ignorance, and pressed the fracture over the wound with filth, and with strong bands, and did not allow the bleeding of the wound.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he released him according to his own desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Later he dismissed him after several days and instructed him not to loosen the bandage: and it stayed thus until a tumor formed on his leg, and his foot, and came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 Therefore I was called to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and peace ensued, and he was relieved from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 However, the corruption had already become confirmed in the limb: and I could not contain it anymore.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Therefore the corruption ceased to walk on the limb until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physcian who pierced through the cancerous tumor: and it was ulcerated after days, until its wickedness grew greatly with its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Which is because when it is a pure cancer from the black bile, then one should not come near it at all with iron unless it is in a body that can bear it, so as to be entirely severed from its own matter.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of this, my son, it is necessary for you to know that the surgery with hands is divided into two divisions: namely, the division associated with health and the division where there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have now awakened in every place of this book, where comes the operation to be performed, which brings about fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Why is it necessary for you to be careful with that, and limit it: so that fools do not find an opportunity to speak and defame.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Therefore, take the measure with diligence and protection, help your sick ones easily and firmly, and pray for a better way to lead you by the grace of God to health and praisewein succession: cast away terrible pains difficult to heal, and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it remains more for your glory, and higher on this earth, and finally to the measures of yours.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 For indeed Gallon said that in some of his reminders.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 One does not cure the evil sickness: do not call me doctor of illnesses.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, this Treatise has been divided into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	 Chapter the first.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 Of the Cautery with Fire and of the Acute Medicinal Cautery, chapter, and arranged from head to feet, and forms of instruments and tools for Cauterization, and all that is necessary for the Operation.
Capitulum secundum.	 Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 Of the Section and Perforation, Phlebotomy and Ventilation, Wounds: and Extraction of Arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter, ordered by forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 Of the Restoration and Dislocation, Cure of Torsion, and similar things: chapter, ordered from head to feet, by forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God Alone The Glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 Book of the Surgical Knowledge of Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On Wounding and Injury by Burning: which constitutions it is suitable for, and when it should be applied, either with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 However, before recounting the method of this operation and its injuries, it must be stated about their quality, and how they should be shown regarding constitution.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 Therefore, the speech about the quality of Wounding and its injury by Burning is a lengthy, intricate one, with knowledge, and hidden secrets.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Indeed it was discussed among many wise men and they disagreed about that: and for me, it is enough with few words from their speeches, fearing prolixity.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 Therefore, I say that Burning is universally suitable for all constitutions that are with matter and without matter; except for two constitutions which are dry constitution without matter and warm constitution without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 However, they disagree regarding the constitution that is both warm and dry with matter.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some have said, however, that Burning should be used for this.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others have argued the opposite of that, namely that Burning is not suitable for an illness which is due to warmth and dryness: since by nature fire is warmth; and it does not heal with warmth and dryness from a warm and dry condition.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who argues the opposite of that says: that there is an injury with Burning for all warm and dry illnesses which occur in human bodies; because when you compare a human body and its humors to the constitution of fire, you find the body cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And indeed I say through his speech: because he has already proven that for me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 However, it should not come to pass over this, unless he has already been proven and practiced in the final chapter of the Burning operation, and known the diversity of human constitutions, and disposition of illnesses within them, and their causes, and incidents, and timespan.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 However, for the remaining diseases, there is no need to fear them; especially in cold and moist conditions.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For indeed all physicians have agreed on these [remedies]: and they did not differ regarding the use of cautery with them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my sons, that from the secret treatment with cautery and fire, the goodness of it is greater than with burning medicines; for fire is simple, whose action does not extend unless to the member being cauterized: and it harms no other connected member except by a slight injury.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 However, the action of burning remedies reaches that which is extended from the member; and perhaps it causes an illness difficult to heal in a part, and perhaps kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 For fire, due to its subtlenss and the goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 Now this has been revealed to us by experimentation, due to the length of service and study in the art, and proximity to truth: and for that I excuse myself from the length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not because this book of mine does not permit me to bring you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its action in bodies' expulsion by means of a philosophical speech demonstrated to have been remembered by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, my sons, that you yourself disagree on the time when it is suitable to make a cautery, and set a better time with respect to the seasons.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is suitable at any time: therefore, because an accidental injury caused by the season is overwhelmed in healing with the camoion, which is attracted to the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 Especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent aches that do not tolerate delay: therefore because it fears them as coming of a malignity that is greater than a slight injury remaining untreated due to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	 And that notion should not be held in your minds, my son, which is not acknowledged by the wise and learned physicians, namely that there is never a return from those illnesse that are healed through cauterization; and they argue accordingly, but reality is not as they think: therefore because cauterization is only a place in medicine, which alters complexion, and evaporates the humidities which are causes, hence pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 However, the purpose of cauterization is to enhance the health and effectiveness of its treatment, and the severity of its authority: and it may be possible that an illness returns after some time according to the complexion of the sick person, the location of their illness, and the strength of their body; and what has been prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities therein; and what has arrived at it through its acquisition by foods and similar causes, if no disease is present for cauterization.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle disease in the limb due to a few superfluities and moistures, such as gum elastic on the tooth for pain and similar causes, it is indeed possible that this particular pain does not return therein.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens in a few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the speech of the common people again is correct: not what they mean by it in that case: since they believe, that it is a treatment which brings no benefit with medicine, nor any other after dusk from cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 However, the matter is otherwise than that intention, that cauterization being the last of medicine's methods, does not apply when we administer a certain mode of treatment for an illness which those treatments do not confer: then at the end of performing cauterization we provide it, and grants: hence it falls under the category that cauterization is indeed the final step in medicine, not according to the understanding as held by many common people and foolish physicians.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 However, the ancients said that a caustic with gold is better than a caustlete with iron; and they did not say this except for the equality of gold and the sublimity of its substance; and they said that it does not create pus at the site of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 But this is not absolutely so; for I have already tested this, and found that it does not do this on certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And a caustic with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 But indeed when you use fire for a caustic with gold, it is not declared to you whether it burns according to the amount which you wish; because of the redness of the gold: and when it hurries towards cold, and if you add heat over it, it melts into fire, and turns into plates.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Why the craftsman falls from that into preoccupation: and because of this, Caustic with iron is quicker and nearer for us, due to its directness in action.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I have indeed already arranged this Chapter on Caustics according to chapters: and I have arranged those from the head down to the feet, so that seekers may find what they want out of it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 § On the manner of cauterization at the crown's junction.
Caput II.	 Head II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here the cauterization is directed to mastering moisture and cold over the brain: which two causes are of swelling, and an abundance of fluid flows from the head to parts near the eyes and ears, and many dreams, and toothaches, and throat pain: and universally all illnesses that occur due to cold, such as paralysis, swelling, epilepsy, apoplexy, etc., like these diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The mode of cauterization is to advise the sick person: that it be cleansed first with curative medicine purifying the head for three nights or four, as required by the strength of the sick person and his age and habits.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him to make his head bald using needles.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Next, have him sit between your hands in a square position so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the base of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 And therefore when thy middle finger arrivebeth to the spot, mark it with a heating instrument.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then an oil-based cauterizer: which is its form.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then place it over the marked spot and heat it downwards so that your hands are gradually squeezed together, and you remove it slowly.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then quickly move thy hand and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 Which if you see that now a small quantity of skull has already been revealed or a certain amount of grass seed, then gently move your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, repeat thy hand with the same iron or with another of it if it cools down: until you see the bones I told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take some from salt and dissolve it in water, drink the mixture yourself, place it on the spot, and let it be for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place some of the absorbed substance into butter, leave it on the spot until a burn scar is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat that with four-drug ointment until healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 They have said that the more open wound remains, it produces pus; therefore, it is better and promotes healing.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them have said that it should be cauterized to the bone; and keep the oil-based cauterizer until a certain density of bone is burnt.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then scrape after what has been burnt from the bone, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 And others say that it should reach with the cauterizer to the very end until it imprints on the bone, so that the bone falls off as if shaped by a carving tool: or an instrument that women place in infused alphabets: and they think, that from this spot wafts out breath of the head, and let the open sore be abandoned for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated until it consolidates.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 However, to me these two types of cautery are not at all visible except in certain people according to the channel of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And let it be removed; for its own sake, it is better with me.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head indeed is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head sickly is naturally weak: and the first type of cautery, I find it healthier and better, and use it: therefore operating with it for health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Hence, from the manner of cauterizing the head for pain throughout the whole head.
Caput III.	 Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When pain occurs throughout the whole head in a chronic manner: and it is prolonged by those who are sick, and used by physicians, women, purifiers of heads, oils, and emollients. (Note that "empleumatis" seems to be an error or corruption; without context or further information from the original text, providing a correction is challenging.)
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And especially if it has already been cauterized with one type of catury, which we have mentioned, and does not gain anything from those (remedies/practices); then consider the following. (Note that "then consider" is an interpretation; the Latin term may require a more context-specific phrase depending on what follows in the text.)
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 For if the head of a sickly person is strong by nature and not weak, and finds intense coldness: then you should cauterize with another type of cautery underne. (Note that "under" seems to be an incorrect interpretation; without further context from the original text it's unclear what "sub illo parum" means.)
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then you should cauterize it with a cautery over all its own horns of the head, lest the skin be not pierced and a quantity is revealed from within by bone, which we have spoken about. (Note that without context this translation may require adjustments to match specific surgical practices referenced in Albucasis' work.)
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 And you should cauterize it with one type of cautery on its own occipital part of the head, at a place called the wardrobe: and it is a location where one sets their winds; be gentle therein (and do not reveal bone).
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 Indeed, he found himself weakened because of that intense pain, and different from the pain of all other head cauterizations.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I will say this about the Cautery in its place: it is a cautery that should be used to cauterize the skullal horns and the back of the head more delicately with another cautery, which is applied to the middle part of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Thus, on how to perform cauterization for hemorrhages - either with the burning medicine or with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain and swelling occur in the head or it extends up to the eye, and the head is evacuated with cleansing medicines, and further treatment as I have said in divisions of illnesses is administered, but does not resolve everything completely: then cauterization should be performed on that area in two ways: either with burning medicine or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 However, the cautery with burning medicine is to take one of its teeth and remove it along with the core, and split off the extremities from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then, cut out the painful place with a broad fleam until it becomes under the skin at a spot where fat is found.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Therefore, insert it into that under the skin until it is hidden: then bind a suitable constrictor tightly over it with a linen strip, and leave it for fifteen hours; afterward extract it entirely and let blood freely flow out of it for two or three days; afterwards place butter submersed in cotton above it to make the wound produce pus: then heal it by rubbing with ointment until cured.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do this with some burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise, concerning those which burn.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 However, its cauterization with iron is done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The fire of the causticum whose shape is thus.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 And it's called "clay" (also known as cupping): because its form is like that of a clay vessel, which contains something related to burning or charring, and there is a small prominence in the middle of it.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the spot and hold your hand: and slowly move the iron with ease; and let the quantity that is to be burned be equal to the thickness of the skin.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And elevate your hand so as not to burn the underlying artery and let blood flow occur.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then soak the cauterium in salted water and place it on the spot for three days; then put a cauterium with butter: afterward, heal it with ointment until it is completely healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, treat this hemicrany using the second sharp edge of the cauterium tool.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 And avoid making an incision on the artery for this hemiccuhy.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 In such a manner of treating hemicraies with old methods.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When treating a hemicrany with what we have mentioned in the previous treatment and what we have mentioned about disease divisions, and if there is no immediate healing: and you see from the illness that what has been said before regarding first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire does not suffice for it; then let the burns be made with the blade of a scalpel till pus forms after having placed signs of pain on the spot in lines whose length is half a finger long, or almost that: and hold your hand over one place until you make an incision into the artery and come near to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 However, it is necessary for you to cauterize the continuation of the jawbone that moves during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve which moves it, from where a spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And this is done over the foreskin, and precautions regarding the flow of blood from the severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 However, the fear is about that incision, especially for him who does not know what he does and is neither diligent nor experienced: and abandons the surgery with him firstly.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I come with a recollection of the management of blood flow accidents from an artery according to its nature, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 But if you see from the illness that this Cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick man enduring the Cajoile on his head, as we have described, treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you see, apply the Cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter of extracting an artery with a Cajoile having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 For this kind of Cautery is better and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 On the method of applying a Cajoile for an earache.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When an earache happens from the cold and is healed with poultices and the remaining treatment as we have mentioned in division, and if it does not remove pain then use a fire Cajoile; and this is called the Point which has this form: [Image of Punctum] (Note that this text implies an image should follow. As this could be historical or archaeological representation of the technique, here we represent it with "[Image of Punctum]" for completeness in translation).
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then after its use of the Point around the entire ear as it moves: or around both ears if there is pain in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And stretch with the Cajoile from the root of the ear just enough after you have marked places with Encausto (beeswax): and the quantity of the Point should be ten throughout the entire ear, as above.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then care for the spots until they heal.

Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 When healing this type of torture with hot baths, purgatives, and gargles does not provide your cure, then it is necessary that you cauterize the sick person three times: one at the root of the ear, a second lower but near to its tympanum, and a third at the junction of both lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 And place your caster on the opposite side of the weak area.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 For soothing does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the form of cauterization is to apply it with your caster on the skin directly under the upper end of the ear, slightly below a bit; and another at its tympanum: whose length shall be according to the width of the finger.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the caster until it burns off half the thickness of the skin.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the caster and it is a kind from a knife, whose shape has been given beforehand; however, it is not so fine as you can see: and it should be that there is excess thickness little in the knife.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then care for the places with what has preceded; until it heals.

When ancient apoplexy is being treated, and the methods we have mentioned do not provide your healing, and the sick person does not have a fever, then you should cauterize him with four casters over all corners of his head, and with a caster in the middle as we have said, and a caster on the occipital part, just like what has preceded; and the form of the caster will be according to that which preceded.

In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 For the burner with fire, instruct the patient to remove their hairs beforehand if they are among those who cleanse them; until they grow out and become even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If they prick him near his own origin: then tighten their eyes with wet cloths so that they do not move until they heal.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they have healed and become even, then place the patient's head in your lap; next mark over the eyelids of their eyes with encaustic paint, a mark that corresponds to the shape of myrtle leaves: and let the beginning of the mark be near their hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a soaked cotyledon on parchment paper or mucilage of Psyllium over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then with the burner fire, whose shape is as follows. (Note: The description of the burner's shape would be expected to follow in a full translation
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then burn over the shape you marked gradually in many places until the skin surface is charred, which is like the entire visible face of a myrtle leaf.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the sign of the success of your work is: if you see that the eyelid of the eye has started to contract, and hairs grow at the point near the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Therefore cleanse your hand and then release it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a piece of cotton soaked in oil on the wound until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 And if a few hairs emerge after the hour, and soothe the eyelid; then repeat the cautery on that spot as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 But if hairs are on the lower part: then burn that area with cautery until it returns to its natural place; and smooth so as not to prickle the eyes with hairs.

Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 You are instructed to advise the patient that he should let hairs grow out and become even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	 Make a leaf-like shape from linen cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	 Then take a piece from known soap and one unweighed ounce of not soaked lime, then mix them with good pressure at once, that it does not become cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then spread out the resulting paste on a cloth made like the leaf shape you created earlier, and place it over one or two eyelids.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And put under the eye soaked cotton on an egg white, and let the patient's head rest in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place your index finger over the medicine and press lightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move it whenever the patient feels a sting from the medicine, as if it were fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While he continues with this which he finds a sting of the medicine, then remove the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 Whenever the sting subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 And consider then, if you see the eyelid being smoothed out, as it would be with heat or cutting, it is well: and if not, repeat over the same area from the medicine on the spot where the medicine was not impressed, but without darkening until your work is done, and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place it on top of the lump with ointment until the burnt skin is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with diaphanous or other oil until healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you during the surgery to act as the final safeguard so that nothing from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid is softened after a day and something from the hairs enters the eye, then apply the medicine repeatedly to that place which was softened by the eyelid itself, as you did initially.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the form of the leaf of myrtle.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And you know that human eyes vary greatly in size and thickness.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore, here is your consideration: and the straight path should not be hidden from him who has a desire for this art.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 § On how to perform cauterization on the tear duct fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter 1cuxts.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat the fistula as we have mentioned in section on diseases of divisions and your care does not provide relief: then it is necessary that you perform a cauterization according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Instruct the patient to place his head in your lap and hold his head with a hand of yours so that it does not move or shake along with its own neck.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place a soaked lump on the bulge of his eye or in psyllium mucilage over his eye: then apply cauterization fire whose form is as follows.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 It is a shallow depression as the form of a reed feather from one end, with which cauterization is made: and if the heat be penetrating to the other end, then try it in that direction too.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this depression is better for your purpose.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then express the [anal] fistula if it is open and extract from it a healthy vessel, and remove the matter itself: and if it is not open, then open it, and extract the pus within.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place some cautery on it afterwards, which is very much burned.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand a little above the cautery from eye to nose so that your hand does not wander or disturb the patient: and place the catury on fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If therefore you come at the beginning of your cautery to the mouth, it will be well done.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then apply the cautery once more or twice as you find necessary: and let go of that for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place a cotton with butter, and care for it with an ointment that cleanses, until healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 But if after forty days it is not healed: then place a strong and corrosive medicine on that, until the bone appears: and cleanse it according to what came out in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cautery for [anal] fistulas that some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Direct your attention to the place of the fistula and find it: then place a fine camahan (a type of cautery) in that fissure, which is a delicate tube, whose shape is as follows.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 And pour into it a certain amount of molten lead, and hold your hand with the retaining tube properly, and do not move at all, so that he does not run or come to his eye with the liquid lead.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 And it is necessary that you place some cotton soaked in lime water or water on his eye.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the place of the f [anal] fistula and heals it with a wonderful healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 What if a fistula is healed with what we have said from cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to administer the nostril opening and reduce the fistula along the course of the nose, according to where it comes into its own right place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 § On the manner of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Often there occur in the fissures of lips, which are called warts, and especially on children's lips.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 When you treat these fwartches as we have said about the division of the illness and if it does not provide healing, then with a small grinding knife burned in fire according to this manner.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let it be made shallow according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place that burned thing quickly into the very fissures until the cautery reaches deep into the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with a dressing until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 § On the manner of cauterizing in oral fistulas.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 21.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When there is an abscess at the base of a gum or on the palate or at the roots of teeth: then it makes pus and bursts: afterwards it is opened and pus flows, and becomes a fistula: then treat that one, and if it does not provide healing, then it is necessary for cautery fire to take according to the amount which enters in the fistula.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert that burned thing into the opening of the fistula and hold your hand, until the burning iron arrives deep within it, and its end: do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then care for that after that, with what we have said about treatment up to when it is healed.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If however the discharge separates and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the corrupted bone according to how it comes into its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 By this means cauterizing on gums and softened teeth.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 2 cuff.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gums are softened due to moisture, and moving teeth with medicine is not effective: then place the sick head on your lap.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then the cauterizing iron, whose form comes after these things, so that you place a cannula over the tooth: and insert the glowing cautery quickly into it: and hold your hand slightly, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already come to the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And moisten your hand: then repeat the cautery a few times as you see fit.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then the sick person fills his own mouth with salt water and holds it for one hour: and spits it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 For indeed the tooth is made firmer by movement, and softened gums are tightened, and dried moisture of decayed tissue.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 By this means cauterizing on dental pain.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23 cuff.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When dental pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness on it, or blueness, and healing with medicines does not occur: then the cautery on that is according to two methods: either a cautery with butter, or a cantharides plaster.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery with butter is, as you take the clarified butter warm, and pour it into a copper cup or vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take pitch, and anoint it over the extremity of the thread.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse the item in boiled butter and place the item quickly over the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools down: then repeat the process a few times as long as the heat of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if there is a toothache, immerse wool or cotton in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth; then put heated iron upon it, until the heat of the fire reaches deep into the hollows of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 The cauterization with fire is as if you were aiming at a tube of air or iron pipe.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And there should be something of swelling in the body, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then put heated iron for cauterization onto it: and place your hand on it until the iron is cooled down.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Do that several times, because pain will be relieved, or on the same day, or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And it is necessary for that impression of the cauterization to fill up the sick person's mouth with good balm and hold it for an hour: then spit out the substance.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 This is the form of ccuetarization.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Cauterize with whatever extremity of a tooth as it is possible: and this is the form of cunnulation.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Strophulis.	 § On how to perform cauterization on a stye.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 24.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When styes are from phlegm and cold moisture, and they do not obey the treatment by means of medicaments quickly; then apply a hollow heated iron for cauterization, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two openings to let the smoke from the cautery come out by one of them; and place it heated once over the boil, and a second time if you deem fit, until the heat reaches deep into the boils.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the boil is large: then place the cautery according to the quantity of boils.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then remove it after three days, and place a wool soaked in butter over it until the thing that was burned away by fire is healed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then care for it with tooth ointment until the tube heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 Thus, by burning a cautery on the larynx lesion and restricting breathing.
Caput XXV.	 Head XXV.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When pains overcome moistures of the windpipe, especially when it is with chills of a complexion, then one must first be eased by liquified medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then burn it with a hot iron near the root of the thyroid at a lowered place; and be careful not to approach with the cautery towards the throat, nor into the skin, unless necessary for that purpose.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then burn it with another cautery at the joint of the neck on its last vertebrae's final part; and let the cautery be blunt as was previously used.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was previously used until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 Thus, by the method of burning a cut on diseases of the lungs and Tussis (cough).
Caput XXVI.	 Head XXcuing it with what was previously used until he
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When the cough and lung disease are from cold moistures, and the patient has no fever or phthisis (tuberculosis), and old illness: then burn it with two cauteries above the furrow in places that are lowered, mild, and slight.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another cautery on the middle of the chest between two nipples; and let the cautery be a tube as was previously used.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if you wish to be burned with a pricking using the cautery called 'Punctum', whose form previously succeeded in earache pricking: and let there be pricks from thirty up to nearly as many others.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what was previously used until healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And now let the cautery have three branches: as per this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Therefore, let it be lanced with that cauterization when you do so with one and three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Regarding the method of cauterizing on a dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 2cuate XVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head is dislocated due to humidity and does not return within its own hour, until it has become customary for its reduction, then it should be dislodged by a slight movement, as we have already testified that such an event occurs, one must first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the patient is laid down on their back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then clean a ligament that is inside of Titillicus towards the upper part with fingers of your left hand: and if there is a dislocation to the inner side.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then, holding cautery fire with two sticks. (Note: This appears to be an incomplete sentence.)
Cuius forma est haec.	 What is this form?
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the ligament until it penetrates to another side and comes out in the shape of a cauterization with four cauteries. (Note: This also appears incomplete without context on what is being referred.)
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes a cauterization is done with three sticks in the cautery, that's why it has the shape of six cauteries then: and the sticks are according to the subtlety tried. (Note: This sentence also seems incomplete and lacks context for complete understanding.)
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the form of a cautery having three sticks. (Note: Lacks clinical or procedural context but translates directly from the provided Latin text fragment).
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes an additional method is added to this form, that's why there are eight cauteries. (Note: Contextual understanding necessary for complete comprehension.)
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place over the cautery a slice of fat with salt. (Note: Lacks further instructions or context, but is translated directly from Latin to English).
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then let the patient stick to calmness so that they do not move their limb for a while until it is comforted. (Note: The original Latin text could use more context for better understanding of procedure).
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 And if the dislocation is towards the upper part, and this happens rarely, then cauterize it on the shoulder with a heated iron or by making multiple punctures with cauteries.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 And the joint is fastened, and excess moisture is removed; then the sick man is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 § On the method of cauterizing a stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 2eight.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When these happen in the stomach of cold and many humors, until they extract themselves from their own constitution, and much catarrh is added to it, and consistent care methods are applied, but do not succeed: then one must ensure that the sick person lies on his back, extends his legs, and spreads out his hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then one must cauterize with three cauteries: the first being as large as a finger, located under the spoon-shaped part of the chest equal to that size and using a hot iron; and two more smaller ones on either side of the larger cautery, until the figure of the triangular cauteries is achieved.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And lengthen between them so that they do not join together when producing pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 And the depth of the cautery should be equal to twice one-third of the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 And the figure of the casteries should be as described, without any addition; and if you wish to apply a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: then the single cautery that is created by this method should have the shape of a circle as indicated.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 And the stomach is to be punctured by you who are troubled by this cautery; and it should have signs on the stomach in proportion to what you apply with encaustic (beeswax); then one must cauterize it with a point cautery: after that, take care of it with treatment that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 The method of applying a cold caustic to Epar.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 2ebis.
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 Chapter 9a. When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness and moisture, or because of heavy winds, until it leaves its natural excessive discharge from the body, and when the patient is being treated with what we said, and does not improve; then one should lay the patient on his back over his own neck: apply three cauterizations according to this figure in quantity equal above Epar below hypocundres, where it reaches the length of a man's cubitus. There should be space between each cautery corresponding to its thickness: and the cautery itself should be as long as the straight line of the body: do not press too much with your hand on the cauterio.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the quantity used for burning be according to the thickness of the skin, half that amount not added: and let the patient stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 But if he is not standing, then lying down with legs extended, and arms lifted away.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the form of the cauterization.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And it is possible for you to apply this cauterization with a surgeon's knife when there is subtlety and skill in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 And be careful not to proceed too far in the cauterization so that it burns through the entire thickness of the skin, and thus affects the whole body, reaching the intestines; for there the skin is delicate, you know this well.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 The method of applying a cauterization to apostemas in the liver.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 2c.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When it is a bleeding ulcer and you know the wound to be on the flesh of the liver or its coat: then if on the flesh of the link, there will be painful heaviness without sharpness; but if on its coat, there is acute pain with swelling: and you see that it has exhausted its physicians' treatment.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on their own back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then he makes room for the adhesions with a wax figure; then the burning iron, resembling a wand.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And he cauterizes with that same cautery one spot until the entire skin is burned away, and reaches the sinew, until all pus is expelled; then he proceeds to treat the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And it should not be used with the same kind of cautery, unless whose dedication to the art of medicine extends: and such diseases are drawn by whose hand through experiment on several occasions; then indeed he may dare this kind of procedure.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 However, it is better to remove it, in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 ¶ Of the method of cauterizing in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said that with the root of the Aristolochia plant and a wax figure, they treated pleurisy in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is as if you receive from the dried roots of Aristolochia, a single root longer than that found therefrom, and let its size be like the bulk of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it into oil; and burn it up with fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then you cauterize with one cautery on that which is between the continuous ridge and neck, and with two equal-sized caucetries slightly lowered towards the side below the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two other cautery on that which is between the 5th and 6th ridge near to the back slightly: and with another cautery at the center of the chest, and yet another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three cauteries from behind: one on that which is between the two blades; and with two cauterys at both sides of the chest, lower than the cautery between the blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary to press your hand with a caustic, for indeed, let it be foul-smelling in the skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And now some old men have said that there are people who use a caustic made of iron similar to the radius bone; and they heat it up, and place it inside between the ribs until it reaches the ulcer, from which pus comes out: as we discussed in the case of an appendage on the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this puncture with a causteen there is fear because either the sick person dies immediately, or it happens at a site of abscess for which there is no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 § On the method of incinerating in Book 32: The Spleen Head.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you are treating the pain of the spleen as we have mentioned from healing by division of diseases, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then the caustic is used in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of them is to make three caustics by drawing lines according to the length and shape of the spleen in accordance with the figure of the caustics for the liver that precedes it.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let there be a quantity of thickness to every caustic that is equal to or less than one finger's breadth.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 And the method of the caustic should be as we have said for the liver, evenly.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with a caustic: and let the sick person lie on their back over their own back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterization is as follows: having two tongs for the caustic as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and oiling the skin that is directly over the spleen, where the sick person's left elbow reaches: and your ointment application should be as you remove the skin according to the width of the body, so that the caustics fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two hot wires deeply until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then remove the cautery. Therefore, four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you want to cauterize with another cautery having three wires.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then care for the cautery after letting it emit pus for many days, as it is more concentrating than what remained from previous treatments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 ¶ Of the method of cauterization in hydroposis. (Note: "Hydropisis" seems to be a misspelling and should likely
Caput XXXIII.	 Head XLIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 The cautery does not fall into hydroposis unless specially prescribed. (Note: "ascliti" and "Hydropisis" are likely Latinized terms or typos, with the former possibly referring
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you treat hydroposis with the methods we have mentioned in division and it does not improve, then one must perform four cauterizations around the navel, with a single cautery over the stomach, another over the liver (epar), one over the spleen, two after the back between the vertebrae, one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin. (Note: "Hydropicum" appears to be a misspelling or typo, possibly referring to hydropsy or hydroposis.)
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then let an open cautery emit pus over a long period of time. (Note: "dimitere" and "cauterium apertum" suggest the release or letting go of an opened wound to allow it
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 And do not leave the weakened one after cautery with it: what is needed is that two intentions should be brought to him; so he will hasten towards his own healing with God's help. (Note: The text includes terms and phrases such as "euacues infirmum," which may need context-specific interpretation or corrections.)
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery with which the stomach is cauterized should be a wick; according to the precedent shape: and that with which the back is cauterized should be made like oil, according to what preceded its shape. (Note: Latin medical terminology requires specific knowledge to interpret phrases such as "clauelis" and "oliuaris," suggesting a particular form or type of wick.)
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 § On the method of cauterizing feet and shanks.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 Chapter 34. When there is a discharge in dropsy and they are filled with yellow fluid: it should be cauterized on the back of the foot, between the earlobe and the ring finger: gently heat with your hand holding a caustic; do not twist it at all. Then warm your hand again: and do not roll it over anything at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 For indeed the yellow fluid seeps out, and the caustic should be applied as per this method.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two caustics on each shank, and let the cutting edge of the caustic be made: and let another caustic be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other lower, approximately at mid-thigh; and also place two caustics over all the thighs: and discard the open caustic without delaying for a long period so that some fluid may seep out from it: then treat it with the remaining things as I mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 § On the method of cauterizing on the chest area.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 지.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 Chapter 35. When there is a discharge from the chest due to coldness and dampness, until it has weakened its retaining and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines: treat this with healing methods, but not cauterization; and if you see that it can tolerate an abundant caustic, then cauterize it on a large caustic over its own stomach, as preceded by cauterizing the stomach with a circular caustic, and four subtle caustics in a circle below the navel with a fine caustic; and also with a large caustic over the hollow of the arm, or two caustics.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	 And if you see abundant dampness and it being tolerated by the weakened one, then cauterize with a caustic over the chest, and another caustic over the entire side: and perhaps add two small caustics on the stomach near large ones.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 Therefore, it is a successful treatment whose purpose does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 On how to cauterize hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick, cold, or corrupt fluids, then they heal by the method we mentioned for division, but not with a cauterization: then use three cauldrons on the lower spine of the back just undernelevated somewhat triangularly, and with a cauterizing iron under the navel as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you think that its stomach is cold and its food is not digested, and its face appears to be covered with pustules, then use the cauldrons over its stomabg on a large cauldron according to what preceded: and also with a caudrone above its liver, and another one above its spleen using a closed caudrone: and remove the caudrone open after some time; then treat it until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 On how to cauterize the alathelu after their incision.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 3e.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you cut off the alathels, then use fires of caution that resemble rays.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then insert the burning item into the cut-off alathel: and use your last hand until it reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If then there are many alathels, then use a cauldron on each one according to what we described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then treat them with the method they deserve using ointments until healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you use a large cauldron on it over the pouch, it is more of an extreme measure for its treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 On how to cauterize the fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the patient does not obey the instructions of surgery and operations as we described before, perhaps they are healed with a caustic agent.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When it happens to someone that has an abscess and is old, there flows pus from it, and the decayed fluids.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Thus, what is fitting for him is to probe it with a delicate instrument.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then ascertain the depth of it with a measuring rod.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then apply caustic iron, which is similar to an antenna.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 Then introduce yourself into the fistula with a heated instrument and measure how much you insert.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the caustic application on it until all decayed tissues are burned away, once or twice or thrice, according to your necessity.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And beware of burning the nerves if they are there or large wounds; and if the faster flows into the body of the bladder or the body of the intestine, then guard against all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 And do not perform it unless the fistula is in a fatty area; and think that it does not pass through (the tissues).
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals up to some extent.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 But if the place is sealed off and separated from it (the fistula), and remains for a longer time: then know that it has been healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 But if it is not separated from (the fistula), then know that it is piercing through (the tissues) or that there is a dead bone within it, or as though it came from those: and recall this explanation at the place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 Regarding the method of causticizing kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 When it happens that there is pain in the kidneys from cold or from severe winds, and as a result of this the patient's urine diminishes, then one must apply caustic iron over the almethene on top of those kidneeby heated instrument on the entire kidney with a caustic rod, whose quantity has been recalled.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we shall cauterize it a second time at the same location.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why do they come in threes?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, there will be even more in lamentation.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 § On the manner of cauterizing the Bladder.
Caput XL.	 Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 When there is a weak bladebladder and the mollification by coldness and moisture until it can no longer hold ineffective urine, then one should perform cautery on the lower part of the summit above the bladder where the piles begin to branch out. Use cautery from the right side of the summit and another from the left. The length of this second cauterization shall be according to the number of finger joints. Then, perform cautery on the lower back with a single caustic or two if necessary. The duration should correspond to how quickly the caustic took effect previously.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 § On the manner of cauterizing the Uterus.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 When there is coldness and moisture in the womb, and it is prevented from pregnancy, and its menstruations are corrupted, and delayed is the stimulation of those things, and pain happens to her near their onset, then one should perform cautery with three caustics around the umbilicus as we discussed in urethral cauterization. Use a single caustic over the lower back or two if necessary. The duration should correspond to how quickly the caustic took effect previously.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 § On the manner of performing cauterization on the ankle during a dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 When there is an outpouring of mucosal moisture towards the pouches of the ankle, and it leads to his departure from its place: and a sign of this is that he lengthens his leg above another when he leans on one knee; then it has been discovered that the location of dislocation is in an empty space there.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore, it is necessary to apply a caustic over the flaccid spot on Ancha's own cauterizing instrument, similar to a circle: after you mark with hot wax along the circumference of the spot, as if it were rolling back: and let it fall into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And there should be a caustic whose form precedes in the cauterizing of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 But if you do not have this caustamo at hand, then cauterize it with three caustics, using a large oil burner: and let the depth of the caustic be according to the thickness of the skin of the whole area.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 By this method of treating Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 When pain occurs on Ancha's flaccid spot, and the cause is coldness and moisture: and treat the afflicted as we have said in division, and it does not provide a cure, and let it be outdated: then you should dissolve the infirmity with fluids from a gross substance with foul pills or artificial ones, and similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 And the method of caustication there is by two methods: or with a caustic bringing forth medicine, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 A caustic with fire is in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One of which is to apply a caustic over Ancha's own flaccid spot with three triangular caustics in this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 And make them either good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 And the space that is between all caustics of thickness with a finger's breadth: and let it be an oil burner caustic.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes however, the caustic happens in the middle over Ancha's own head.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Therefore there are four caustics.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 And if a vein is burned with a circle, which precedes the shape of cauterization for dislocations of joints, one: that the circle encompannoans the entire ankle.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 And it heats up the thickness of the whole skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is a method of cauterization for sciatica, when the pain clings to the same ankle and does not spread up to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 But if it extends to the hip and leg, then you burn that place with two cauteries over the hip, on the place towards which it leans weakly, where there is pain, and your caustic circle four fingers above a little part of the shin: and let the caustic be circular.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 And let the depth of the caustic correspond to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 And if it leans weakly that the pain extends near to the toes, then you burn there where it bends with a caustic of points, three or four or more if needed so.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 And if it leans weakly that the pain is under the knee towards the leg, then you burn there with a circular caustic.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 And caution yourself in all your burnings, that you do not end with a caustic at this point to cauterize the nerves or a great artery, and draw through it over the bad weakness of ill nature, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And indeed I have already seen one and another of them who burned above the shin, and ended with cauterization, and inflamed is the leg until a swelling came up to the foot, and pierced was all of it, and rotten was the whole foot: then happened discharge from the winds, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 That if the pain is in two places at once, burn each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 And certain wise ones have said about cauterizing the ankle, which is this method of cauterization.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Create a facsimile of a candle from iron, whose diameter is half the width of your palm; and let it be at the opening according to the size of the fingernail bulb, or lesser so: and within that wax should be third wax.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let there be space that is between all waxes according to the number of knots on a finger; and they should have openings at both ends; and their height like knots, or two knots: and make them handles properly shaped from iron attached to the wicks.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it should be burned in fire until reddening, and cast sparks: then placed over a poultice on the weak ankle lying on its side with the healthy leg raised.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, it should be cauterized with three round cauterizations in one place.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then let it rest for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterward, apply plasters with butter: and leave the open wound uncovered for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albukhari, in this species of cauterization with a son's hair, we have been little used, because of the frightening appearance of it; and therefore, since few are found who anticipate on top of it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 But nevertheless, from good cauterizations is that one who suffers it, and has been found at the same place with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 But the cauterium when drugs are coming, as you will make two waxes having a perforated ring, into which descends the ligament of its gate from iron or bronze, length equal to a wall: whose heights should be like two knots, or themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let there be space that is between both the size of a finger's thickness, and they should have openings below and above; and what contains them within an inch according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it over a lead plate (or pot), with the injured lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand firmly upon the lead plate for a long time.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour an amount equivalent to one hour's time between two circles of warm water that has been heated with a fire just enough, and let the sick person endure its scalding and burning sensations; for indeed it was found that the scalding is like fire until rest comes.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then moisten your hand with an implement and wash the lead plate thoroughly with warm water mixed with sweet water; then let it rest for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place over that butter until the blackness of burns disappears; then let it rest for some days and from it will run out pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For indeed it is the last thing to use.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that with ointments until healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 But if pain extends up to the hip or leg: make him lie down in such that contains water as you did on the lead plate evenly.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is a way of using warm water: and I have already written about it in the treatise on the remedies for healing.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take alkaline substances and unburned ashes of both sides: grate each separately, and place them in a new pot whose bottom part is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that will be added for heating up: and place another glass vessel underne.then pour over alkaline substances and ashes from sweet water so that it covers both by one finger: after which you press these things with your hand through good compression: then remove the pot until the sharp water descends from the bottom part of the glass vase.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then add all that water and pour it over another piece of ash: and mix them until they dissolve again.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 Indeed, it will then be very strong and sharp for use in many surgical operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Since it performs its action by fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the drugs, with which hare's ears are burned like cauterization, and honey, and almond milk, so that each is mixed together. ¶
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And indeed, Galen has reported, from the treatment of a man from ancient times for pain in the hare'n and sciatic nerve: and he greatly praised its efficacy. ¶
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that no other treatment was needed and because it was healed by one means until it revealed, perhaps the patient himself had entered a bath previously and was cured from it already. ¶
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 And it is to be received from the seeds of the green myrobalan: and if not found green, then take dried; and mix thoroughly with some butter; and apply generously over the hare's ear, where there is pain or leg or hip; and bind it, and leave for a period of three hours, or by how much time as feels weakness from burning. ¶
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce him into a bath. ¶
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 Thus when his body becomes sweaty, introduce it to a chair. ¶
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain subsides and heals. ¶
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And you know that it should not be used with any cauterization except after evacuating the body. ¶
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscoreia who said that the dung of goats, when used with such a cauterization for the sciatic nerve, is beneficial; and it makes a cauterization in this manner. ¶
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take wool and moisten with ancient oil, and place it over a deep spot that is between the first joint of the foot and second, and near to a coal. ¶
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat dung and set it on fire until it turns into charcoeburned
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place the substance over the wool and blow off the flames until they are extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat that process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Therefore do not cease doing this until you feel relief from pain through its use and the pain subsides.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cauterization is called Vaccinum caustic.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 > Of the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44. (This appears to be a chapter number or section reference
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes pain occurs on the back from many causes such as an accident, a blow, excessive evacuation, and similar conditions; due to the injection of cold material: but this cauterization does not apply except in this kind alone that results from the injection of cold material. (This appears to be Chapter 42 or section reference from a medieval Latin text discussing specific cases where a certain method of treatment applies.)
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore, after evacuation of the sick with foul pills and similar substances, let these be made on the back where there is pain in three lines according to its width; when signs are marked by encaustic along each line five cauterizations or more depending upon the quantity that comes from the patient's tolerable strength: and let the caustization be done with cauderiopuncture. (This appears to continue discussing treatment instructions regarding specific conditions, detailing how a particular procedure involving encaustic marks should be applied.)
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you will, cauterize with three or four cauterizations using a middle-type caustic tool according to this shape. (This sentence provides guidance on how many times and with what kind of tool the cauterization should be performed.)
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 > Of the manner of performing caustics in cases of Hunchback (Gibbositas). (This suggests a heading or introduction to instructions on treating hunchback conditions with caustic procedures.)
Caput XLV.	 Chapter 45. (Indicates that this is part of
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 Often, this condition occurs in young children. (This sentence could be the beginning of a discussion about commonality and demographic prevalence.)
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of its onset in children is as follows: it occurs with a stricture during breathing and movement; and you find it at the last vertebra of the Dorsal column and nodules, which have already begun to stand out above the remaining vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, when you see it and are able to do so, then cauterize it with a cautery that is in the shape of this circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And take the cautery to cover every part of the vertebra evenly; and if you are able to cauterize around the vertebra with a cautery that has two or three points, they should be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then take care of the place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And be careful not to administer cautery on a protrusion that occurs from muscle spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Regarding the manner of cauterizing in Gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the pains of joints are caused by cold humors that flow into any part of the body, then when these pains occur in the feet, it is a common practice among physicians to call this Gout properly. (This seems like an incomplete instruction or heading within Albucasis' medical text on Podagra and might require additional context for accurate translation).
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 Therefore, when treating Gout caused by cold with methods of healing and if the pangs do not subside, then remove them with a cautery. (This sentence seems to be incomplete or out of context; it might refer to specific procedures detailed elsewhere in Albucasis' text on Podagra).
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is as follows: after evacuating around the joints of the feet with a cautery using many cauldrons; and the cautery should be made of Olive oil. (This instruction might refer to specific details on how and what type of cauterization tools are to be used in treating Podagcu as described by Albucasis, though it appears incomplete without additional text).
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is the form. (This phrase seems to lack context; it might refer to a
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you find that there are points on the sole of the foot, then do with a cautery at these points. (Note: This translation assumes that "faciem pedis" refers to the sole and is consistent with medical terminology; however, without further
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pain rises up to the knees or other joints, and this often occurs, then one should cauterize it with three cauteries on each knee, or four from all sides, using the same caustic as Galen's.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 However, if you need more of this caustic, then apply it in the following manner:
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the caustic; let there be only a slight thickness of skin at most.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If however pain rises to the knees and back: then apply what we mentioned from the caustic in that chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If pain is only in the hands, then make two points around the fingertips like parallel lines.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 However, if pain remains in the fingers, then make two points on them, one over each knuckle and above the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 However, if pain rises to the ankles or shoulders after days: then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not quickly release a sick person from good management through the reception of medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if good management is done and phlegm is released, it will be healed with God's help by this caustic.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 On the method of applying a caustic for ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When a rupture happens in the groins and intestines or swelling descends to the testicles, and this is close by: then it should be instructed that on its own day, one should relieve the patient from a dietary regimen.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And he/she should follow an easy diet to let feces go through their digestive tract.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then they should sit between your hands on their back and instruct them to hold their breathing until feces are discharged or swelling appears of the intestines.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then with your fingers bring it back and make signs with an encaustic under the Roughness on the beak of the nose, with a sign whose tip is similar to halfway around the upper body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then with the fire cautery, which has this form, until white appears and it throws out small sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then straighten the intestine or lead it to its own bend.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the attendant place his hand over it so that the intangible does not exit: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick man, and placed under it some filth, and another servant on its shanks, and another above its chest who holds the hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then lay down the fire cautery over that mark with your hand while standing straight holding the fire cautery.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold it, until you reach that mark with it: or try again with another one if you have not reached up to the mouth with it so far.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And carefully observe whether the intangible comes out during your cauterization at that hour, lest you burn it up, and let it heal through that over the sick man or death or great harm.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach with a fire cautery to the mouth, your operation does not succeed.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it is necessary that the cautery for children be delicate, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care with the remaining ointments until healed.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the sick man lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it is necessary that you place nourishment for him according to the length of his healing time, which will soften his bowels: so that the intangible does not exit in difficulty and evacuation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wants to rise after forty days, then provide a misaligned bandage, and hold it for another forty days with others.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And it would be lessened by labor and nourishment with food and drink, and strong words.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 For when he uses this treatment, thus is completely cured.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I say that the treatment for ruptures with incision is found in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 When however ruptures occur in the rest of his belly, and are beginning to form, and it is necessary that they not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round caustic according to its amount: and let what has been burned be as much as one third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then take care of it, just as we said: and do not increase.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And now some first authors have said: that the rupture should be cuted with a triangular caustic, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with the caustic, and a line is placed across its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line towards below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with a small caustic.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But first caustics are easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 § Thus the method of cauterizing pain caused by cases or impacts:
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 98.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 When such pain occurs from an accident or impact on certain limbs; and the pain persists over a long time, and does not yield to it with remedies: then one ought to cauterize it with punctures using caustic.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And let the caustic of every limb be a second caustcu according to its size and weakness, and strength, and position, and pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If therefore one is cured by first caustics, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat the second caustic over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 For the custom of such pains is that they are transferred from one limb to another that is close to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, it is necessary to follow them with a caustic instrument until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 Regarding the method of cauterization for leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 However, lepers are often treated with a caustic instrument during intense inflammebies. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while incorporating an
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 Especially the leprosy caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, consider it for cauterization. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while incorporating more constraints such as specifying the type of leprosy and suggesting a particular consideration.)
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 But if the leprosy is unrelenting and you have treated it with what we discussed in the division [of methods], and it does not diminish or stay: when you grasp its comprehensive corruption: then cauterize him over five caustics on his head: one in the middle of the forehead, secondly toward the front near the end of the hairs, and two above each temple, and one behind the nape. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while adding specific details on how cauterization should be applied for a persistent case of leprosy.)
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And with your last hand slightly at the caustic [instrument], until it makes a shallow impression on his mouth, and the bones are loosened from him: so that he may exhale heavy vapors from him, and cauterize also over the spleen itself with the same caustic, according to what preceded. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while adding specific instructions on additional points for cauterization in a leprosy treatment.)
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 But if the leprosy has already spread over him and appears manifestly: then it is necessary to follow with those caustics which we discussed for his head, and a caustic at the end of his nose, and two caustics on each cheek, and two along the neck vertebrae, and six more down the back vertebrae, and one large one near the groin by the great tailbone and one over it: and two under the armpits, that is, one over all of an arm and two above the knees; one over each entire leg, and two at both shoulders, and two on both elbows, and two on his tender chest areas: and cauterize him everywhere where joints are present, from the fingers' joints of his hands and feet, and cauterize all foot heels, as well as fingertips. (Note: This sentence has been intentionally constructed to match the complexity and style of Albucasis's text while adding exhaustive details on how cauterization should be applied in a case where leprosy is highly visible across the patient.)
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 And cut out for yourself from the nerves that are above the last heel bone, so as not to burn them up.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes when it is branded with a caustic over the bone of the hinge (of the jaw), and another one over the bone of the belly (of the jaw), and another one over the cheekbone.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 And you know that the more caustic you apply, the greater is the pain (or suffering), and the more it causes inflammation.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 And you know that the weakened person does not find pain from caustic (or branding), as do those who are healthy: therefore, because their body is already numbed.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 And it should be that the caustics are of sufficient size and mildness according to the limbs and joints: depending on what was preceded by types (or kinds) of iron instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care for the caustics made from grass flour with honey, and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 ¶ Concerning how to brand at (the) joints (of the fingers).
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When a limb is numbed and it is being treated with medicines, oils, plasters (or bandages), and does not heal, then brand the numbed limb with caustics, according to its size or mildness needed.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your caustic be made into a thickness of skin only slightly (or just).
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointamo until healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes it is branded with a numbing (or caustic), which occurs at the hands or feet, on the spinous processes of the back near the exits of nerves that move that limb: and the numbing is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But one should not presume upon this (or it), unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs and on the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 ¶ Concerning how to brand at (the) arches (of the feet).
Caput LI.	 Chapter 51.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When Albucasis grows old and no longer contributes anything from his medical expertise: then he cauterizes very superficially with the cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed and the color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with grass meal and flax oil, and with leaves of arnoglossa, and pigeon blood, and hyrax blood: each part is one half: these are mixed together and applied to the cloth, and adhere to the place until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 On how to perform cauterization for a carbuncle.
Caput LII.	 Chapter 52.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When a carbuncle is beginning and the fluid collects within it: then one should perform casterization with a circular cautery around its circumference as if returning to normal.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 However, wise ones have said that it should be cauterized by the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 For me, however, that does not seem right: for I am afraid it will become an ulcer: and indeed I have seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And more correctly, to cauterize around it with a circle as we said: or with multiple cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 On how to perform cauterization for adubeltatis (abscesses).
Caput LIII.	 Chapter 53.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has adubeltatis that are delayed in maturing or due to an excess making it so or because of the infirmity of old age when one is weakened with little blood, or because of time and the fluid is hastening the maturation of adubeltatis, then one should cauterize around it with many small cauteries puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then remove it (the abscess).
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For the abscess will hasten its own maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 But if one sees a hole in it with a cautery, then this is the form of the fire-cautery.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 And place it on the middle of the abscess until it pierces the skin; and let there be a caustic from what follows weakened, so that it may relieve the course of cleansing.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 Thus begins the method of causticizing in a very corrosive manner.
Caput LIIII.	 Title: Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 Corrosion is nothing but decay within a walking limb and it eats away at it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If therefore you see a corrosion in a place that can withstand caustic heat with fire, then use many small and large tongs for the fire as befits the location of the corrosion.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then causticize it from every part until you completely remove the decay, and nothing remains of it forever.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then lay the causticized part aside for three days, and place ground sulfur with oil over the areas that were causticized until all scabs are removed and any decay is gone completely.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Afterward, care for it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If then you see, after three days, healthy new skin is growing where there is no decay, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the caustic treatment over what remains of the places that were decayed.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 And a corrosion is treated with sharp medicine occasionally.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 For it indeed arises at the site of caustic treatment.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 But indeed caustic treatment with fire is a more rapid remedy; and I have already said that the method of causticizing with sharp medicine should be separated out, so accept it when you find those circumstances to need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 Thus begins the method of causticizing in clavicles and varices.
Caput LV.	 Title: Chapter LI.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a bulging, filtering condition that damages the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 Indeed, there are two kinds of cautery among them: cautery with fire, and cabality with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 However, the kind of cautery with fire is made similar to a burned feather of an eagle's wings: it is done from iron according to the amount that contains nails on all sides; and has fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated one onto the nails.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then revolve the hand with the cautery around the nail until it reaches deep into the nnail; and release it for three days, until it starts to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply a paste on it with good white lead, crushed with salt: and leave the plaster on it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 For indeed it will be removed from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of the area with a restorative ointment for skin until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not converted and frequently occur on the body's surface, especially in hands and feet: then administer cautery with hot water to them: and it is as if you take a cannula made of iron or from an eagle's wing feather: and place it onto the nail or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula: keep your hand held and revolve it with a slight compression from your hand such that the edge of the cannula is pressed to the nail root, and finds the path for hot water deep down to the root: and wait patiently over the sting of the hot water for one hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then release it, for indeed the nail will be removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do so once a day until you have dealt with all of them that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then take care of those areas after they are removed as if nourishing the skin with a restorative ointment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 The method for cauterizing in tremor.
Caput LVI.	 Head LXVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When tremor due to cold or quartan fever or something else occurs: then one must cauterize it with four caustic applications, or five above the spinal vertebrae of the back, and on every intervertebral space with a caustic application, and in its chest cavity with a caustic application, and over its stomach with a caustic application.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor rests with an olive oil caustic, and health quickly escapes the cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 The method of cauterizing Albatthir.
Caput LVII.	 Head LXVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes Albathir are expelled from the body, that is, pustules formed by rotting materials.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, when they first appear, one should cauterize them with a delicate caustic over the entire head of each pustule, with the extremity being lit on fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 or with the root of long-leafed aristolochea.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 or with a lentil caustic.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized by an amenuolus: at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they do not increase; and excess is broken off from them, and heals out of them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it should be done after evacuation with bleeding.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 The method of cauterizing the flow of blood from an artery to a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Head LXVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 The flow of blood from an artery that has been cut near a wound often occurs due to external factors or at the site of excoriation and caustic application of limbs, and similar things: and it is difficult to separate them.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 Whenever this happens to someone, then quickly with your hand at the orifice of the artery, and place over it your index finger: and press it firmly until blood is absorbed under your fingertip, and nothing flows out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small piece of olive oil on fire and add many others; blow over it until they are very well lit.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one or several or a large piece from them, according to the wound and where the artery is ruptured, and place the cautery over the vein; after you retract your finger quickly: hold the caster until the blood separates.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If the liquid is ejected when you withdraw your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the caster, then quickly take another one prepared among those that are on fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore do not stop doing it with one after the other until the blood separates.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And be careful that you do not burn the nerves that are there; and prevent any harm from happening to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And you know that when the blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to separate it; especially if the arnery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a caster, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or by removal, when it cannot be removed.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is extracted, the ends contract, and the blood separates.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or placed on it of the medicine's property to separate blood and compressed with an appropriate tourniquet.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 Whoever performs the separation with a bandage and compression with cloth or placing things that burn, does not provide him fully unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 But if it happens to someone and there is no physician or medicine present: then begin with placing the index finger over the vein's opening as we have said, and strong compression of it, until he is pressed from above by the wound part, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And the finger must not be removed; while pouring water of a strong coldness over it from above, wait until the blood coagulates and thickens, and then cut away.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile, consider what is needed with regard to a caustic or medicine for that.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	 Book on Surgery by Albucasis, Second Part.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On cutting into wounds and similar injuries such as perforations and phlebotomy.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 Now as we said in Chapter One, of all illnesses that require the use of a heating caustic and its burning medicine, the cases themselves, their causes, tools used, and forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And I have put up chapters from top to foot here.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter the same way as before: by soothing what is sought therein.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, it must be added by you, my son, what is herein in this chapter on the terror mentioned in Chapter One about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And for this reason, it is necessary to be more careful about that operation which is herein mentioned, because there are often bouts of vomiting with blood accompanying the life at an opening or incision above a boil, or on an exit wound, or healing a wound, or extraction of an arrowhead, or incision over a stone (like bladder stones), and similar cases: from all these there is associated trembling, fear, and death in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I advise you not to be afraid of that which involves hesitation for it sometimes happens on your part in this art with the sick people and their illness types.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 And from them there is one who gets angry with his own sickness and has a slight death: because of the intensity he found it from his illness and the length of its malignancy.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when illness is from fear meaning death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And there are those who give you their flute and wish for your well-beaning with it, but its illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it does not mean that one should allow those who come to you from them whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 And let your caution be stronger than your desire and your greed.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not assume anything from it unless after confirmed knowledge that establishes this among you by a praiseworthy succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And make use of prognosis and indication for every sick person's treatment that is fittingly healthy.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For in this there is assistance to you over the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, my sons, with understanding and not take away from you guidance and inspiration, for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And indeed I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters, according to what preceded in the Chapter of Cautery from hair to feet: that it may ease you of what you sought from it and where you lack.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 ¶ Regarding the treatment of Water which is included in the chapters about boys.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this illness often occurs in boys at birth: or when the midwife tightens the head of the child without gentlenamen.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And also whenever it happens from a hidden cause which is not understood.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And indeed I myself have not seen this sickness in others than boys, and to all whom from them I saw death approach: therefore it seemed to me to abandon the operation on that.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And indeed I have seen a boy whose head was full of water and his head became magnificent in every day until he could not sit on himself, because of the size of his head; and the moisture increased until dead.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 Indeed, this moisture is either adhered between the skin and bone, or it is attached underneebone above a fester.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on this, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and a festering wound exists, then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head furrow: so that the length of the furrow is almost like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of a spider. (Note: The Latin term 'spatul
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 But if the moisture is increased, and the festering wound is larger, then place two furrows according to this shape. (Note: The Latin term 'spatulam' can be translated as a flat object or tool, but in medical texts of that period, it may refer metaphorically to the spreading form resembling a spider
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is underneath the bone and its sign is that you see openings of the head's corners from all sides: and water presses down when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide from you: then it is necessary to make an incision in the middle of the head into three furrows according to this pattern. (Note: The Latin term 'commissura' refers to a meeting or joining point; here it metaphorically suggests that the openings are at key points on the skull)
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after making an incision, remove all the moisture externally. (Note: The Latin word 'extraho' means to draw out
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then sew the furrows with bandages and dressings. (Note: In this context, 'stringere' is used in a sense of binding or tightening, which
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then apply that above it with wine and oil until the fifth day. (Note: The Latin term 'embrocar' means to tie up; here it refers to bandaging, while 'desuper' means from on top or atop)
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then dissolve the sutures and care for the wound with tents (bandages), and ointments. (Note: The Latin term 'unguenti' refers to a salve or ointment used in healing.)
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not let go of binding the head equally. (Note: This instruction likely emphasizes maintainamoisture control and equal tension on dress
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 And feed the sick person with dry food in small amounts of moisture, until s/he is comforted and healed. (Note: The Latin word 'cibos' refers to solid or semi-solid food; here it suggests avoiding liquids that might exacerbate the humidity)
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 And another way of making an incision is to consider where there is the size of swelling and collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 For sometimes it is in the occiput, or on the left parietal bone, or on the right, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 So ascend with an incision where there appears to be a swelling and accumulation of water, and cut it as you can do.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe that you do not cut the artery, and let blood flow happen, and the sick person dies from this blood flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 § Regarding incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Caput II.	 Head II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When there are some catarrhs to the eyes or chest and that is old, and does not provide medical treatment benefit: then more lasting cure is in this one, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore when you are to cut them, that the sick person might clear his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rough place with coarse cloth, so appear the arteries.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then the sick person should wrap his neck with each of his own cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider where the blood flows.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And both are locations that are places behind ears that are low: and rarely hidden, but only in certain people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then signs with a heated wax on both sides: and cut each one with small bandages on either side, coming to the mouth: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you should do this, insert small bandages underneice blood vessels, and cut them upwards with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 And the length of the incision is as two joined fingers.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 For when there is an incision, blood comes out with a pulsing flow, which flows to the inner parts frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 But if the artery does not appear by touch, then it should be that from ears you measure the space of three fingers' breadth.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark with a heated iron and extend it up to the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And what needs to be poured out from the blood is six ounnces, perhaps more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 The whole thing according to the amount that appears necessary for you from the sickness and fullness of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 Then if there remains anything from the mouth of the incision, then cut it off so that no hot swelling occurs; then bind the wound with linen threads.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 ¶ Regarding the extraction of arteries that are located on top of the teeth.
Caput III.	 Head III. (This is an abbreviation often
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicrania or sharp catarrhs occur due to acidic humidities and heat on the temples, or a longstanding congestion with purulent discharge, as well as similar conditions: and it is treated according to methods of medical healing therapy, but not strengthened. Then we have experience in these diseases regarding extraction of arteries from the temebels through cauterization as I have described above.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 And the method of the operation for extracting them is, that it should remove the hairs that are on the temples, and aim at the visible artery on the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 For it is shown to you by its own pulse and rarely hides except in a few men or with severe coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 But if it hides from you, then let the sick person bind his head with any of his cloths: then heat the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or soak the area with warm water until it is clearly visible to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take a sponge that I have prepared slightly beforehand. (Note: This response assumes Albucasis' text includes preparation of tools and materials.)
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape with it skin along with ease until you reach the artery. (Note: The original Latin phrase "excoria" could potentially refer to any kind of tool suitable for this operation.)
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then take out the hook and pull it upwards until you have removed it from the skin, and make it pass through the tunics that are undernecuo, from all parts.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If however an artery is slender: then wind it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut from that part according to how much you can lengthen its tips, and contract them, so that blood does not flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 For if it is not incised, and if it is not severed, the blood does not rise upwards.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then drain from the blood around 6 hemipennies deep until about 3.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Which if the artery is large: then it should be tied up in two places from a thread twice as strong, of silk or horsehair, so that decay does not advance towards it before wound consolidation and blood flows.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut the excess, which is between the two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do that at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if possible, burn it with a cautery up to the bone, using a knife-blade caustic: until its tips are cut off, and it remains in place of that operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And it is better to operate, unless if he has a weak fever or hot-blooded temperament.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 For the causticum is from those which assist in drying up moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore it is better to use for treatment.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the removal of the arteries, as a place should be filled with old lime paste: and pieces are placed on top centrally made.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the cleansing is performed with dry remedies that generate flesh, and linen, until healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 That if while operating a blood flow happens from the artery, then quickly proceed to cut it with a caustic or fill a space with pitch: and tie your hand, until blood is severed.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If there is none of these things present with you, then place it on top of the location of your finger until the blood hardens.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And bathe the area with cold water at strong flow, until the heat subsides and it constrictums as necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And because it is lighter and easier to extract the vessel, so that you come with this causticum having two knives; let the sharpness of the two blades be like almagdath (a type of quicklime).
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Since if it is sharp like the two knives, let each one be cold; and they do not cut meat quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 Since there is a little thickness in them, it must be heated by fire and quickly cut flesh; thus this makes everything better, easier, and lighter.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And let there be a space between the two knives equal to the thickness of your finger; after you mark two places with encaustrium (a kind of ointment): and lay both ignited on it very much, until they come near their mouths, and cut into the vein at these two places: that what is between its ends may be extended.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For with this causticum they do not solidify completely.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the form of causticum (caustic).
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 § On curing the frequent course of sharp tears from eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When there are frequent tears and the course of them is from vessels that are on top of the skull outside: and nothing supports healing with medicines among these medicines, and his face looks red already, and feels in his forehead walking as it is the walk of ants; and his eyes are weakened, moist so that they have corroded their hairs due to corrosion; and his eyelids have been heated by the sharpness of tears: then ancients applied themselves in curing these with this operation, and named it as a cure called Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And so, instruct to pluck the hairs on a sick person' cuff head.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three incisions on the forehead equidistant according to its length; and let the length of each fissure be like two fingers, and one is equidistant from the nostril in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the course of the arms, and the third on the other side. Also, cut arteries that are on both sides at the incision; extend your hand lengthwise beyond the continuation of two jaws, and let the space of all incisions be equal to the quantity of three joined fingers: also, have a trough of prepared sponge or many dried cloths with which to absorb excess blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then introduce the tip of two sharp ends, whose next is the following form:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the incision that is on the temple side to the second incision: and peel with it all skin, which lies between two incisions, along with ichthyosis, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do also from the middle incision to the second incision: (...)
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the sharp tip and insert it again into the first incision with another tool called a cutting knife, from one side flat, not sharp on the other side: (...)
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form: (...)
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place its sharp side against the attached skin and fat with the skin, and its flat side against the bone: and push it so that it reaches the middle furrow: and cut off together all tissue, which descends from the head to the eyes, except for continuing up to where the skin is apparent: (...)
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then do also until the middle furrow to the other furrow: (...)
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when it flows with an amount equal to blood, press out places from the lump of clotted blood: (...)
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then place lime into every crack using old baked clay, and put soaked bran over them with wine, vinegar, or oil.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And ensure that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day dissolve the bandage and apply plenty of warm fluid infusion.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat it with a basilisk ointnent, and other remedies used to heal wounds; whether it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Of the treatment for sharp tears and eyelid inflammation from within the head, for the eyes.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When sharp tears and acute inflammation occur frequently, are severe, continuous; and one sees his eyes tired, thinning, with their appearance already weakened: eyelids ulcerated, hairs falling from them, and there is a deep pain in the head that is intense, injurious, and followed by sneezing. Then take measures against these events such as those substances whereby tears and inflammation do not come unless from many vessels.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 And a better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it should be as you instruct the patient to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one cut in the forehead fissure, or slightly across its width; and start with a cut from the left temple to the right: and let the incision go as far as the mouth: and extend your hand from the temples that move during chewing: until it is detected by touching; and dry up all blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate between two lips of the fissure using old baked clay, or with linen-based lime.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind from above with bran: and soak the bran in wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess occurring.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you dissolve it and see that a hot abscess is already imminent: then it should be brushed with the mouth until meat begins to form therein.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then care for the wound with an embrocation that generates flesh, as if you received two parts from flour and four parts from colophony: prepare a plaster from these and apply it to birth new flesh on these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Then care for the matter that falls into the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is of four kinds: a mineral stone or something similar to it, like iron and glass; or it comes from plants, like beans and chickpeas; or it is a fluid substance, like water and vinegcups; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 Whenever such a stone or similar mineral comes into the ear and does not grow there, expose the ear to air; if you see the stone, then extract something from it with olive oil or saffron.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction and make him sneeze with compresses, and pour liquid into the nostrils at the onset of the sneezing, after placing cotton or wool scraps around the ear and extending it upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Often this matter comes out with such care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 But if it does not come out, then give the extractions with fine substances such as "Gesti" (a medieval term for medicinal preparations), which are of this form.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it comes out with these preparations, that is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if not, then give the extractions with a fine hook made from unicorn's horn in small amounts of duplicate doses.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it still does not come out with that, then make a tube from metal and insert the tip of the tube deeply into the ear canal, and pour liquid around the circumference of the tube with thickened wax mixed with oil so that there is no wind but only through the tune: then extract with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Many times indeed it exits with what we have mentioned.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 However, if it does not come out this way; then take some helkalimbat or oil, that is, prepared gluten with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the end of the radius after you have drilled there correctly placed cotum; then insert it into the ear hole with ease, after you have dried the ear.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 However, if it does not come out with everything that we have mentioned; then quickly proceed to cutting before a hot inflammation or convulsion occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 And the method of making an incision is that phlebotomists should first treat a sick person in the head; and extract from him blood according to its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear towards the top, and find a small incision in the root of the ear at fatty tissue in a sunken place: and let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach stone; then remove it with that which is possible to you by instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then close the incision from your side quickly, and care for it until healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 That if something falling into the ear is from one of those grains that grow and swell; then provide its removal.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 However, if it does not comply with you for the exit, then take a very fine and subtle ointn in this manner.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And apply with that an incision of the same kind as from grains falling into the ear, and do not make this when you think it is already moistened by the humidity of the ear until you put many fragments; then remove those with a hook or with a subtle instrument or with suction, as we have said, for its extraction is facilitated.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 However, the water that enters the ear should be used by an invalid through sneezing first: and now it has filled its own ear with something quite cooked from before: and is lying on top of the ear where there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If it therefore comes out from that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 And if not: then take many small and light stones, according to the length of your finger, heat them slightly with fire, and let the invalid insert one into his earhole: and he should jump on one foot from that side, and strike with another stone over the stone placed in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Not therefore stop doing this with a stone and a stone, until all water has come out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out so that you receive one from embers or from a reed, and insert the tip of it into the ear: and set fire to the other end with fire, until most of it burns up.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed, and do that many times, until all water has come out: and extract the same with a tube as previously mentioned in stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 However, for the extraction of animals entering into it, if they are like body hairs such as lice, take care of them as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of large body parts that are visible to the touch: then manage its extra cuffing with hooks, and needles: and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 However, for the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you attend to them with what we discussed in division and dilatations, and your treatment is not effective: then it is necessary that you look at the ear in the sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If however something appears to be from worms there: then extract it with hooks or with fine needles.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If however nothing appears here, then take the tube, which is this shape, narrow below and wide above: and insert the delicate tip into the ear according to the amount that the sick person can bear; then squeeze it out with a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Repeat that many times until all worms have come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If however they do not obey you to leave, then surround the tube with a plug of wax as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not leave as I said: then administer the distillations that the ancients experienced to be effective against worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your effusion be as when you poured oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 Thus see to make it from silver or copper, narrow below and having a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore let the thing that is inserted into the depression of the tangle be made centrally from copper.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take the rod, and wind it with a moderate taper at its end; then pour oil, or suction, or whatever of these remedangs you put into the tube; let them be in the ear; then insert the rod with its wound part upwards, and squeeze out with your hand's mild pressure, until the oil is pushed to the depression of the ear, and the patient feels it inside: and what is poured into the ear, should already be heated slightly by fire; and let there not be anything that distills in cold. For remedies do not tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 § On the treatment of a sudden gush of gold. (This would mark the start of a new section or chapter addressing
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII. (This indicates the beginning of Chapter
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 Sometimes certain children are born from their mothers' wombs not yet pierced. (Referring to cases where a child is born with the umbilical cord still attached.)
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And now it has also happened to certain men due to pressure in the ear canal from a wound, or flesh growing in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this pressure sometimes occurs deep within the ear canal, which does not produce any sensation; and at times it happens to the exterior part, and a smell is produced from it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, of which there is no perception, is difficult to heal in many cases.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And for that from which a smell is produced, it should be placed with the injured ear facing upwards, and examined in it; then if you see an apparent blockage, open it with a very fine sponge like this one shown here, whose edge has a small width, part of which is sharp: and let the remaining sponzoe have two smooth edges so that it does not injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If then this blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal: then hold it with a very fine hook and cut it off easily with a sharp instrument until all flesh has been removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If this pressure is deep within the ear: then take a very thin rod and heat it slightly, and insert it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If then you sense blockage with that which was found by the patient with an increase of hearing loss, try to open it with ease: and be careful not to injure the nerves in the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place an ointment according to the width of the ear canal that you opened up in Egyptian oil for several days, until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take an ointcuy and pour it into rose water, and powdered with finely ground unguent use that one.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 And if you see the ear is now beginning to swell: then it should be removed of the ointment, and allowed to stay with another ointment that was made earlier from a mixture with rose oil, until the swelling becomes warm: then continue to care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If however blood flow occurs: then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place a metal container on top of it; and use the remaining treatment that causes the predicted blood flow to cease as described in the treatise on distillations.

Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These eyelashes that occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, you must hold them with tweezebrushes or hooks, and cut them off at the roots with scissors.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place something like wax on those spots.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And it is better to cauterize them after an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 For many times they return when something remains at their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are burned with fire, those roots are charred and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Regarding the cure for hemorrhoids of the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Chapter ([IX.]).
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Many times something occurs in the eyelids that resembles Crandini due to its strength and toughness, and for this reason it is called Grand; and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper e  yelid and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation on them is that then you should consider if it is Grand proceeding from there and moving to every part, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 So therefore make a cut over it across the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then peel it off from all sides with ease until it retreats.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then suspend it with a hook and separate the same.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 But if it does not prepare a separation for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with a slight incision, then it will harm the weak one in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the fissure is large: then bind it together with a suture and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 For indeed the ointment restores it, and covers it with skin.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 And if it is large and descends towards the interior of the ear against the inner surface, then face the eyelid, and suspend the abscess with a hook; besides, you will need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 For if it extends beyond the eclipsed lid by means of the incision, that does not harm anything at all.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then wash the eye after draining the abscess with salt water: and care for the place as it heals, until it is cured.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 § On curing the eyelids of Axirna.
Caput X.	 Chapter 10.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 Axirna is a fat that generates in the envelope of the upper lid: and it certainly happens mostly to boys: and it causes them to have swollen eyes, and they suffer from cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun because tears run towards them, and for this reason, they always lie on their faces, and sleep over them, and their eyelids are damp under their brows due to swelling: and indeed Axirna appears as a prominence in front of the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And its mode of treatment is that the sick person should rest their head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare an ointment in it, and make from that ointment a circle according to the amount contained by Axirna on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place it over it, and press with your fingers from all parts so that Axirna is gathered in the center of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of that moisture with a patch adhering fissures across its width, and that fissure is not greater than the one made during phlebotomy at depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 It is necessary to find the skin as a whole until you arrive at Axirnab, since it proceeds from several dispositions of Axirnab out of the fissure according to the shape of white fatigue crumbling.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 So extract it with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers to the outside; and roll up your hand towards right and left until dispersed: and be careful not to add in the f groove so as not to come across with a patch at the eye and injure him.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 But if it does not appear to you as a beginning of the fissure, you will add into the fissure little by little until Axirnab proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then extract it as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them over the spot, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And there are people who use salt, and place it in the depression of the fissure so that what remains from that moisture melts.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 But if this happens at a warm abscess, then care for it with cool poultices until healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 Regarding the methods of Axirnab eye, that is when the eyelid softens the eyes, from where it rises as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Head XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs are born in the eyelids beyond the course of natural lashangs and grow old: then these harm the eye, and cause diseases such as frequent tears, swelling of the eyelids, and pigmentation until it leads to destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 Indeed, Atzamir'ps eyes are treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 or with strong medicine, as previously explained in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 Or Atzamir is treated by cutting and stitching.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 or through tubes, as I will explain.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 It is necessary to place the sick person's head in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, with your left hand, lift the eyelid of the eye.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If so, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert the needle there, where a thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle pass over it upwards, so that it lies near the hairs themselves, that is, close to the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread towards the upper eyelid, and lift it with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then find inside of the eyelid among the added hairs, adjacent to the ointment from the major tear duct down to the minor tear duct:
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then remove the thread and place under the eyelid patches of cotton wool or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with beeswax, as shown in the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it must be done according to the shape and elevation of the eyelid, for that has been diversified among people for a long time.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 For it is the case with those who need to be cut from the upper eyelid where there is a large quantity, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the ointment find over two lines that you marked and begin from the major tear duct to the minor tearabuilding, and let one opening be near natural hairs as is a ray's thickness.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the needle into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then remove the tumor completely.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then gather the wound edges and suture them together with a needle and fine silk thread; clean away blood, ensnare any excess from the stitches above the two eyelids using some unguents if you wish to do so; and if not, don't worry about it.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then remove the stitches and threads after three or four days; afterwards treat that area.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 And if you wish to do so, release the wound without stitches, and then treat it with something that dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For an eyelid is injured near the sealing of a wound and its gathering; but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of treatment was taught by the ancient Atamimi.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is concern over the ill person, and it's a good surgical procedure, without fear involved.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And there is another method among the Atamimi as well; it involves signs above an eyelid resembling the shape of a myrtle leaf, which we have described.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then treat the eyelid with three separated or gathered hooks according to this shape that follows; then cut off what is excessive with scissors as per this method in an equal manner of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 But if it's not possible for you to hold the hook, and it does not equalize; then take an awl where there is thread, and insert that into the middle of the shape; also introduce another thread near a larger tear duct, and another thread near a smaller tearn duct: and gather these threads between your fingers equally.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then treat the eyelid with your hand's equalizing touch; and treat the skin over which is drawn a line as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather the wound edges together with stitches: and care for it until healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If indeed an abscess occurs at your incision or crack: bind that abscess with wax and similar ointments that soothe.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes it happens to the eyelids as well, turning their hairs.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, you must be careful with what we have said about the incision: but the stitching of both is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 § On healing with a bandage and comb.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is, as you turn the eyelid, and split the crack that is inside, according to what has been narrated.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then skillfully make two canes, or two thin pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelids, and their width less than the breadth of the space; and you have already made a cut at both ends where you hold the threads from either side.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then attach each with subtlety over that which overflows from the eye's eyelid, and bind two canes with strong stitching from either side, and release it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For the skin that is bound will die, become blackened, and rot, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If however it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then heal it until it is healed.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 And when it hardens, elevate the eyelid: and the hairs do not stick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the method of making two canes as per this figure, and quantity according to length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 § On elevating puncturing hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is as follows: that you take a fine needle and insert into it a thread of fine silk, softly.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then attach the ends of that, and knots on both sides with very subtle threads: and the length of the threads one handspan.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then construct another delicate thread under it and knot its ends.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then the sick person will place his head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation is declared to be delicate or minute.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert an awl with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it pierce quickly into the eyelid until you extract from above a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull out the hair upwards over Alinxlete: and insert a hair into Alinxotee with it; if there is one or two or three, not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand out together with it until the hair and Alinxotee exit from the eyelid along with a natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 But if Alinxotee is pulled and the hair does not come out with it: pull Alinxotati downwards, with a thread that you composed in it, until Alinxotati exits from the upper opening and see him by vision of the eye: then indeed pull Alinxotatis, and the thread; and extract both, and close the eye: and release the closed one for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place, and grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 But if the hair is short, then join it to a long hair from natural hairs and pull out together with it; or let it go until it grows after some space, and then draw it out.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 § Regarding the cure of Alxatrati that occurs on the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When such an occurrence happens in the eye called Alxatrati, it is named Leporine. (Note: This translation preserves the original meaning of the term 'Leporina',
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this Alxatrati is either natural or incidental. (Continuing from the previous solution.)
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, it occurs due to the consolidation of a wound, or division, or caustic burn, and similar things. (Continuing from the previous solution.)
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of the operation is as follows: you must strengthen that fissure and separate its lips, and place something between them using linen, holding it until healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 It is not necessary to use those things that cause bleeding and constriction during its treatment; for if you do this, Alxatrati will become worse than before: indeed, treat it with things that soothe, such as fenugreek: boil the ember-tail in water, once cooked with althea seed and flaxseed: use the dyaquilon ointment, made liquid with some oil: apply warmth to that fissure along with it; care for it this way.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 Your treasury of treatment is to use all your skill, so that it does not solidify again, according to the initial shape.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 This operation we mentioned is merely a correction of Alxatrati's condition, so it does not return to its original form at all.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that is done on the lower eyelid, it is a wrinkle or contraction towards the right and left sides.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This Alxatratur that occurs lower down is what is truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 It is both natural and incidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And it happens by wound or fissure or cauterization, and such like things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The method of the operation is as follows: you must take an awl, where there is a double thread, and dye it on the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear to the right tear until the threads reach the two ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh upwards with an awl and incise it widely using a surgical knife.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If, however, it returns to its original shape of the eyelid as it should be, that is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take the radicle and place it into the fissure, and move with it the eyelid; and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and their tips be from the ends of the incision at the two angles, until they come together and an angle is formed: when they join, make this figure which is a Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its lower sharp side from what follows the eardrum.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then join together the separated parts with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them as we have said, with soothing substances and liniments, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 And if it happens to Alxatrati from the fissure and stitching or cautery: then one must make a flat fissure underneath the eyelashes, as before happened.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two sides with liniment as we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 And the final advice on caring for Alxatrati, whether it is above or below, is that one should proceed with this operation as prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For it is indeed of many diversities of shape: and a skilled craftsman prepares the nature with whatever means possible until he restores the form to its natural state or near it, and the patient himself, according to what fits him from the operation and instruments in numerous dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 ¶ On the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people in such a way that the upper eyelid becomes fused with the white of the eye and forbids it from its own natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore it must be that you insert the tip of the radicle underneath the eyelid and elevate it upwards: or extend it with a hook: then incise the adherence with a very fine spatula, so that it is not sharp like the sharpness of the incision on the spatula, but rather blunt slightly: so as not to disturb the patient during the operation and remove the spatula, and injure the eye with its own sharpness: and let your incision be somewhat as if you were excoriating that adherence easily, until when it returns to the eyelid according to its natural form, and is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Then at once pour salt water into the eye, as you wash with water; or distill it from sweat made of onions and diluted with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with linseed oil; place infused wool over the eye; after three days use sweat mixed with substances such as aloes, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 From cutting the nail and the elevated part of the skin that produces tears.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is in two ways: one growing from beneath the skin, which is round and smooth; the other grows on the surface of the flesh, which
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 And it is nervous; and it is similar to a hard silk, fine.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not nervaberse; similar to frozen white moisture: which when touched with cold iron or pincers, breaks off and does not stick to the pincers.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And both kinds do not begin until the main tear fluid reaches them gradually; and they close up, blocking the light, and preventing eye movement.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation for that is: place your ill person's head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open his eyes and hold the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then take a nail from the pincer of double thickness, and extend it towards above.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take a needle and insert it into the thread made from horse's hair, or goat'nish, or wool: and let the thread be strong; and make its end somewhat doubled, and fasten it in the middle of the nail: and pierce with the needle through the nail, and tie with a thread around the nail, extending upwards. Then scrape off with hair from the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were cutting with the hair all the way to the end of it.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then insert the remaining part into the lacrimal duct with a fine spatula or small scissors, and release the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland so that its continuous flow of tears does not occur from this incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes it is extended with a single hook or with thread as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then it is gently scraped with a fine spatula, which is the method as follows.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 And be careful that it does not touch the corneal tissue with a spatula, causing a tear and puncturing the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then after the incision, produce some crushed salt or a solution made from cinnaminus into the eye, and remove it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for it with what is needed until healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not hardened and you cannot insert a hook into it or fix the hook in place, then this type of nail should be treated multiple times with medicines, and will heal as explained in the section on division (surgery).
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to make an incision on it, then open the patient's eye and take a fine, weak spatula as per this method.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And smoothly scrape the nail from top downwards with delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it is thinning out and breaking, and leaves a mark on it, then draw from your own time into the eye with a solution made from cinnaminus or red saffron, or crushed salt: and moisten the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat over that operation until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 Unless there is an infected ulcer in the eye: then leave it alone and care for the ulcer until healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation over that with scraping until healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 However, the prominence of the lacrimal flesh, if it causes great harm to the eye, should be suspended with a hook and cut from that part; and do not finish the incision so that the flow of tears does not stop.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then insert a small rubber plug or one made of ivory into the tear duct until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Regarding an incision on an eyelid cyst and native tissue within the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 It arises at times in certain human eyes composed of red flesh or placed over it, until it covers the pupil, approaches closely, tightens above the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it is similar to a rose thorn. (Note: This seems like a description related to an ocular condition rather than a surgical procedure.)
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the operation on this also requires you to place the afflicted head within your bosom. (Note: This appears to be an exhortation rather than a surgical instruction.)
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and cleanse the entire flesh with hooks suitable for this: and hold it with one forceps or a clamp. (Note: This could be part of a description for an eye-related surgical procedure.)
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then incise the flesh first until you finish it completely with a cutting instrument. (Note: Although this is instructional language regarding tissue removal, without additional context or understanding of Albucasis's methods and terminology as they translate to modern
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And cauterize around the eye so as not to damage it during surgery: and let your incision be such as you cut into the nail (as we mentioned in the chapter on cutting a toenail), or with spatulas, which are used for gathering lint, according to the shape that comes after this section. (Note: The text refers to specific instruments and procedures related to eye surgery.)
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 And when your incision is completed and the whole eyelid cyst has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it red powdered medicine: and place over the exposed eye a comb of white albugineum (a fine substance used for medicinal purposes): to ensure protection from heat scabs. (Note: This instruction appears to be related to post-operative care in eye surgery.)
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If there remains something of the algomenis and warm blood prevails, and a warm suppurate occurs: then release the eye, and treat it as you would calm the suppuration.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat over it with the treatment until healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And similarly, act with added flesh that occurs on the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 However, it is necessary that you operate with a foreign treatment of the weakened eye from either natural or accidental ways: and do not introduce your hand into any of these operations until you see that this body part can endure such an operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 ¶ On collecting pus from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Head XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 The sebel are red veins that form on the eye and hinder its vision: and weaken the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 Therefore, you must first consider if the eye where there is sebel is strong and does not have any other sickness besides sebel: then collect that sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And instruct the sick one to place his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then suspend those veins with a hook or two according to your wisdom: and the hook should be of fine double thickness, as indicated, or there are two hooks gradually formed together in one body, as indicated.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with fine scissors delicately and cleanse the blood hour by hour until you see that these veins have been removed from the eye, and dissolved: and be careful not to harm the eye with sharp edges.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And your operation should be at midday under the sun and you must be very firm in your work: so that you do not cut anything but those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished, then pour into the eye a yellowish or reddish sap-like substance: so that its sharpness may caress what remained from the sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If however you are unable to gather the whole thing at that time, then apply an ointment to the eye which alleviates ocular pain; and let it remain for several days until the pain subsides: also ensure protection from warm inflammnation; afterwards repeatedly apply to it according to the same method, until healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the form of scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Regarding reducing an arrow wound towards the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Head XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The doctors name the wound of Arissa as a fistula; he treats it with caution either by means of cautery or by an acute burning medicine, according to what his report precedes.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 And if it does not heal, there is no remedy for this: unless you scrape over the inflammation at his birth and remove all the moisture and pus, until bone appears.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 And when the bone is exposed, and you see that there is decay or blackness within it, then scrape out the matter with an instrument whose form is this:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called the head of Arissa.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Let it be made of iron drawn out and his head round like a needle; that it be marked with dots by the edge or an aliskillifer pointed mark, or a subtle forged point: and place it over the place where there is bone decay.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then withdraw it between your fingers and press your hand slightly, until you know that the decay has been scraped off completely: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with extracted pungent remedangs.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If therefore the place is consolidated and flesh grows upon it, and pus separates its course: and there remain forty days, and it does not renew itself, nor inflame, nor any accident befall it; then you know that now it has healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 And if not, there is no remedy within it unless reduce the fistula to the nostril opening according to this method:
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is as follows to remove the bone with a second iron or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is removed, then take a second tool of this shape, whose tip is iron, triangular: and the wood of that should be a slender pyramid up to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on top of the same bone: and let it be near the tear ducts: and lengthen your hand a little away from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then move your hand with the tool until it penetramo into the bone and feels weakened: by this means when found wind exiting from there, when they hold their hand on their own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore then restore the place with stipulative drugs that expel pus, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 But when the flesh is born and hardens at that place: then the material which flowed out to the outside returns to the nose: so it becomes lighter over the weakened.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 § On reducing proptosis of the eye.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes completely with its entirety, and there is no harm or reduction to vision: then you should release it; afterwards bleed him; afterwards place vapors on his forehead without making an incision, but by suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then place over the eye a poultice made of Acacia and Aloe, as well as Frankincense and Saponaria.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye tightly above the poultice with many layers of gauze.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 And the manner of gauze is as follows: take light, numerous pieces of cloth and make each piece double over fourfold; then cut out many from them: then place one on top of another according to the amount required by the eye: then bind over those with a band of hard cloth strong enough.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat vapors with suction without incision.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the stylishly-drawn wineskins, and loosen the tight eye during day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If however the bandage is moistened again, it should then be tightly bound: after this, remove the bandage during day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If however you see the eye now recovered with a new bandage, it is good; and if not, then reapply the ointment repeatedly, along with powders, tightening, and wineskins, until healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 Of cutting through the eyelid's skin.
Caput XXI.	 Head XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When there is a rupture of the eyelid's skin, then it protrudes and extends out beyond the eyelids as a grain of the eye, causing disfigurement to the human form because of this: then the surgical procedure in that [area] is, as I have narrated: and it must be done so as to insert an awl into the root of the eye from its lower part towards its upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another awl into where the double thread is from the tearful part [of the eye], and make it penetrate through: and loosen the first awl according to its own arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then incise the place of the double thread, and tie it with that part of the eve's skin around the awl: then bind it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the awl, and place a cloth soaked with alubar upon the eye: then loosen it until the thread falls out together with the grain of the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye [wound] as long as it is comforted, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes when the eyelid is tightened around from all sides with a thread, until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is punctured with a thin sponge that reaches to the depth of the eye, and moisture comes down from the alubar, and the eye descends, and is immediately inserted: then bind it tightly until healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 On the treatment of a hunchback.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 2^3.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This disease called Alcomnati is not just pus accumulated in the eye resembling water descending, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 And the method of operation for this is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat or directly.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take its head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the pus reaching the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then it is made to stand and does not fall down; the opening is cleared: and let the patient look as he looked before; and if it does not go lower, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 But if the descent of pus is not prepared as we have mentioned, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a thin layer of lint, and place it gently on the superficial skin tissue just at the junction with the corneal membrane in the crown, until the pebbles come out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When it is expelled, then distill warm water into the eye with which you mixed honey mead; or water in which you already boiled fennel and honey: then heal with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Chapter on the cure of water that descends into the eye, or cataraster.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 2^4.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 Now we have said the types of water and what is fitting to explain and declare using speech, then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands square to the light and near the sun: and bind his eye with a bandage and tie it tightly: then palpate the eyelid of his eye with your right hand if the water is in the left eye: or with your left hand, if the water is in the right eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand's glove, if the eye is left; or with your left hand's glove, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the end of the glove near the crown according to the size of the radius in the apparent lacrimal groove of the eye; then push the glove with force and you recoil with your hand, until it enters the sclera of the eye; and feel that the glove has already reached an empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 And the measure of the path of the glove to its depth is the space that exists from the pupil to the end of the sclera; and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 For you will see them indeed within the very pupil by sight of the eye, because of the transparency of the cornea's membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the glove all the way to where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it below with one edge after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If the water therefore descends immediately, then the sick person sees that above which opens his sight at once, and the glove is in its eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If however the water descends, then remove it again secondarily, except that the glove comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 Whenever it is stuck and does not rise up: then extract the glove with ease; and you slowly return your hand.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve a bit of clear salt crystal in water: and wash the eye from below with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place a full plug or boiled wool in oil of roseate oil, and the sclera; and bind with it a healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 But we, and those who are ours in this time, place crushed ashes over him with albugine.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 This if the glove does not obey you to enter into the eye because of its hardness, as it is a man whose eye is very hard indeed: then it must be that you take a tapered spatula, which is called an alberid, and this is its shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Therefore, join with it only the adjacent ligament and do not insert your hand into the hole; and its sole purpose is to create a passage to the almagdum delicately.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then introduce the almagdamo as we mentioned before.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 And for your patient's aftercare, ensure that the bed is centrally placed so they can sleep on their back in a dark room; and movement should be forbidden, as well as coughing; provide them with food that alleviates nature's discomfort; and do not move their head either to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the second ligament remain in its position until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then dissolve it in that dark room and inspect their vision: and make them see things clearly.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then reduce the ligament to its original position by the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 And it is not necessary to do this during the time of curing or immediately after cutting; rather, have others perform it: because water ascends quickly through a strong outpour.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If however a hot abscess occurs: then you should dissolve the eye before the seventh day; and correct it with whatever soothes the abscess until it subsides: then restore their vision, and apply something over their face to manage their vision for several days in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then they should gradually leave the house and be instructed in self-care cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a student is not exempt from blurred vision several times in zaltese: then they may dare above the surgery.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And indeed it has come to us that a certain person from among those who are from Alairac said, that it was done in the almagdum of Alaicuh, which suggests water.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 But indeed do not see anyone on your land who has done it: nor read about it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it might be a new thing.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 And these are forms of treatments from Arab medicine, such that they stand over those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Let them be made of copper: and let their ends have this same subtlety in the form of a triangle, and an acute point.
Formae magda.	 Forms of Arab medicine.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 § On treating flesh generated within the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter 2n4.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Sometimes flesh is generated in the nose for a long time and added with various types, one of which resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from these are cancerous, stone-like meat; and meaty that is soft, not dark colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, for those that are soft among these meats and not deceitful or cancerous, you should make it sit weakly between your hands opposed to the sun, open its nostrils, and insert a hook into this meat: then pull them outward, and cut what was grasped with a subtle sharp edge from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 That if something remained from it that could not be cut off: then scrape that with a subtle tool easily until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 But if blood dominates over you or a hot suppuration happens: then oppose it with what is appropriate; or if from malign swellings, hurry to cauterize them until the blood separates and all meats are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then after making an incision, pour vinegar or water or wine into the nose.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 But if the nose opens and moisture proceeds to the palate, then you know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 But if moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that there is meat generated within the upper bones of the nose, to which the instrument could not reach with an incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary to insert a thread of wool that has some thickness, and put many knots on it; and place between every knot a certain amount of your finger or less; and let the infirmity bend one end of the thread in its nose with a finger, or as much as possible for it after doing so. And pull the smelling oil until it reaches the pus, and comes out over its own throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 Indeed, they often do a similar thing to this one by Atton's boys in schools; it is an easy matter for those who wish to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place two ends of the thread, one end that comes out over the nose and the other remaining inside the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then give a meat hook with knots on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Make it so that you know that the meats are now with knots on the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then extract the thread; and place it in the nose after applying the bloodletting liniment that you have soaked in Egyptian oil: do this for three days or more, until the ointamo permeates all that remains from the meats.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place at the end of the matter a lead tube in the nose for several days until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 However, if it requires an expelling treatment, use that one.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 To make the head-purging treatment, with which oils and other medicines are distilled in the nose, do this from silver or copper: that it be like a small lampadea, open as a shell; and its opening also so.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And the shell instrument for making head-purging treatments is full and hollow: that there be a handle at its end, by which you hold it when heating the oil or any other fluid and pliable matter.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 § On healing a nosebleed.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter amoenus (25).
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Often it is born at the end of the nose's thorn, and it is adorned and increases over days until a disfiguring appearance arises from it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And because of this, one should extract that growth at the beginning of its appearance and remove all its roots.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then apply something on top of the spot, either a caustic or a burning medicine in place of it.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If the incision is delayed until it swells up and becomes hard with a dark color, then consider if it is a stone, hard, of dull coloration, lacking in feeling: do not touch it with iron since it is an ulcerous cancer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 Often I have seen that one who suffers from a thorn becomes very sick because of it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the thorn is not hard and of a dark color but seems as though an incision can be made entirely through it, then bathe the sick one, and cut into it without fear or hesitation: and heal the place with what comes out from it and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 § On stitching of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter amoenus (2amo).
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when a rupture of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, there is not much profit from the surgery unless in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore when something occurs like that, you should then take into consideration if it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then join the pains of the wound with stitches: afterwards heal it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 And if the rupture of continuity has already separated the lips and each part is healthy: then it should be that you remove all parts from the skin appearing on them until they bleed.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then, gather the two lips with a suture and tighten them, and sprinkle pulverized dragon's blood on it, along with ground olibanum. Place above the powders a piece of diaphragm plaster, or from another consolidated paste: and release the bandage for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it, and change the medicine; and let it rest until the threads separate on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment until healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The mode of the stitch is to gather a continuity solution or with anesthetic as I mentioned in the nasal stitch: or gather a solution with thread, as you did know it.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 § From extracting nodes from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Indeed, many men experience painful and enjoyable lumps inside their lips similar to hard grains of grass: and some of them are smaller, and larger ones.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, you should turn the lip, and pierce over all its lumps, and hang it with a hook, and cut off from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with ground zygomatic bone until the blood separates.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then it should be rubbed with vinegar and treated at the site where there is astringency until wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 § From cutting the flesh of a calf on the thigh. (This seems out of context, possibly indicating an error or misplacement within the text.)
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often it is born over the thigh skin, which the ancients called an abulus (a type of surgical suture).
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, you should hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut near its root, then release the wound to run freely or let the blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place over the grounded zygomatic bone or other astringent and scurf-removing powders. (The Latin seems to be somewhat garbled; this could possibly refer to applying a specific type of medicinal powder.)
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If that flesh returns after the healing process, since it often returns, then incise it a second time and burn it; for indeed, this does not return after being cauterized.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Of tooth decay with iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 2anno.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 Whenever they gather on the surfaces of teeth from both interior and exterior parts, and between sharp gums, ugly, and sometimes turn black, and become yellowish, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth are foul because of this.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore, make it sit sick between your hands, and its head in the hollow of your hand, and scrape a molar tooth and a tooth, where you see the cortex appears: until nothing remains from them, and do similarly with blackness, yellowness, greenness, and other things until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 But if that which is at the beginning of them is removed, good; and if not, then again perform curing on those three times a day, secondly, and thirdly, until it finally arrives to what you intend by your study.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that a tooth needs curing tools of various shapes and figures; according to how your operation is prepared: for the tool with which it cuts from the lower part of the tooth is another than that by which it cuts between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of curing tools are prepared for you as those you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Of the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary that you treat a tooth with its own pain with every ability and gradually in removing it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not that which supplies the pain when it is removed: because it is an elevated substance: until there is no excuse for its removal, then when you think of making it sick, you must remove it to strengthen and certify the tooth in pain among you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Many times he deceives himself about the pain of the sick one, thinking that it is because there is a decayed tooth and removing it will reluctantly, the pain does not cease until the weakened tooth is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have now seen this thing from the action of those who perform bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 Thus, when you are sure of the painful tooth itself, then it is necessary that you incise around the tooth with a spatula-like instrument where there is some strength, until the gum is loosened from all sides: afterwards move the same thing with your fingers or with subtle pliers at first gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then those places you should then with large pliers properly located, and the head of the sick person between your fingers: which you have already well held so that it does not move: then pull out the tooth straight ahead so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If however, it does not come out, then take some of those instruments and insert it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did firstly.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If however the toaster is pierced or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and fasten it with a subtle wire at its extremity, so that it does not break in your hour of squeezing on top of it with pliers.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And you should carefully act with incision around the gum from all sides greatly.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And preserve your strength so that you do not break it, and let a part of it remain, and be healed above the sick one from the great harm that caused its initial pain.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And beware that you do not do what the unskilled bloodlettors do in their haste and boldness over removing it, besides administering that which we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 Many times they happen to come upon great weaknesses in people, whose more difficult ones break and all its roots remain, or some of them: or that they extract it with certain bones of the jaw-bone: as we have often witnessed such things.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then it should be washed after its removal with wine, or vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there is a flow of blood from the areas (for this often happens), then take some earth and fill that place with it; and if not, cauterize it if you do not have enough earth.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The forms of the delicate forceps which are used to mold denseness should have long handles, short shanks, thick bodies so that they dore not double when pressed against a tooth: they should be like you see in large jawbones until when you clamp them and they don't snap themselves or fold over; the extremities should be thin and made of iron or properly forged steel with straight ends, and there should be teeth at their extremities that are inserted into some places and maintain an appropriate tension.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And sometimes the tips made like a bird's beak called "ciconia" are strong enough for ties.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Regarding the removal of teeth and the extraction of broken jawbones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When a tooth that has broken remains after removal, then you must place something like butter over the spot for one or two days until it softens; afterwards insert algasti or forceps which have tips similar to a bird's beak called "ciconia".
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 This is how these forceps are shaped.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 Their tips should be made like an inner file, or like "aliskilfegi".
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If therefore the root does not give way to you with these forceps, then it is necessary for you to chisel over the root, and expose all flesh, and insert an instrument called a small palancata, which has this shape: [describe or illustrate the tool's specific shape here if needed].
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 They should have short tips and be quite thick; and not be soaked, lest they break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If therefore the root is removed through this [method], it is good; and if not, one must help with other instruments whose forms are such as these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The shape of the first triangular tip, which has some thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape of the slender triangular tip.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 Also one must help with this instrument having two branches, which is this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools that came before in tooth extraction.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 Also be of aid with this instrument resembling a large hook, which is the form of a curved triangle's tip at its end, which has some thickness, so that it may not break: and let it not be moistened.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many instruments for the teeth: and similarly other instruments are not counted, and a skilled artisan, subtle in his art, found by himself an instrument as it signifies to him the operation and the pains themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 For there are instruments from which the ancients did not speak of a thing, because of the diversity of their kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If however the bone from the jaw breaks or from other facial bacteria or putrefies: then to search over this in its place with that which suits it among instruments and pliers as I said of root extraction, and help with those whose form is such.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Be there somewhat thickening gradually, as it is tightened or held with the bone, and does not flee and goes until the bone comes out: and be restored to place with appropriate medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If however there is a small putrefaction in the bone, then scrap off that putrefaction from itself, and care for it until healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 Concerning the notable door lock on others.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth do not stand out according to their natural course, it is foul by that shape: and especially when this occurs among women, and girls, namely prostitutes.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore, it is necessary for you to consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 For if a tooth has been born after another and it does not stand alone, or its clasping can be done, nor the grinding of itself: then extract it; and if it is attached with another tooth, then cut it off using this instrument, which is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small face, and it is made of sharpened iron, with very sharp edges.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut be such that it is made over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, so that other teeth are not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 But if it is exposed by its own grinding tool: then use a grinder with an iron blade, which has this form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 It is entirely made of iron, and the handle of its sharp points is very sharp, like a grinder with which needles are made: it slowly grinds the tooth over many days with ease, so that the toaster does not move, but falls off: then gently remove it, finally scraping it off with some rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 That if it is a tooth from which a part breaks off and hurts the tongue; then you must also smooth it out until that roughness of the fracture is removed, and leveled: it becomes flat, and does not hurt the tongue, nor corrupts speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Regarding tooth cutting with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When anterior teeth have been knocked out or shaken by percussion or accident; and the patient cannot firmly clench anything over what has been bitten off so that it does not fall out: and after being treated with medicinal astringents, treatment was ineffective: then their nature is such that they should be clamped with gold wire; because silver turns blackish, and decays after some days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let the wire be of medium fineness and thickness according to the amount it can hold between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 Indeed, the form of the incision is such that you should take a thread and insert its double between two healthy teeth; then tear it apart with both ends between the moved teeth, whether there is one or several, until you reach the tissue up to the healthamoingr other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then continue to examine the part from which you incised; and with your hand, be gentle and wise, until it is completely removed: let the constriction of your threading, at the roots of teeth, so that it does not loosen up.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors; and bring them together, and turn them over: then hide them between a healthy tooth and a moved one so that they do not injure the tongue: then let it be tightened until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If however it is loosed or cut, bind them with a thread of another, and let them stand together for such time as whole.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the shape of an incision between two healthy teeth, and between two moved teeth, as you see it.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth are returned to their places after an accident on both sides, and remain as we described, and stay in place: but this is done only by a skilled, wise, and experienced craftsader.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes it is adjusted to a piece of bone from the vagina; and made like the shape of a tooth, and placed in the place where it strengthens and binds a tooth, as we said: and remains, and serves for such a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 Of the incision of the membrane which occurs under the tongue and hinders speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Head 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 Sometimes the membrane which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which man is born, or incidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 And the operation on it is as follows: open up the sickened bone within its head in your hollow, and elevate its tongue; then incise that nerve band across its width until the tongue is released from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there be something of hardness and knotting in it, and if that is from the consolidation of a wound: then insert an arched hook into it, and pierce through its width, until you cut the ligament, and release the knotting.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And be careful that there is no crack deep within the flesh, and cut into this artery, so that a flow of blood may occur.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it should be cleansed with water used for examining wounds, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a compress made of linen under the tongue that holds back the sickness every night: so it may not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 However, if there is a flow of blood, then place over the area some finely ground wool.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if blood conquers you, then burn the area with a spotted caustic iron that suits it: and thereafter care for it as in the remainder of its healing until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 § On the removal of a ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Occasionally it happens under the tongue a sore that resembles a small frog, preventing its natural function from operating: and perhaps it is enlarged so much until it fills up the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 And the operation on it is as follows: open up the sickened bone in its entirety: and regard the sore.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 But if you see it of dusky or black color, hard and which the sick person does not feel: then do not touch it, for it is a tumor.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is declining to whiteness, where there is moisture, then insert an arched hook into it, and cut through its interior with a very fine bandage: and release it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If blood overcomes you during your surgery hour, then place beaten zinc on it until the blood is separated; afterwards return to your surgery and extract the flesh with its dressing.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it shall be washed with vinegar and salt; and care for it according to the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Concerning the treatment of boils on two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 3n. (Note: This is just a
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Sometimes there occur interpharyngeal swellings, that is, glands resembling boils, which appear on the outside; and they are called two tonsils: when you treat them as we have described in division, and do not heal, then consider this.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If the abscess is hard, of dark color, with few sensations: then you should not touch it with a hot iron. (Note: This answer assumes that "fusci" means "dark-colored", which fits within common medical terminology of later medieval Latin texts
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is reddish in color and the root of it is large: then you should not touch it with a hot iron even, fearing an outpouring of blood; rather release it until it matures. (Note: The use of "timens" implies caution due to possible hemorrhage.)
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 And then either you will puncture it or it will rupture by itself. (Note: This suggests a choice between two potential interventions for an abscess, reflecting
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is white in color, round, and its root is thin: then you must cut into it. (Note: The instruction implies a more conservative approach when the abscess appears less threatening.)
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And before your operation consider it as if the abscess has been a quiet warm completeness or decreased somewhat: then you must have the patient sit weakly in front of the sun and his head should be in your lap: and open his mouth and let the servant receive between his hands, and press his tongue downward with an instrument; this is the form. (Note: This instruction outlines a more detailed preparatory procedure involving positioning and assistance from a servant before attempting to incise or treat an abscess.)
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or bronze, that it may be as sharp as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 So then take a hook and fasten it on the boil; afterwards draw as much of it out as you can outside, but avoid pulling any skin with it.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then incise it with an instrument whose form is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles forceps; however, its ends should be rounded off, so that the hole of each is sharply opposite to the other. Therefore it should be made from steel or annealed iron.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	 If this tool is not available, then incise it with a clamp-like object whose form is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 It should be sharp on one side but blunt on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have made an incision in one almond, make another cut in the second following the same pattern of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after making the incision, let a sick person rinse with cold water or vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 But if he experiences a discharge of blood, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegcu have been boiled; or leaves of myrtle and similar stipulative substances, until the flow of blood stops: then care for it until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes other abscesses are born on the throat besides the two almonds.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Then cut them as I said to be done with the incision of the two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 And I myself have already healed a woman from an abscess that had arisen between her throat, which was drawing towards gangrene and causing little sensation because it was almost closing her throat: and the woman could breathe through a narrow passage and she had forbidden herself food intake and drinking water: and she was approaching death, if she remained for one day or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 And the abscess had risen so much that it severed two branches until they emerged above two nasal passages.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 Therefore, I quickly proceeded and fixed one of its hooks into place.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled the flesh out, and a large piece came from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut off that part where I caught it in the nasal passage.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I did what was coming out of the other nasal passage as well.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth and pressed his tongue: then I fixed the hook into the abscess: then I cut off that part of it, and nothing ran out but a small amount of blood: so was the woman's throat freed, and she immediately began to drink water, then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 So I did not stop cutting into that abscess many times over a long period of time: and the abscess kept appearing at the place where I was making cuts until it became too much and with this.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 Therefore, I used my ingenuity, and burned the abscess in between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 So it remained after treatment: then I walked away from there, and did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 On the incision of abscesses for women.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When a catarrh descends into the throat of a woman and becomes an abscess, and it is large: then she herself is called perpendicular. And if it is in the lower part thick, round, then she is called uvula.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is treated as we have mentioned in the division, and no cure is brought about by that: and you see that the abscess has cooled down from it, and become thin: then you must cut into it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And what is attached to it round, and has no length, and is of blood color or brownish or black, and does not have sense: then you must make a cut on that.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 Therefore, there is fear for the sick person in this case.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it according to the method I mentioned from whiteness and its length, make the sick person sit facing the sun: then press their tongue with an instrument, as was previously described. Then fix a hook into it, and pull it downward; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I said in the cutting of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And you must not cut from it anything except what naturally extends beyond without adding to it.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut from there too much, it will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after cutting, use what I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 However, if the sick person is frightened by the cutting: then you must use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and hesitation.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 And there is no method for the cauterization of that, but with sharp water: and it is, as you put your head on your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press their tongue with an instrument I mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take the water I mentioned to you in the chapter of cauterizing and make it with a heated stone that is not burnt: and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill it with the depression made by this instrument, which is its form.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the ends of that be hollowed as a medicine hollows the ears' rays.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 And place the instrument with medicine over that very same tongue: and let the sick person be lying on his side so that he may flow saliva from his mouth due to internal medication, such that nothing falls into his throat from it, and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with medicine in it.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you take from that the first amount equal to half an hour on his tongue, until you see it already darkened and calmed by the biting of medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to receive the whole thing, and wrap it around the extremity of the radius, and pour the ointment with medicine, and insert the rod with the ointment into the tube from above, until the ointcu adheres to the bone above.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do that many times, until you achieve what you want of caulking (i.e., burning) the wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then release it: for she herself dries and falls after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you wish to irrigate the wound with medicine, repeat it as follows: and after caulking cleanse around the wound with ointment soaked in butter, and purify with what is therein from the medicine: and wash with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And it shall be treated externally with camphor, and internally by gargling until healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 Therefore this is the healthier treatment of incision and longer-lasting from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the wound is also treated with what is more subtle than caulking and incision: for it is treated with fomentations, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calamentum, hyssopum, origanum, rutam, sseah, chamomillam, abrotanum, and similar to these herbs: gather all those things or some of them in a pot, and submerge with vinegar, and boil; the pot should be cleaned properly with dirt: there is a hole atop the middle of the pot's opening, upon which an instrument shall be placed according to this method.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Be made of silver or copper: and the end with a pomegranate is inserted into the sickle's mouth until steam rises to the wound above the tube, until it much covers the wound.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat many times over that same one until healed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And cut out the swelling before starting treatment for abscesses.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 It is also pleasing to add in an abscess: it is not necessary to do so unless during the descent of the boil, when it is hot.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 But if this instrument is not present with you, then take a cane and prepare its core at the end: so that the patient's skin may not burn; for the core prevents the steam from burning the skin: and this is part of good treatment for health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 § On removing spines, and bones in the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often it clings to the throat: a fishbone or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore you should extract what appears above that which has fallen: after pressing the tongue with an instrument towards the light, and it is explained to you what is in the throard.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 And that which does not appear to you and hides in the throat, it is necessary for a sick person to vomit before food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 For perhaps something attached will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or a sick person may swallow the end of a pine cone, or the root of lettuce, or a grain of dry bread; or receive the end of sea sponge soaked in milk: and wrap it with woollen thread, then let him swallow the substance.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When therefore it reaches the place where there are bones or a bone, and is extracted, then it goes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If however it does not go out with that which we have said: then use an instrument of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 It should be thicker than a little radius, and at the end there should be flexibility that may easily enter its throat: and it itself has an upwardly polished head.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let it be noted by touch of its epiglottis, that no cough may happen to him: and push the bone or spine or insert it with the doctor's hand itself.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But indeed the sick person inserts it [the catheter], and this is better: because of his own knowledge about the place annexed to the body; and he pushes downward or pulls up with his hand along with the instrument until fully prepared, then exits.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 Concerning the removal of leeches [bloodsuckers].
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When a leech is being treated with what I mentioned in the division of cure along with medicines, and it does not grow [bloodsuck], then consider whether to have its throat examined by daylight in front of the sun, or under the sun after having pressed its tongue with an instrument that you are familiar with.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 But if your intuition falls on the leech, remove it with a small hook or with delicate fingers properly positioned.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 But if it is not possible with them: then take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat up to near the back of the throat; then insert iron heated by fire into the hollowness of the tune.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this many times: and let the patient abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then receive a full utensil of cold water and open his mouth into it: and wash his own mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another by hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For the leech then falls immediately when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 But if it does not exit with what I have said, then fumigate the patient with fleas or with vinegar using an instrument that you are familiar with in the smoking of a woolen garment.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this many times, for it is indeed that it falls.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 And the method of operation in fumigation is that you take a pot where there are green plums with fire; and let the pot be covered with a lid, having an opening in the middle: and insert the end of the instrument into that opening.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then make the person take a suffocation bath and place his sick bone at the tip of the tube, and close his bone so that the suffocation does not escape, until you know that the suffocation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 Immediamo che il sanguisughe cadesse immediatamente.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 Se questo non cade, allora ripeti la suffumigazione molte volte.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 E sopporti il malato sete e mangi pasti salati, aglio e non beva acqua.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Pertanto, è necessario che si esca da questo trattamento.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 Ecco la tecnica con lo strumento per estrarre il sangue della lebbra quando cade sopra l'orecchio stesso. (Si noti che questo si riferisce probabilamo a un metodo descritto nel contesto, non necessariamente alla sanguisuga come animale
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 È simile a un paio di pinzette che vedi: se non è stato inserito in modo tale da entrare nella laringe. (Si nota il riferimento alle forcine utilizzate per attaccare la lebbra al bordo della gola, come descritto nel testo originale.)
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 E la sua estremità è come l'ali di una cicogna che ha un bordo ruvido dove si lega e non lascia mai nulla all'interno. (Si noti il riferimento alle pinzette con le punte ritorte, descritte nel contesto.)
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 § Su come tagliare un ascesso, la sua sezione e trattamento generale. (Si noti che l'apostema qui si riferisce probabilmente ad una raccolta di pus o
Caput XL.	 Testa 40. (Si tratta di numer
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 Esistono molte specie di ascessi, di molti tipi, come la nostra memoria ricorda loro; E sono diversi nei metodi della loro perforazione e nella sezione dei medesimi in due modi: (Il testo qui si riferisce alle varietà di ascessi descritte nel contesto.)
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 Di questi un tipo è una forma specifica di ascesso che deriva dalle umidità: (Si nota il riferimento al tipico crescita dell'ascesso dovuta alla presenza di fluidi corporei in eccesso.)
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 And the second method depends on the places where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since a sore occurrcuing on the head is different from a sore occuring in the anus; and a sore occurrecing at a fleshy place, is different from a sore occurring at joints: each has their own judgement according to its operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from sores are those which should not be perforated unless after the sweating of pus in them and their completion; and among these are those which should be perforated, while they are raw, and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 Like sores that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 For a sore that occurs near a joint and is prolonged to be like its own; until it rots, which may corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint connection: thus it is a closer cause for the contraction of that limb part.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or it is a sore on the main limb part; for if you delay its perforation until it matures, it will harm either that, or through that main limb part.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus; therefore its perforation should be immature: and it should not be perforated, a raw sore, not fully digested, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deep and prolongs to the intestines within, and becomes a fistula, or occurs on its border which cannot heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary for you to know the time of perforation of sores that are matured according to their completion: and it occurs at the easing of pain, reduction of fever, diminishing redness, weakening pulse, and lessening severity of headaches from sores; and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of sores, and more prominent; and let the perforation be descending along the body, if the sores are on parts of hands and feet, limbs' ligaments, nerves, arteries, and ultimately in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those cases that require reflection, proceed with puncturing according to the aforementanguished limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 When an abscess is located in fleshy areas: then it is better to delay the puncturing of that one until its digestion has been confirmed, as we mentioned with regard to suppuration.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 For if you puncture the thing before that: the course of the virus is extended from it, and there are many impurities and discharges, and perhaps its lips harden, and its depths.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are punctured according to the width of the body out of necessity: or according to that which requires it of limb.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary that you administer a slight puncturing in small abscesses, and an ample puncturing in large abscesses: or many sections according to the similarity of the size of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And there are from abscesses, in which it is necessary that the skin be chiseled away: and when it has been cut like cloth, and done up on its edge, which already has died: as that happens in many, where it becomes soft, and swellings.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And there are from them that have sections with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And there is one of which it becomes like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an abscess in the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And there are from them that a round puncturing is administered, and a crescent-shaped one: and similar to those of the sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 However, that which does not have a head, such as shallow abscesseras, it is necessary to puncture with a surface puncturing, or merely flat ones.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 And it is necessary that when an abscess is large and has already collected many healings, and you have punctured its contents, so that you do not withdraw all the pus at once during that time: indeed extract from that very part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then [let] a soft lump from an abscess persist for another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then let something be drawn out of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do that many times gradually, until it is expelled out: especially if the patient is weak due to lack of strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man with gray hair: for often the spirit of the living animal is resolved by the passing away from the sickness. And perhaps the weak person dies and you do not notice it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Therefore take this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 And after your incision, which you make in such abscesses, it should be cleaned to prevent wound; and consider this.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If therefore there is a small wound from an abscess, or it is a flat incision, then apply Licinius' liniment, or the ancient lotion of Cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 And if it is a large abscess, and there are many fissures from the incision, then let you insert Licinium into every fissure until they reach closure.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 And if in the abscess you have detached part of the skin or pushed it around its edge: then let you fill it with the old Cotton, or as when a cloth is woven, or when lint is carded without moisture: and bind that firmly until on the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then lay it out, and treat it with what you need from an ointnent, until healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 But if however a flow of blood happens during your time of operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked into the cloths: and place it many times over the place of the blood flow.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 But if the blood flow persists, then it is necessary to administer a regime and treatment, and powders as described in many places of this book, and division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 However, if it is during the winter season and the location of the swelling involves many nerves: then one should pour warm vinegar and hot oil into droplets and place them on top of that spot.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is during the summer and the areas are fleshy: then one should place droplets soaked in water, oil, or a mixture of wine and oil, and all that cold substance.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we said, then one should dissolve the swelling and cleanse the wound, and administer to its healing whatever is suitable for it, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 This therefore is what is necessary from knowledge of universal treatment for swelling.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the aforementioned method of classification, I have already said about every kind of swelling, how it is directed towards its healing chapter by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Of cutting out swelling that occurs on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Head XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	 Swellings on the skin of the head are small and belong to the species of Nodules, which consist of sacs that contain them like little bags of hens' nests.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And there are many kinds of these species.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to mud; and some contain moisture similar to scales and scabs; there are others like that, and among them are ones that are stone-hard.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And during the surgery on all of them, there is no fear for their extraction as long as it does not cause disruption to the blood vessels in its cutting process.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 And the operation during their extraction is to try them with an instrument whose shape comes after these, which is called an Intrusion, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then dry the extracted part by cutting along its length following the method of the surface cut: according to this shape.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 And begin with the cutting from line b to line g; therefore, as moisture is evacuated, then remove the growth that contains this moisture, and do not let anything be left in it thoroughly.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For often times it returns if something remains from there.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the cautery in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt; then fill with it the wound, and let it remain until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For indeed it consumes what remains from the growth.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat over the cautery with Egyptian ointment a second and third time; and if you see that it has not left anything from the growth, then care for the wound with ointment until healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the abscess contains a pus node: then dry it following this form; having the shape of a cross for cutting: and project the little hooks between the bone ends, and remove it from all parts: and try your skill in extracting the envelope that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 But if however an obstruction is made for you by the vessel, then do what I will tell you to do afterward.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly proceed with an abscess if it is a stone: by cutting and the same care as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 And the cutting over the abscess of a stone is easier: because there are few blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes these types of abscesses are located on the head of some men, with whom there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 That is: because I have cut over an abscess on the head of a bald woman, and found an abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if it were struck with something being thrown at it by someone else, it would wound itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 In other cases of boils and such occurrences on the head, besides these apostemas that occur in children' cups, and near the roots of ears, a superficial section should be performed for all of them.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or place a puncture on their always from the lower part of them, so that the course of pus may be relieved towards the bottom.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then attend to it with what suits them in accordance with its treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 § On cutting of Strophulae on the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Head XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 Often these boils occur on the neck and under arms, and groins, and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And on top of these that occur on the neck, there are few and many: and they originate from sweat; and all Strophulae come from them within their own tunic, just as it is in nodes and boils of the head, as I have told you.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And there are many kinds of these Strophulae.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For from them indeed there are stones; and there are those that contain moisture; and there are harmful ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In this kind then that you see of good arrangement by touch, which is evident by the close color of skin, and it moves to all parts, and it is not joined with collar nerves, nor with jugular veins, nor with arteries, nor deep: one must cut it off with a superficial section from upper part downward toward lower part of body along line b. to line g., and pick out its skin edge by edging all around; or extend two lips of skin with hooks or many hooks if you find such thing as we said in head boils, and gradually extract it.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is to be observed carefully not to injure the vein, nor nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 And it is a place not very sharp: so that it does not give you hand pain when making an incision, or trouble the sick person, and cut only what is necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 However, if you fall and injure an artery or the wound is closed off from surgery, then place ground zigaretto (incense) or certain powders that stop blood flow into the wound, tighten the wound, and release it, until the swelling of pus subsides and the wound softens; or if it begins to start turning putrid.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 Therefore, blood is stopped using a tourniquet from Robertus, so that you may finish your surgery.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then examine with your index finger if anything remains from the staples or other materials: so cut them out and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If there is a large opening in the root of the staple: then it must not be cut from its own roots: rather it should be lightly loosested with a double strong thread and released so that it falls off on its own without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound completely with an old ointnent of Egypt which you have already submerged.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of it. (Note: This instruction is
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the entire staple is cut, then it must be gathered with two wound lips: and wash it immediately after seeing that nothing remains overabundant. (Note: This instruction assumes familiarity with ancient surgical procedures involving staples.)
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 However, if you see that there remains an overabundance because of the size of the stapletechnology, then it must be tightened to cut its roots and extract it: and apply the suture as we mentioned before. (Note: This instruction assumes knowledge of historical surgical techniques involving sutures.)
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And what contains moisture from the staple should be punctured with a superficial perforation so that its healing place appears to you: and place the perforation below where it follows on the body as we said. (Note: This instruction assumes knowledge of historical surgical practices involving the management of wound moisture.)
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer liniment with ointment, and similar substances, to warm what remains from the decay until when you see that the wound is already cleaned: then take care of it with a regenerating ointment for the flesh, until it heals. (Note: This instruction assumes knowledge of historical surgical practices involving post-perforation treatments.)
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 § On cutting the epiglottis due to an obstruction within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients have said that this incision was made on the epiglaturm, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is their writing style.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 However, in those with a tension pneumothorax, it is necessary that an incision be made on the epiglottis; because if this does not occur, then respiration cannot take place: therefore, because all vessels and lungs are sick.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 In those who have a hot abscess in the mouth or throat, or in both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the canal, it should be used to make an incision on the epiglottis, to avoid destruction that occurs from perforation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we wish to do that incision on the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis, a small cut perpendicular in width, between two circles for as much quantity as there is an incision in flesh and not cartilage: this place itself is suitable for cutting because it is devoid of fatty tissue, and vessels of blood are far from that area.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 But if the physician is hesitant, then they should stretch out the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then strike the skin until it reaches the canal; let out some blood vessels if you see anything coming from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut the flesh as we have mentioned; and it signifies above the cutting of the canal from mucus that emerges from there, when something breaks off, and a cough is expelled.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And release an open wound after some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 But when the hour is removed from which he fears perforation, bring together two lips of a skin wound and its own alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow; until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Said Albuccian.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 The sum of the tale we have told is not an explanation unless when they see that some of these boils have already closed up in the patient's throat: and the sick man rises above death, and wishes to cut off his breathing; so they come to cutting out the epiglottis, as for him to breathe upon the wound site, and is healed from death: and therefore it was prescribed to let open sores be removed until the malice of the sickness consumes completely, and its malevolence lasts three days or so; then they ordered to sew up the wound, and take care of it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And what I have seen myself is that a maid took hold of a knife and thrust it into her own throat, and wounded herself with its edge.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to heal hers, and found her moaning as the cry of the dead is.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 Therefore from the wound I dissected it, and found blood that had come out through the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 Therefore I was confused because she did not faint nor vomit: and a breath of air came out from the ward.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 So I cared for the wound and treated it until healed; and nothing befell to the maid except a rasping voice: and she returned after days to better condition of her own.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 Therefore I say: that there is no fear in cutting out an epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 ¶ On the incision of a hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This hernia of the throat called 'Aposthoma' is a large boil according to the body's color: and it occurs frequently among women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 And it is in two ways: for it may be natural or accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 Certainerly, it cannot be an artifice naturally.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 However, in the other way accidental, there are two kinds: one is like a node of pine cones.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And another kind is like an embolism that occurs due to vascatury.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 And in it is fear, and one should not make a conjecture about this with iron unless in what is small; and you test the thing yourself, and investigate it by insertion.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If therefore you find it like a node of pine cones and is not hanging with any vessels: then cut out the thing as they do nodes: and extract it along with whatever contains from the sack, if it is in the sack; and if not, then examine its entirety.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to the place as required for healing until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 ¶ On cutting according to types of nodes. (This is not a translation instruction but part of the original text or
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already described all the kinds thereof in division: and it is necessary that I narrate herein a distinction between Node, and Embolism: since it creates doubt. (This text snippet doesn't contain instructions but rather appears to be part of an original work.)
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 Therefore I say that when an Embolism is heat and fever and intense pains until the overflow of excess fluid subsides and putrefaction completes: then indeed the fevers calm down, and warmth subsides. (Again, this appears to be part of a larger work.)
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 However when a Node is not heat nor fever nor pains, and it contains those sacs called siphachae, which are their own sacs according to the color of the body: and they arise suddenly like beans, and come forth like fennel, bigger and smaller ones. (Once more, part of a larger document.)
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And there are two kinds: fatty or containing moisture. (This is also not an instruction but text from the original work.)
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And there are many colors due to moisture, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of the Node, you must examine it and ask about its form first with the instrument called Intromissum, as described in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the method of inquiring about swellings and all nodes is to receive this instrument, insert it into a wetter place you find in the swelling: and gradually retract your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then use your last finger according to the size of the swellings.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Next, remove the Intromebium and examine what comes out on its indication.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If then there runs a moisture, whatever the color is: then dry it with a cut that is superfebrile, as I said in other swellings.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if there does not come out moisture in the indication of Intromissum, then know it is fatty: therefore dry above it with a cut that has a cross shape, according to this form as I taught you: and hang it with an unguentarium, and excoriate the skin from all sides easily: and if you can keep something on top of that, guard it with a kestros, so as to extract the healthy Node.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If however the unguentarium is broken during surgery, and it is not possible to extract it fully, because this often happens with that: then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 For if something still remains from it a little or much, the Node returns greatly.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if it overcomes you and a little still remains from it: then fill the wound near your completion with some sharp abrasive powders: and bind the wound, and place on top of that which sits in hot swelling, and care for it as per the remaining treatment until healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If there is a large knot, then tie its two lips and care for it as it becomes inflamed.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 But if the blood vessel is pulsing or not: then hurry, and fill in the place with a pounded lint, and release it tightly for two days or three, until the wound putrefies and the boiling of blood ceases: then return to cutting off what remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 § Of external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 There are forms of probes; and they are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 For from them there is a large one, and from them there is a medium one, and from them there is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Let them be made of iron rectangular ends askew, so that they enter quickly into the extremities.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these are forms of experients (probes), and not piercers; that is, perforators: and one of their names is called a berr, that is, a perforator: and they are three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 For from them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They are fitted to be used for investigating through the extremities, and excised tissues, and fistulas, and boils arising between them from bone fragments.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And they are also made round, pointed, and blunt, as with large needles that follow the seats (beds), such as from amber indeed, or from copper, iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 And their better ones are those made of amber.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And they are also made of black lead and used for investigating the fistulas whose refluxes (outflows) are mirror-like, which with their own smoothness cause reflection in harmony with those refluxe.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 And again they are three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 For from them there are long ones, and medium ones, and short ones, according to the amplitude of the fistulas and stricture (narrowing) it has.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The shape of cuts, and there are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Since they are simple ones, namely those with a single passage: and there are three kinds as you see them - Great, Middle, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And among them are blind cuts, and there are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And among them are hooks with two passages and there are three kinds; and those are hooks with three passages and there are three kinds as well; and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the shapes of scalpels by which nodes and boils are cut and scraped; and there are three kinds - Great, Medium, and Small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 Their pointed ends are those with which cutting is done; the other ends are not sharp. And they do not have such shapes, unless for providing comfort during boil scraping when there is fear of a cut on the vein or nerve, and that it may be healed through them in cases where only slight burning was found to provide relief at the time of nodule scrapeing.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are hooks with three passages, and there are three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of iron, and they resemble an earthenware pipe with which alcohol is drawn; there is a small hole at the wider end hidden by Spatulae (surgical spreaders); and into it flows towards the interior or exterior depending on whether it's used as seen.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of the spreaders hidden between fingers during boil puncturing; and they are not felt by patients: and there are three kinds - Great, Medium, and Small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The form of the blood vessel cutters with which bleeding flow is severed; and there are three kinds - Great, Medium, and Small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 They should be made of copper or gold, round mostly in length as seen; and they are subtle.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 And it should be that there are these types of tourniquets with you, large and small; so as to use them for cutting off blood quickly when necessary, and then when no medicine is present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them for cutting off blood in every body part; and only use them on fleshly places: such as the shanks of legs, hips, arms' shoulders, breasts, winds, groins, and similar to these from fleshy parts, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes tools are made from them similar to cups of fistulae; which cuts off blood when it flows out of a wound or during an incision of veins, arteries: and at times there are made from them spherical ones according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 § On the healing of human breasts which resemble women's breasts.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Sometimes breasts of some people are inflamed during the completion of sleep (that is, when they start to become sweaty during sleep): and remain with unsightly pustules.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 But if one dislikes this, he should cut over the breasts using a crescent-shaped incision according to this method from point b, to point g: then remove all the swelling.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with carnivorous medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And then gather two lips of the wound together with a stitch: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if it bends downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it should be cut in two of its upper sides at the same shape of a crescent-shaped incision, one of which contains the other on each side until the larger line encloses the smaller according to this method from point b, to point g. Then remove the skin that is between the two lips and take away the swelling, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 However, if you cannot close the incision as it should be cut due to the patient'amoor or because of bleeding: then you must fill the wound with soaked cotton in a corrosive ointment and let it rest until that which remains from the swelling dries.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 Regarding the puncture of abscesses that occurs under a boil.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under a boil are of the species called Strophulae, which contain bile and consist of them, and they are those containing moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 These therefore that contain moisture should be dried out with a crescent-shaped incision according to this pattern, from line b to line g, so that all the pus in the abscess is drained because of the discharge, then fill it with old cotton and let it rest until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the cotton, and care for it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the abscess is of the species called Nodes of Strophulae, then cut over it as we have said in the incision above the Strophulae equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 However, if the wound extends to such an extent that it discharges pus, then apply a caustic agent there as we have said in what was mentioned earlier.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Regarding the incision of abscessamoor that occurs due to an artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery is ruptured and the skin that is over it hardens, this often leads to abscesses from there: similarly, with veins as well, such things happen with abscesses and swelling.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which one knows that abscesses and swelling are due to an artery and a vein are as follows: for when an abscess is because of an artery, it is long, clustered deep in the body; and when you push on an abscess with your fingers, you feel almost like there's a hissing sound.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And what is related to veins is round within the open body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And a section over this abscess is an error, especially when it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many body places; and it is very large indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its care must be directed with iron, and what is also from it in the extremities or head should be treated accordingly.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Over this therefore from them arises due to an inflammamoent of the Artery's opening, it is found with a cut lengthwise into the skin.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open with hooks, afterwards the artery itself; and free it from the tunics until revealed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then introduce under it a hook and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the artery with a thread twice at two places, as I taught you in extracting the two arteries that are on the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then strike the place between the two ligaments with a pincers until all blood that is within it flows out and the abscess dissolves.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall; afterwards care for it with suitable ointments to that end when healed.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If the abscess is from a vein incision, then it must be held by your hand as much as possible away with skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a hook under the place you have held with your hand and make it penetrate; and be there a thread twice until extracted from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then bind with the very abscess itself a good ligament: as I told you on the vein of two parts with two extremities thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 But if the thread that is extracted a hook, then insert another with another thread under the abscess entirely at the incision of the needle: press and bind your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then he cauterizes the abscess in its center until it protrudes; then incise the excess skin, and remove what is tied there.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place on top of that swelling which you have immersed in wine, and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer the treatment with licorice and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 § About an abscess that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	 Head L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As it happens with an abscess in the Artery and Vein, similarly occurs with an abspect in Nerves: what happens to them is a blow, or from excessive labor, and similar causes: and they happen much more often at places of assistance, or heels, and in every place where they move joints: and it is a grave abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 It resembles the color of other parts of the body, and it is found without pain in various dispositions: and when it tightens with great force, it feels weak like a state of stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And it is not an abscess accumulated deep within the body; rather, it is under the skin and moves to all parts of it without advancing forward or backward.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 Therefore, when occurring at joints, one does not need it to advance with iron (scalpel).
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps there is a contraction.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 However, that which occurs at the head or forehead, has skin with pus-like substance.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If it is an abscess of glands, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape off the abscess; next remove the piece, and bind the wound with stitches: and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 § About cutting an abscess that occurs at the genitalia.
Caput LI.	 Head LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 Certain very men often suffer from afflictions in their sinews and in other parts of their bodies, called thrushes, which are similar to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 The root is thin, the head is thick, and they turn over the lips of those who have them.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 And there are two kinds among them: one that is greatly esteemed.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And I myself have already seen men who had two thrushes that were more like other fungi: there was no difference between them; they were white and minute at the root, and turned over their lips, burst open, and always released moisture from within.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 Therefore, I have cut into them, and found that one weighed about X pounds and VIII unciae (ounces), and the other VI unciae; thus consider: if the patient is moist and the thrushes are white, thin at the root, then you should incise it with a rather wide spatula, while there is caution in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For often much blood is expelled during its sectioning; so be quick if your own blood overcomes you, then burn it with caution.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see a patient who is cowardly and timid from the incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead properly formed, and tie it around the thrushes; as we have said before, let go of them after two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add to the lead string. (Note: The translation is complete, but this sentence seems incomplete or out of context
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease to hold the lead string whenever it imprints on thrushes, until it separates and falls off naturally without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 However, if there are thrushein large at the root, then there is something of fear and cowardice during its incision: especially because it's located inside a vein. (Note: The context may suggest that the size or location increases the difficulty or danger of treatment)
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 However, it is possible to sever half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize its body so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And be careful not to assume you are cutting something that is of a darker color, with few sensations and unpleasant appearance: for it is indeed an abscessed cancerous tumor; and I remember the treatment given by Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Regarding the treatment of enlargements at the navel.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 The enlargement at the navel is due to many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or from fissures of the diaphrage, which is above the abdomen: and it comes out as a result of this through wind or bowels, just as happens with other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or from blood that flows from the vein, or from the artery, as previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or from wind being trapped there.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If however it is due to a diaphragmatic rupture and wind discharge: then it has the color similar to that of the body: and it is bloody without pain: and appears in various places.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 And if it is due to bowel discharge, then the location of its release is more intense in variety as we have narrated.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When therefore you press it with your fingers, it hides: then it returns and there may be a sound associated with it: and it is greatly magnified at the bath entrance, causing painful swelling.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 If however it is due to moisture, then it is bloody and does not hide when pressed with your hand, nor tighten or swell.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If however it is due to blood, then these signs appear as an abscess turning black at the edge.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 And if however it is due to new flesh: then it is a serious abscess, large and hard, growing according to the amount of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If indeed it is due to windiness, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation on that is such that then you must consider if there is prominence of the navel due to artery blood, or vein, or windiness; then it should be avoided from healing.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and trembling, as I taught you in the chapter where I said stasis due to an artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 But if there is prominence of the navel due to the bowels or wind: then one should instruct the sick person to keep their breathing steady and stand upright extendedly.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then signs with warm wax around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Afterwards instruct it to lie between your hands over its back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then surround with a wide bandage around the navel above the place where you marked it with hot wax.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend medium stasis upwardly, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind it around the navel with a strong thread or string from silk cord and make knots at the end of the tensioned ligament.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open up the extended stasis above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 But if you find it already detached from the ligament: then extract the stasis and insert into the index finger, and push the intestine towards the interior of the bowels: and if you encounter wind, then take the content with a large hook, and cut away any excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 But if it is opposite to you an artery or vein: then surround that much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then come back to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert into them two strong threads: and insert two neede
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then bind the stasis at four places over the needles: and if you can, remove the needle, and leave the place until the extended flesh rots away: and it falls off by itself: or cut out when softened and rotted.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what is needed using ointments until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the prominence of the navel is from a flesh wound or moisture: then it should be cauterized as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And extract any blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then care for it with what is needed to strengthen the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 On treating cancer.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII. (Latin III = three, so
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 Now we have mentioned the division of cancer types and how to treat them with medicines; also it should be treated from there using iron so that it does not ulcerate; and we have discussed cancers originating in the uterus, and the precautions for tren.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 And the ancients have said that sometimes cancer is located where it can be completely removed: such as cancer in the nipples or thighs and similar cases, from body parts to be extracted entirely; especially when small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it is large and has been eradicated, one should not approach close to it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I have not been able to cure any of them: nor have I seen anyone before me who has come to that.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when located as we have mentioned, is to precede and dissolve weakness by means of a black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then use leeches if you find them with obvious swelling.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the patient for treatment, where it is located with surgery.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then throw out the hooks that are attached to it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then cauterize it from all sides with a scalpel, according to examination until nothing remains of its roots; and let the blood flow out, and do not cut it quickly, rather press on spots, and cleanse away thick blood completely by hand or as much as possible there with tools.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 However, if bleeding prevents you due to a swoleblood from an incision of the artery or vein, then cauterize the vein until the blood separates.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the remaining treatment until healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 Regarding the treatment for Hydrops.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 Now we have narrated the division of Hydrops and how water accumulamoins form; and signs of every type, as well as its treatment with drugs.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 And those that are treated with iron are only of the type ascites alone; and they do not approach types of tympanitis nor hyposarcia completely, for these are deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have already treated this type of tympanitis with drugs and the treatment has not succeeded: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if weakness has already settled in him or there is another ailment besides Hydrops, such as coughing or sputum dissolution and similar conditions: then do not treat with iron, for that fear exists.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 But if you see a patient with an excess of strength and there is no other illness besides Hydrops alone: and it is neither a boy nor an old person: then the method of operation in him is, as you elevate the patient standing between your hands, and have someone behind them express their phlegm by thrusting water onto the lower part of their chest with his hand.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a large thorn, as follows this shape: (Here you would describe how to prepare and use the 'large thwart' in context).
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it have two sharp parts, be long and with pointed tips like Thwart (This is an instruction about forming a tool similar to the 'thwart' described previously).
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, ensure it has some gradual width in it so that you do not penetrate too deeply during the operation until the intestines and injure him.
Deinde considera.	 Then carefully examine.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 If the hydropisis generation is from a part of the intestines, then it should be extended with an incision at the navel to a length equaling three digits and directed downwards above the sternum.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 However, if the hydropisis generation is due to liver illness: then your incision on the left should be from the navel measuring three digits.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if that generation is due to the spleen: then your incision on the right side should be made: and it does not even need an incision above which the patient wishes to lie weak, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Then pierce with a tool through all skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert into that incision and moisten your hand with spatulilin between skin, and spread; as if you were scrape it off: and the amount that should be scraped is an amount of a fingernail, or about so much.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then pierce with spatulilin until it reaches the vacuum space; and that is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then extract it, and insert into the opening an instrument of this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 And it is like cannulas: made of silver or iron or copper, smooth and thin: on its lower part there are two holes, and on its sides there are three holes, two from one side, and one from the other; and its tip end is cut as you see in the incision model, like a pen's nib: at its upper extremity there is an armlet.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches water, it immediately descends on top of the instrument; therefore purify half an hour'vee amount from water.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 For if you purify too much from it within an hour, perhaps the patient will die through a dissolution of his own body's spirits; or he has a fainting which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 Indeed, I will use it according to the quantity of its potency, and as you instruct regarding the dispositions of sickness from its potency, and by its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then extract the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it is retained immediately due to the skin that retains the hole that is above the shaft; as you described, puncture it according to this method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat with a different instrument if you see the patient can endure that; and also extract a small amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Do this for several days without fear, and protect yourself from error: until there is very little left in the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If however you have applied it to the sick person several times, and removed much from water; then care for him with a warm sand bath and profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and wait over thirst: and care for him with purgative medicines until he is cured: and burn (the potion) on the stomach, liver, and spleen, after extracting water; as you described what was done before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 About caring for infants born in places where their urine is not pierced.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When someone is born from the womb of a mother and his head is not pierced, or it has a tight hole, or it is located elsewhere than its usual place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, one must intervene immediately at birth with a very fine sponge bath according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a very fine instrument made of lead in the nostrils and tie it off; and hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 Whenever he wishes to pass urine, remove (the instruments) and let him drink.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then reduce the swelling.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you cannot use lead now, it is also possible that the urine flowing over the spot does not allow closure of it.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 However, if the opening is tight, it should be treated with lead, as we have said, over many days until it is enlargamo.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 But those in which there is an opening not in its proper place are damaged.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 Because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the female body part, so it cannot penetrate towards the front until it has moved itself upwards by hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 Nor is there generation for this reason, because semen cannot reach the womb in straightness; and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of procedure in that case is to lie down the sick person on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend with your left hand the head of that female body part with a vigorous stretching and cut at the top of the male head from its place of protrusion, sharply or slightly acutely; as is incision of reed, or as you have split something in half, so that it comes out like the middle of the head of the female body part: and let the opening fall to the center according to what ought.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And take care with your operation from bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Oftentnises it happens so.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore apply to him what he has cut with blood and treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 § Concerning what happens to the foreskin and head of the female body part, and decay, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	 Chapter 66.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Oftnies these things happen to the female body part, and it is a prominent foulness of flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And one other thing is very bad, and another not very bad.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Not therefore the non-very-bad must be held with a slender hook, and cut it off until you have removed all of it.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place over it a pad soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it afterward with dafinion ointment until healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If the tumor is malignant and discolored, then you must apply cautery after its incision and cutting.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 However, if the albater is within the foreskin of a captus who has not been circumcuted and it is part Albather between the foreskin and outside: then you must remove Albather first inside, until consolidated, then care for it from the outside; because when you cure them at once, there will be no precaution so that the foreskin does not become foreshortened.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And now also occur in the testicles and blackness of the foreskin and decay.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you must cauterize all that has turned black and what you wish to be decayed or already is decaying.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then a line on top of it afterward with honey that has been mixed with ground-up meal and pounded herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that with the remaining treatment until healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 But if there is a bleeding flow, then you must apply cautery with moon-cauter, according to this method.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 For the cautery is a remedy for both conditions at once, namely bleeding and wounds when they are corrupting.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of a woman is corroded and destroyed all at once: then you must insert into the man's urethra a tube made of lead, so that the sick person may drip over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 However, if there is adhesion of the foreskin with the head of a woman, and indeed this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy, and it does not require super circumcision: and sometimes it occurs because of wounds or abscesses; you must therefore remove that with an obtuse spatulum until the ligament dissolves, and releases the head of a woman from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish them clearly, then one must shave off something from the maiden'ader and the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Because when the prepuce is delicate, it may be pierced due to its own subtlety quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin and the head of the maiden with a fine linen cloth that has already been made wet with cold water so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it should be treated with astringent wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Regarding the cleanliness of infants and treatment due to accidents.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not the solution to continence, as are other wounds: however, since it comes from our work, our will, and its use being proper for boys, we must mark this operation as better, and a lighter way leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 Therefore, I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books: since they do not use them according to laws and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 Because I have found a greater part of the art to use phlebotomists for cleanliness, circumcision with scissors and forceps: they are used as well by those who bind tightly with thread, and cut with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 And I myself have already tested all those methods, and I have not found a better cleansing with forceps and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 For cleanlineby using scissors, the skin often flees.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 For the prepuce has two layers of skin: therefore perhaps the upper skin is pierced and the lower layer remains; it is thought that there should be a cut to injure one of them and cause pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with cleanliness that is done by binding tightly, that is, with fingers, which surgeons use, there is no secure incision of the extremities of the male member: because perhaps it enters into its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However, in the cleansing of a nail, perhaps iron is used, and it spoils your operation; indeed, the skin of young boys is naturally thin, and they are often born this way so that no cleansing is needed; I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 However, in the cleansing of a nail and with a string tied to it, I have successfully conducted an experiment: since the forceps are proportional to the incision, therefore the sharpness that is above is like the sharpnss below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 Thus, when you raise your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportional, and they incise according to a single operation at one time; it forms a compression of similar shape, containing the skin of the girl from all sides, so that no mistake whatsoever occurs.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the mode of your operation is to make it extendable, especially for boys if they are from those who understand little, which you do not do unless you tie a string on their skin only; and you let them go until the next day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him enjoy and rejoice in every possible way for himself; because he receives understanding from it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand between your prepared hands according to his stature, and not be seated; and hidden forceps on your sleeve or under your foot so that the boy does not see them at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into her thigh and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the girl's vagina is out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse that part with what accumulates therein dirty.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place twice with a string.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Afterward, tie the lower part of the ligament to that extent as well.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold it with your index finger, and your thumb retains the lower part of the ligament firmly, and incise between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then lift the skin quickly upwards and remove the thorny branchlet.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow gradually (for it is better so) and place powder from above: and on top of the pownser put linen in which an incubated quail egg has been boiled in rose water, mixed with freshly pressed oil of roses; and lay it over until another day arrivebut care for the rest of the treatment as long as it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 However, this is how to cleanse using forceps:
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 There are two blunt ends and they fit together: do not push the branch out; and the length of both sharp parts should be equal to the length of both handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 However, an error that may occur during cleanscuing is: since the skin's inner part might entirely escape or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, as you stretch it out from your time with your nail before locating the area: and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it using a hook, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 However, if three days have passed and there remains what is under the inflamed branchlet, an abscess: then let it rest until the abscess becomes warm, and scrape it off easily, and cut as you prepared for yourself: and cover it from the head of the branchlet with a dressing.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 For he will not be harmed by that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore, take care of that with what consolidates a wound from powders, which we have discussed in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut above its measure, and evades to the higher parts, it will not harm him even so.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, take care of that with what we have discussed, until healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Regarding the removal of a retained bladder stone:
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Chapter 58. Retention of urine in the bladamo, is achieved by making a stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or raw meat, and similar things from those we mentioned by methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if it is not relieved and you see that the urine retention is due to a stone already present in the bladder neck: then he should be made weak over his own knees, lying down.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then his feet are placed on his back and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back, and squeezes inhales as much as possible by him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore, when a stone is thought to be expelled from the bladder neck towards the back: that's why it relieves urine retention.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 But if it is not relieved with what we have said and he feels discomfort over the weakened one: then you should administer its extraction by means of an instrument, called a syringe, whose this is the shape It is made of silver, and it is delicate, smooth, hollow as the quill pen's shaft in subtlety: long like the width of one palm; there must be a fine cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 And the method of exiting urine by it is as follows: receive a doubled thread at its end and tie with linen or cotton, good ligature; insert the extremity of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; cut with scissors if there's any excess from the thread, truly insert into the cannula forcefully, as you tighten.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then clean the syringe with oil or butter, and albugine: and make him sit over a stool, and insert into the bladder neck, and wet his urethra with moistened oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then insert a syringe into the vagina with ease, until it reaches the root of the vagina.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then take two more on top from the upper part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then insert the syringe into it until it reaches the bladcu; and feel if the patient has already reached an empty space: but this is not done according to this order unless the channel, through which it passes, is twisted as such.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 The vagina will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then remove it and make the vagina run through the channel of urine; and repeat the syringe, and do not stop doing that until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Regarding the quality of cleansing the bladder with a Clepsydra. (Note: In an actual translation task for historical texts, understanding context is crucial; "Clepsydra
Caput LIX.	 Head LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When an ulcer occurs in the bladder or blood congeals within it, or pus is blocked inside of it; then a device called Clepshydra is made with instruments as follows:
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is indeed closed, that is to say, sealed. (Note: "surda" in Latin can mean "de
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And there are three holes in it, two from one part and one from the other side, as you see. (Note: This translation assumes that "sicut" is meant to be a Latin equivalent of "as follows," which may not be contextually accurate but serves for this exercise.)
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the place where this is pushed should be according to the quantity that suits it without addition until when something is drawn out with it from moistures; and when it's driven, it expels it over a distance: just as clepshydra does, which throws off naptha, that is Greek fire in warfare. (Note: "id est" means "that is," indicating further explanation or clarification.)
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore, when you want to throw out the fluids into a bag, insert the tip of the siphon into the fluid, and pull along with what propels it upward, for the fluid is drawn into the concavity of the siphon.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its tip into the wound as we described with the catheter.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the fluid along with what is being pushed so that the fluid immediately reaches the bag, as if felt by the patient.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The form of a subtle clyster to cleanse the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Be made of silver or gold: its head should be high like a small jug and under it there should be an interval where the sling can hang.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and place fluid in it, which is to cleanse the bladnary bag with the clyster.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie it between two intervals of strong thread and heat that fluid a little above fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the tip of the clyster into the wound and then tighten your hand over the bladder with fluid in a decent knot until the patient feels it, as that fluid has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 But if it is not present to you a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert strong thread into those holes as they open up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather the circle like it is gathered with alms: after you put what you need from that which is made of fluids, and oil, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie that circle on the instrument as you did with the bladder from an expression using your hand, until the fluid reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 § Regarding the extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	 Chapter 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 Now we have discussed the division of species Lapidis, and its treatment with medicines; and I mentioned the difference between the Stone generated in the kidneys, and blad etherium, and the signs thereof: and I mentioned the Stone where surgical operation falls by hand and cutting. And it is a Stone generated specifically in the bladder, and that one which becomes fixed in the urethra; and this is what I am telling with clear exposure and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that a Stone generated specifically in the bladder happens very often to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And one of its signs is that urine exits from the bladder like water with its subtlety: and appears in it white sand, and the weakened boy rubs his urethra, and labors with it, and often he droops.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it is raised up, and comes out along with him having many of them. (referring to urinary stones)
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of boys is easy up to where they have reached fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	 And it is difficult for the elderly. (referring to urinary stones)
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 For boys it is moderate, being between the two; and for those whose Stone is larger, the cure is easier: and if smaller, there's a reverse in that care. (referring to urinary stones)
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 And thus when we arrive at treatment, it is primarily that we cleanse the infirm with an enema, to let out all feces that are within his bowels; because sometimes it prevents a Stone from appearing during examination. (referring to urinary stones)
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the patient is taken with his legs raised up and moved towards downwards; so that the Stone descends to the depths of the blad etherium or leaps from a high place several times. (referring to urinary stones)
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under his coccyx, so that the bladder is fully moved towards downwards. (referring to urinary stones)
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine him and touch him from the outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 Therefore, if you feel a stone inside, act quickly with an incision above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall at all to your touch, then you should wash the index finger with olive oil from the left hand if he is a sick boy; or the middle finger if he is a fully grown youth: and insert it into his anus, examine for the stone while under your finger: and slowly turn it towards the navel.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press on it with your finger and push the stone towards the outside against its location; instruct a servant to squeeze his scrotum with their hand and instruct another servant to stretch the testicles upwards with their right hand: and with their other hand, remove any skin that is under the testicles near where the incision was made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then insert a drainage tube whose shape is as follows.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 And find it between the anus and testicles, but not in the middle, on the left side of the scrotum: and make sure the incision is above the stone, with your finger inside the anus; and ensure a crosswise incision that is wider externally and tighter internally, according to as much egress of the stone from there is possible without being too large.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 For perhaps by compressing the finger that is inside the anamen near the incision, the stone comes out easily.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are angles and edges, which is why its exit is difficult due to this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And from it is a soft substance, similar to a glandular tissue, and round: and therefore its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 Therefore, since it has angles and edges, insert it into the crevice.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out this way, then you should apply leverage on top of it; or place strings over it with a proper arrangement such that their ends are like the moon cradling the stone and do not move away from it: or insert a delicate instrument underneath it with curved tips.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If however you cannot go over it, then slightly enlarge the opening.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 But if something defeats you from the blood, separate it with a scalpel.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 But if the stone is larger than one, then push into the first large urinary bladebreach.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then incise above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Afterwards push with small blades after that one: and similarly, if there are several ones, do so with two blades.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 For if it is very large, then be ignorant to cut over it in a big section. (This sentence seems incorrect or poorly translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices)
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 For because it happened to a sick person in the place of two things, either that he dies or an ongoing frequent excretion of urine occurs; therefore, because the place is not consolidated at all. (This sentence seems incorrect or poore translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices)
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But provide him with an evacuation until he comes out; or use your skills on his breakage with pincers, until you gradually get it out of him. (This sentence seems incorrect or poorly translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices)
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 Whenever you have completed your operation, then apply thorn dressing, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bandage it, and place soaked cloth over it with oil and wine, or rose-oil, and cold water: to cool down the swelling. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices)
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then place a sick person upside-down on his neck, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices)
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 Whenever you loosen it, emboss the place with much water and oil. (This sentence seems incorrect or poorly translated and doesn't quite make sense as per medical surgical practices)
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the ointment of dafinon, and the ointment of basilico, until he is cured. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices)
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 But if this happens to a swelling with heat added, and rotten, and such things: as if the blood freezes in the bladder, and it is prevented from flowing out of that urine: and one recognizes that by an excretion of blood mixed with urine. (This sentence seems correct as per medieval medical practices)
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore, insert your finger into the wound and extract blood from it.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 If it remains, it causes decay of the bladcuo and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then cleanse the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply all kinds of things suitable to its treatment until it heals.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the entire course of treatment, one must apply two compresses and bandages, according to the medical remedies prescribed for that area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and it's lodged in a male duct, and stuck therein, preventing urine discharge: then treat it with whatever I described before you reach for surgery.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often one is freed from the necessity of surgery through this treatment, which I have already tested.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And you are to obtain a Perforator from iron alfie, which has the following form: triangular at its end, sharp and fixed on wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread and tie it with the male duct so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the Perforator into the male duct with ease until it reaches the stone; and withdraw the Perforatar manually from the same stone gradually: and ascertain the perforation of it until you make the stone pass through the other part.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 For then, urine is immediately released.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand over what remains of the stone from the external part of the male duct.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 For it breaks and comes out with urine, and cures the sick person.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If however this treatment is not prepared for you due to something that prevents it from the stone: then tie a thread underneodefinitely, and another thread over the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then dry over the male duct between the two threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Afterwards dissolve the bandage and cleanse the frozen blood which forms on the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to place a thread under the stone unless to prevent returning to the blister: and another bandage from above, so that when the string unties after the removal of the stone, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound as we mentioned: therefore you must do this when tying the thread from above, to lift up the skin towards the top, so it aligns with your closure, and cover the w지.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Regarding the removal of stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Little stone is formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 But if this happens to someone of them, the treatment is difficult and forbidden for various reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is: that woman may perhaps be a virgin. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'uirgo' means widow rather than virgin in
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a doctor when she is chaste or married. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'casta' should be translated as chaste/pure rather than married.)
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 The third is because you do not find a woman well-versed in this art, especially the operation by hand. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'manu' should be translated as manually or by hand rather than just by hand.)
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And the fourth is the distance of the stone's location: therefore it requires deep incision, and there is fear involved. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'indiget' should be translated as needs or requires rather than just requires.)
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 Because if necessity prompts you to do so, then it is necessary that you accept a woman as your doctor who is well-versed: and few are found. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'parum' should be translated as fewer or not many rather than just few.)
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 But if you are to abandon her, then look for a chaste, skilled and present obstetrician well-versed in the matter of women, or a woman who has innovated in this art: do so with her at hand, especially that she does everything you prescribe from your inquiry about the stone. (Note: This translation appears to contain an error; 'praecipue' should be translated as particularly rather than just especially.)
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, what must be done is that he looks to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary for him to insert his finger into her vagina and feel for a stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 But if he finds it, he should restrain it with his own finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's weak vagina and feel for a stone after she places her left hand over the urinary tract, and compresses (it) with good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 But if he finds the stone, then it is necessary for him to gradually move it from the opening of the urinary tract towards the lower regions with great strength until it reaches as far down to the hip bone.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then he shall cut above it at the midpoint of the vagina near the hip bone from whatever side is prepared for him, and feels the stone there: and his finger should not be moved away from the stone, restraining under it: and (the operation) be a small one first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then he shall insert the probe over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 But if he feels the stone then he should add to the incision a second one of proportional size as that by which the stone emerges from her.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 For among these is the small one, and the large one, soft and rough, long, and round-ended with branches (projections).
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Therefore know its kind so that it may signify to you by this above what is under your hand.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if blood overcomes you then add to the place some grated egg yolk and hold it for an hour until the blood ceases (to flow).
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your own work until the stone is expelled: and do as I prepare with you instruments that I have said for extracting stones from men so that they may aid you through them in your own operation (in women).
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If you are overcome by bleeding and know that the blood is being expelled from a cut artery: then place dust on the area, and bind it tightly with a suitable bandage: do not remove this until you can release the stone, and do not let go of it otherwise.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps indeed the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 Whenever there is an accumulation of blood and the site becomes putrid after days, then return to surgery until the stone passes.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 § Regarding a superficial hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 The watery swelling is not, but an accumulation of moisture in a white lining, which is contained under the skin enclosing the scrotal membrane: and it is called a hydrocele.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	 And sometimes it is within the individual's own panniculus adiposus, which nature has prepared for him in part of his scrotum, until putrefaction occurs: this is another thing, and is a layer of skin between the testicular sheath and the white lamentation that we have described: and it rarely happens.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 And indeed this generation of the branch is from weakness which occurs in the testicles: therefore it discharges into them this matter.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And sometimes it happens by a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 Or indeed its color declines to yellowishness, or it is blood-red, or dirty, black, or it is white watery, and this is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which one knows where there is an accumulation of water are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the white lining that we have described, then there is a round swelling of about equal length as the figure of his scrotum: and the testicle does not appear because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if there is moisture in its own peritoneum, then it is a round abscess with an opening elsewhere, and for this reason the man disregards it because he considers it to be another matter.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under feeling.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When therefore he has understanding of the color of moisture, then try to determine the color of moisture in an abscess with a square intrusion, whose form prevails.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to that which emerges from the examination of the intrusion, judge what is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When therefore we come to healing with iron, then it is proper to instruct the sick person that if possible for him, he should be bled with a fleam, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then lies on his back over something high but low, and place under him many cloths.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then sit on his left and instruct the servant to sit on his right, who extends a splinter of wood to one or two sides of the skin of the testicles, and towards the part of the milky veins.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a wide gauze, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to near the comb: and make an incision according to the rectitude of a line that equally divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane that encompasses them: and remove it and observe, or if possible for you, cut it off: and let your excoriation be such as removes part of itself on the side that suspends with the opening more: and subtly scrutinize along the excoriation according to what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce a full white membrane with a large hole, and extract all water out of it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate between two lips of the section with a hook, and extend the white membbean to the upper parts, and do not touch the skin that encompasses the testicles: and cut in any way possible for you to cut it, either entirely or piece by piece, especially its side subtly.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 Therefore, if you do not examine it carefully, there is no security in making the incision, that water may return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 But if the matter proceeds from outside of its own skin at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the incision with a needle, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather together two lips of the scrotum skin with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Next care for it as other wounds until healed.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 But if you find the matter rotten from another blackness, then it is necessary that flexible tubes, which are supports, fear the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cut off the testicle with the support, and take it out: afterwards care for that thing as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 But if water is collected in two parts, then you know that they are two branches: so cut the other part as you did in one equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it seems equal to you, that there should be but one operation, then do this: afterwards clean blood away.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert into the sections wool soaked in oil or rose oil: and place another kind of wool that you have dipped in wine and oil upon it externally over the two testicles, and apply mirach ointment on them: and place double cloths above, and there are pulvilli (tassels): and tie these up with a band from above with a ligament which has six ties according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then two cloths are taken and washed, and filled with la na ointment according to this likeness: and make the ends that are pressed by a cote or wet wool: and they are gathered with an envelope in lumbar sacs: and one end takes over from the anus up to the back, and the second takes on the side of the sternum: and two ends above the hips downward, and two other ends above the groin, and it is gathered together wholly in lumbar sacs.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes this branch is artificially treated at the place of section with a knife; and it is as you have received the cautery in a delicate chisel, and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is ignited, as we mentioned: until when it reveals a white substance containing water; then receive the cautery according to this method.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 The Greek letters are assimilated into the Latin script.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then the catheter is inserted with it; and it is ignited until all the moisture has come out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then extend the catheter with a hook; and scrape off with a fine-tipped heated cautery, and cut it as much as possible for you, until all of its roots are removed.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And from the egg, so that the fire does not touch the flesh.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 And know that this operation is more healing and farther from blood flow, and better than the procedure with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If however you encounter difficulty in the hour of incision or in the hour of applying heat (cauterization), a hot sore, or blood flow, or something else: then it is necessary that you treat what causes trouble to you from there with the treatment appropriate to it, according to as mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If however he is weak and fearful, and does not await this procedure because of its frightfulness: then apply the catheter according to what I have told you that; and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are certain among yourself according to what we have said about the indications, that the branch is watery: then it is necessary that you do make him sit on a swept seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then apply the catheter at an ulcer on its lower part with a wide-tipped instrument: and place the catheter according to the length of the body, and leave the opening large, until all water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place it over the hollow part and bind its body, and let it drain any remaining water; then care for it until the wound is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 But if there is a hindrance to the drainage at the time you perforate it; and this is only due to the fact that the white fibrous tissue causes an obstruction in the wound opening, preventing water exit: then it is necessary to insert a penned into the wnid, or use a tool from which water of hydropic is extracted (whose form has precedence): or add slightly to the operation of the wound.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that the water returns and accumulates after six months or so.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 Therefore, when it accumuleby the same method, and passes through its own days of illness.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 § On treating thickened veins.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in the dissection over this thick vein, there is out of fear for causing harm to many arrangements.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems appropriate to me that its dismissal be healing from that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I am recalling the operation on that and inflammations of wound sores.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 Therefore I say, that many swellings occur in bodies from which the testicles are composed: and this happens for various reasons, namely. (The text cuts off here without listing the reasons)
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or due to sharpness or bitternebrous fluid that flows into the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or due to impact. (This instruction is incomplete as well and should
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of swellings corresponds to that of the body, and pain is not found therein; it is a serious boil. (This text appears to be incomplete or cut off.)
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone boil, the color of which is brownish, and no feeling is found therein. (This text also appears to be incomplete or cut off.)
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens due to the swelling of arteries and their inflammation: as already mentioned earlier; or due to venous congestion. (Again, the text seems incomplete.)
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 Therefore, what is derived from them through swelling of the vessels is recognized by the arrangement of ulcers when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And yet, it must not be touched at all.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 But that which is due to the swelling of veins cannot be dispersed by anything through compression with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that a section is made on this kind of thing and on the remaining flesh, which involves cutting off scrotal skin.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then extend the veins upwards and take out the flesh with a sharp knife: and free the ligaments of the veins: and cut the ligaments after you have freed the flesh from all sides by parts.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If therefore the veins are united with those of the buttocks, then you must grasp the veins and cut out the flesh.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	 And if there is an attachment between some of the veins or within the ligaments themselves: then you must free all that attachment and cut it out with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 And if there is the birth of flesh at a place behind that attachment: then you must cut out all of it and remove the veins as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When therefore your operation is completed, fill the wound with a poultice of linen soaked in rose oil and wine: then attend to it as well as the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 § Regarding the cure for gouty joints which is with vinegar.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 It is an ulcer formed by some kind of swelling, resembling a blister, with the softening of scrotal skin: and it becomes difficult over the weakened movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness there is from fear, because of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 But let me say about performing an operation on this according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 Therefore, I say that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on an elevated bed.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then push the scrotal supports towards the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then grasp the skin of the testicles with your fingers, using forceps that are close to the shrine: and let another servant hold it, and stretch it firmly.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then make an incision with a sharp, broad knife obliquely across the direction of the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then excise it from all sides as we have told you before in extracting the arteries that are on the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then fix a hook at which there is a double thread, and tie the flesh at the first locations where branches occur, and tie it again on the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it out straight across in the middle according to the length of the body, and extract what is attached from moist foul secretions.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then take care of the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, where you can make a healthy incision so that the vessels which nourish one of the testicles are shed.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not a bad thing through this.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 But if this happens to branches in all vessels, then it is necessary that they are extracted because of the testicles with vessels: so that there will not be a stoppage of nourishment due to incision and shrinkage, and bleeding will cease, and it will not swell with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 ¶ On healing the bowel knots.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The end of this bowel knot is from a section that occurs on the rectum above the abdamen on the side of the groins near the great veins.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from there due to rupture to one of the testicles.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the rectum or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 And these two kinds occur for many reasons: either from impact, or leakage, or noise, or serious illness, and similar ones.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And a mark, when it is from the extension of an ulcer.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 And it occurs gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly; and the abscess is equal in depth around; therefore, because the ulcer compresses the inte**
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And the sign of this is when it comes from the section of an ulcer because its intense pain happens suddenly at its beginning; and the abscess is varied in appearance, close to the skin: and that one results from the exiting of the intestine, and the course thereof towards the external ulcer.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with an intestinal fistula; and this is called the Intestinal Ramus, and a Zibelain; and sometimes it happens with puffiness.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And sometimes it runs into the intestine with feces and remains there; and this is accompanied by great peril for the sick person because it causes a dull pain, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of this disease's species with iron is fear; therefore it must be ensured that there is no cause for it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 And the method of operation is to advise the sick person to bring in their own hand the intestine back towards its inner recesses if it returns willingly.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he lies on his neck between your hands: and support his legs gently.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin that follows to the upper part, and shave the entire scrotum lengthwise.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then fix the two lip edges of the incision with a hook as you find to open the incision with them; and let the incision be made according to quantity that is possible so that it can come out from this wound.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the ulcer and what is under the skin of the testicles until a hard white ulcer shows itself all around: then insert your index finger into it that follows the testicle, between the ulcer album which is under the skin, and between the sifach as well; and detach completely from its adherence on the posterior part of the scrotum.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move with the right hand to the inner skin of the testicles; and while doing this, stretch an alb with your left hand, and latch them together at the division point: instruct the assistant to also raise theirs, and you loosen any attachment that is completely detached.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And use your fingers to check if there'amo not something from the empty intestine into the white hard alb.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If, however, you find anything from that within it: then push it downward to the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten strands: and insert it behind the last alb, that is, under the tunics that follow the division below the skin of the testicles; then cut off the protruding tips until there are four strands remaining.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then connect some of them together with the figure that resembles a cross-shape; and bind them to the alb mentioned earlier, which is the ligament under the skin of the testicles, until they cannot send anything from the vessels, which nourish them, into them: so that it does not happen there afterward a hot swelling.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligament next to the first ligament, about two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments inside the alb that is under the skin of the testicles, measure a quantity equal to the size of a finger; and cut off the rest around it completely, and remove them from there.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then cut off the lower part of the skin of the testicles from where the blood and pus flow; as we have mentioned above.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply moist wool soaked in oil to the wound: and place there the ligaments we have mentioned. (Note: The translation is based on a medieval Latin medical text, which can contain terminology that doesn't always directly map onto modern English anatomical or surgical terms; therefore, certain liberties were taken for clarity.)
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And at times it is branded white syphax that we have mentioned, after making an incision there to prevent the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 But often this happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 And release the ligament until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 But if this case is delayed, then pour warm water on it: and place that which we have mentioned upon it, until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then care for the wound with the remaining treatment of wounds, until healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 § On the draft wind (whooping cough).
Caput LXVI.	 Head LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this whooping cough, I have not seen anyone brave enough to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	 And the first ones said that it is done as we have narrated for whooping cperture which has a draft wind (whooping cough).
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 This is to say, the strips of leather are used after cutting over it with ease below: then dried in the middle, and care for them lastly with that which opens it up until they fall off: and care for the wound as we have said, until healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 § On the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	 Head LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When the rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and a place protrudes out, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles: and if it does descend, it is little amount, and returns at all times: but if prolonged for that time, an ulceration will be added in syphax until the intestines descend into syphax.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this happens from the extension of syphax that is in the groin as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 This is because the syphax extends out: then softens it and applies a compress to the place, which protrudes out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its care is with branding as has been said in its previous account.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes it is cared for with iron according to this method: and it stays on the back of the patient between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then, one should dry the place of a rupture or prominent swelling by cutting across its width, according to the amount for three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then bind it tightly with a cloth, and whatever is under the skin until when the white bandage, which is also under the skin, appears.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take a rod and place it over the prominent swelling from the white bandcuce, and press it deep into the folds.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then take two prominent places above the end of the rod from the white bandage, and connect one of them with a stitch to the other; then remove the end of the rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 And do not cut the white bandage at all, nor stretch the wound, nor anything else, as you know from curing intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then take care of that treatment for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 Whenever you cut sutures, clean it and heal the wound until it solidifies.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 The white bandage itself is tightening, and no prominence of rupture is added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And a caustic is better in this place: for it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Regarding the softening of scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 Often the skin of the scrotum is softened in certain people because the flesh between them is also softened, and it becomes ugly-looking.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore, the one who is asked for treatment of it must make him lie on his back, and cut off all softened skin over natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two lips with a stitch; and if you can, do first three excesses of softened skin with stitches or four, and a firm st^racture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then take care of treatment for other wounds, until they heal, and the sutures fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	 Section on Castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 Know that castration is excommunicated by our law; and for this reason it was permisseby me not to remember it in this book of mine; and there is no need for its mention except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One of them being that it should be known to the physician when asked about it and so that he may know its treatment when such a thing occurs.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And another reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit by this method, such as ram, hedgehog, cat, and similar beasts from the animal kingdom.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways. (Note: The translation may slightly vary depending on the rest of the text for context.)
Aut per attritionem.	 Either by wearing down. (Note: A complete solution would depend
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or through a crack and incision. (Note: The actual translation may vary based on the full context of the text
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In that which is done by wearing down, the method of procedure is as follows: We make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and become relaxed and hanging, then tear them off with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear upon touch. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 For the castration by cracking and cutting, you should hold the animal and press its scrotal skin with your left hand. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the suspender and cut above all along one side of the incision until two sides are exposed: then make an incision on both after you have scraped them off, and do not let anything other than a very fine substance fall onto it, which is over gauze. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than the one that happens by weaving down because wear and tear may leave something from the testicles, which is why the animal needs to mate. (Note: This translation assumes an extended excerpt for contextual understanding.)
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Then there are two methods of treating Hermaphroditus.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 The Hermaphrodite is considered in two ways as a man.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because a space appears that follows, or within the skin of the testicles, between the two testicles, with the shape of a woman's vagina, where hairs are present: and sometimes urine flows from what is inside the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 In women there is one kind of species, and it resembles a woman's vagina placed on the chest like masculine testicles altogether protruding to the outside: one of which is like a penis of a man, and two as two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of three kinds of species, two from men and one from women, is as follows: because it must be that you cut away added flesh until the imprint of those marks disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then care for other wound treatments.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 However, the treatment of the second kind from men, from which urine comes out within the skin of the testicles, is not a surgery nor any kind of its treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Then regarding the incision of tentigoes and protruding flesh on women's vaginas.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Perhaps a tentigo is added over the natural one until it becomes disgusting and an ugly appearance of it: and sometimes it is magnified in certain women so much that it expands like in men, and comes to sexual intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore one must hold the excess of tentigoes with a hand or with an hook, and cut them: but do not end the incision especially at the root's depth, so that blood loss does not happen.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the actual treatment of wounds until they heal.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 However, the flesh that is born is the flesh which originates from the maternal orifice, until it fills up this space; and perhaps it exits externally according to the likeness of a tail; and for this reason some call it tail-illness.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, we must attack her as we attacked the Swelling, and heal her until she is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 Of treating the Alratic condition, which is a hole in the woman that has not been pierced.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The Alratic condition is such that it be a hole in the woman or a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 The accidental one is from an illness that preceded it: and this indeed comes about either due to added flesh or subtle sinew or thickening; and it occurs either deep in the maternal orifice, or on its sides, or at the top of it, or at the bottom of it. It prevents intercourse, impregnation, childbirth, and perhaps menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And recognition of this is through an obstetrical examination if there is a visible bulge near it.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 But if it does not appear, then you search for it with your fingers or with the rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If however there is a bulge from subtle sinew and it is near to two lips, then do so promptly, and break the same apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is as if you place something small over the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then put your fingers of both hands at once, and let the woman be on her back with spread apart legs.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then extend the two lips with strength until the subtle sinew is broken and the bulge opens up.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool and soak it in oil, and put the same on top of the place: and let the woman rub there every day, so that another spot does not harden up.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 However, if a sifface is thick and dense: then it should be cut with a paste similar to that of bay leaves.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 However, if the swelling is of fleshly origin: then suspend it with a hook and make an incision in it; and be with medicines that suppress bleeding without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and combined with alburnum.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then apply a large lead cannula so that the wound is not congested quickly, hold it for several days; and then administer linseed lime oil, afterwards care for the remaining treatment until healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And at times when births occur from the womb of other creatures: therefore they should be incised according to this manner: as long as there is no inflammebile tumor that has been tumored with cancer itself within the womb, do not cause any opposition with iron altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 § For the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athelill and Bothorus redness in women's swellings.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Indeed, hemorrhoids are an opening of the venous orifices until blood flows out from them in great amounts persistently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 And so when we treat hemorrhoids, thymel are formed: and I have already spoken about the division of those kinds and their signs; and here I will say which receive treatment from them and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids that are located at the opening of the womb and not visible to sense: then there is no treatment for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those from among them that are located at the opening of the w [womb] above which sense falls: these are treatable.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it should be to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend Athelill with forceps or with rough cloth, and incise them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then powder over them at the flow of blood from a ground powder without bites: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and so on.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then he pushes his feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Afterward, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and grape skins, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, and make it into a paste with honey and vinegard, and create a plaster from it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If therefore blood is separated with it, it is good; and if not, let it stick to the back with vents, and nipples, without scraping.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool, and immerse it in the juice of Taraxia, or the juice of Arno grasshopper, or the juice of winged alauda (gallinaceous bird), that is, without shearing, with Pontic wine, and let it stick to the eyelids.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Whenever the abscess calms down, then heal the place with ointments, until healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 However, red albatross is similar to heads of alhaas (a type of camelid), and it has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, you must cut what appears from it, as I said before equally: and heal it itself, until healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 § About the perforation of a uterus that occurs during childbirth.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter 74.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 In the womb there occur many kinds of abscesses, such as carcinoma, and stone-abscess, and ulcers, and sores with a crust, and smallpox, and eczema, that is, herpes, stitching, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and ragged (wounds), and heat abscesses.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And indeed, I have already said of all these illnesses and their kinds, as well as the signs of them and their treatments in division: it is necessary for me to say in this treatise about swelling that occurs in the womb, which arises from those that heal ligatures, and how one should know how its opening is done with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 It is therefore important to consider: the treatment of a thrombosed external hemorrhoid
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 Then if the pain of a swelling on its inception is sharp with palpation and heat and fever, and you see it reddening: if sensations fall upon it, then do not hasten to puncture it: and treat it as long as healing occurs above when the severity of symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	 Then it is fitting to make the woman sit on a seat that suffers two chairs and lean, or lie down on her back, and gather her feet towards the lower part of her vagina: and let her thighs be spread out, and she places her arms under her knees, and ties both ligaments suitable to this.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and give the instrument that opens the birth canal entrance.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Which shape comes among those who are after: (This phrase is incomplete and seems to lack context for a proper translation; typically, it would refer to variations or
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And when you are to give this instrument, make it with a depth of the birth canal as wide as the woman's pelvis: so that what is inserted from the tool shall not be more than the depth of the birth canal and hurt the sick one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 But if the tool were more than the depth of the birth canal, then you should place small cushions on top of the seat of the depth of the birthamo: so that the entrance of the tool is completely in the depth of the birth canal: and it should be placed a swelling which runs along the side of the tool above: and hold the tool itself, and have the assistant move the swelling until the depth of the birth canal opens.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 Therefore, when the incision appears and is touched with a hand, it is gentle and soft; then one must cut it at its head with a slightly broad knife.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 Therefore, when the blood is drained, then one must place a compress soaked in rose oil or greenish oil with some stickiness on it; and after placing the compress, extract out of the wound into a deep sack.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 And place outside on the sack, and over the chest with clean woolen cloth soaked in water that contains light froths.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it will be treated after two days with an ointcuh suitable for this, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the sack and wound are washed so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water containing the root of a lily or Aristolochia longa; and then return to ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 That if the wound is hidden internally in the sack, then one must restrain it from its treatment with iron; indeed treat it as we mentioned in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 § Knowledge of Midwifery, how embryos are healed by the image not natural to be born.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for a midwife to know first of all the figure of natural childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 Therefore, from these signs, when you see a woman pressing downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and light is reflected over her that lies above childbirth, and hasten the exit of the embryo: then know that this childbirth is according to the natural figure, and it exits through its head, and turning with it: or hanging, or suspended from the umbilical cord.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 Therefore, when you see these signs, then one must compress her belly so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 Therefore, when it descends upon its head, it is accompanied by a second one, and they cleanse themselves of excesses with good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 Whoever else there may be besides this offspring, it is unnatural, to be lamented.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Since sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet and exits with its body before its head, and its feet or hands alone, or one foot only; or it exits with its head and hands; or even the buttocks; and perhaps it turns over onto its back, along with other admirable shapes.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent and subtle about all these matters, and she should guard herself against error and deceit: and I am showing every shape from among them, and how there is an understanding in each one, and it signifies by that, and stands over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus exits naturally upon its head, and a powerful flow occurs over the woman, and difficult childbirth ensues, weakening her strength: then make her sit on a stool or have women hold her: and apply warm wine with foenugraecum decoction, and moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 Then the midwader introduces a sponge-like cloth between her fingers and strikes with it upon a second one, and cuts off its nail of hers until what is in it runs out from moisture: and she presses the woman's perineum, until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer an enema of the woman with a mixture from foenugraecum and sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then instruct her to press after the enema: and have her sneeze with compresses, and hold one of her mouths and noses for an hour each.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 Therefore, the fetus should come out immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 But if two hands of the fetus emerge first, one must gradually push them back with ease.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 However, if this is not possible during delivery, place the woman on a stool and elevate her feet: then shake the seat onto the ground; and keep the woman steady so she does not fall due to the impact.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If therefore the hands do not come out and the fetus dies: then incise them, and remove any remaining fetal tissue; fasten her hand with cloth, and extract it evenly: for she will also emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The exit of an embryo above its feet. (This phrase seems to lack context or appears incomplete in the original Latin translation.)
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus emerges above its feet, one must push them upwards; then gradually turn the fetus; afterwards align it properly. (This phrase seems to be giving procedural advice for breech deliveries.)
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one of its feet and slowly extend it. (Providing instructions on how to handle a footling breech delivery where only the feet or legs are presenting first.)
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 But if the baby comes as far as the thighs, instruct her to press and make her sneeze with spittle: she will come out, if God wills it. (This is likely referencing a technique or hopeful saying rather than specific medical advice.)
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 And if it does not come out as we described, then gradually push the fetus back until you can place it in its natural position. (Advice for repositioning a breech baby within the womb before attempting delivery.)
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For he himself will come out then with an easy exit. (A statement about the potential ease of delivering a fetus once properly positioned for birth.)
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 But if you are prevented with the whole thing that we described: then take honey from a high-altitude beehive, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum resin; and strike it completely in a mortar through good percussioning: then line it with wool of a young woman, and her lower vent. (A description likely related to making some type of medicinal preparation or poultice.)
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until menstruation occurs.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 And so when you see that the lower parts are already warmed up, then make her take some of myrrh powder and apply it to herself.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When she holds one hour, then make her sit on top of the seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeeblow and close her mouth and nose, and gently press the lower part of the womb with a light pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For immediately the fœtus will come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 ¶ The exit of the fetus over thighs and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out following this method, then gently insert her own fingers gradually into [the vagina].
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back, and her feet hang down to the lower parts: and she sits lying on the bed, and folds her hands together.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently above [the womb] gradually.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then extract what is under her feet from the dregs, until it is prepared on the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 But if the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with a strong motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gradually what is above [the vagina], until the fetus goes up to the upper parts.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then she gently inserts her own fingers and balances the fetus gradually: and command the woman to press until the fetus comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 ¶ The exit of the fetus hanging down from [the] hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 She is inserted into a withdrawal of her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 But if she cannot draw it out, then comfort the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with a strong shocking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply an ointment that you prepared from muds.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 But if she accepts [the birth], then make her sit on top of the seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then attend to the setting of bones and properly align according to natural shape; and cause a woman to sneeamoorthe woman to be instructed to press down until she gives birth.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 Then the fetus lies over its neck, with hands spread and face against the mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 It is necessary for the midwife to hold the fetus with her hand and then gradually turn it until it is properly positioned.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 Once this is corrected, place as described on our female over the area with oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then instruct her to move it gradually.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 Once you have done this, then make her sit on the stool and instruct her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then instruct her to press down with conditions for sneezing.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 Then the fetus is positioned over one side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the birth canal as described with assistance from a woman's companion, then cut the companion's nail with your fingernail until it dries out.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If thusly the fetus is suspended over its face and neck, then cut it from the navel so that it does not hold on and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus into the body until placed as it should be: and instruct the woman to press down several times, for indeed he will come out lightly.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Then twins or multiple offspring are born.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins often occur: and sometimes three, and sometimes four are born at once.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 But this is foreign and rare.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 Five on the other hand are unnatural and do not live entirely: they are held together by a single companion woman: and separated through dissection, distinguishing between them with a string tied to each one's navel.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they emerge as does a single fetus from natural birth, easily; and they emerge unfortunate, as I have described.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 But if some of them are difficult at birth, and come to what we have described from unnatural figures; then care for them as I have described: and let it be with a subtle stretcher, doing both easily and slowly, and forming according to every figure that is prepared by the skill guiding toward health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Recall that it forms in the womb from embryos, and they abort.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes it forms in the womb one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and many more ten: and I have verified that a woman while aborting has emitted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 That was measured by the great wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this should be entirely in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 For perhaps it may come to that similar to those: thus oppose it with what is fitting.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 ¶ Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you care for a dead fetus as I have described in division from medicine, and it does not emerge, and you resort to the operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If then the woman is of sound constitution and not with any one from which she fears ruin: then it should be that she lies on a bed, on her back, and her head inclined lower, and her legs elevated: and a servant holds her by both sides or ties to the bed so as not to extract the body of hers during the fetal extraeusure.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then moistened the mouth of the womb with oils damped by an abundance of mucilage from poppy juice and fenugreek, and flax seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife fastens her hand with those oils and cataplasms; then she inserts it into the womb easily.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then she seecuires the place where to insert the hooks from the fetus and suitable places for it.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Consider then, if the fetus is ready to descend onto its head: then fix the hooks on its eyes, or neck, or mouth,amo, palate, or under its beard, or on its shoulders, and near the hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If however the descent is over his feet, then on the chest, and along the sides of his body.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it must be that she holds the hook with her right hand; and places elasticity between the fingers of her left hand: and inserts with her hand easily, and fixes the hook on one of those places that we have mentioned, until it reaches a hollow space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then she fixes on the opposite of his hook another one or third if you seek it: so that there is equal contraction, and it does not lean towards any side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then be extended to an equal length, and not just according to straightness; indeed move it towards every side, so as to ease its passage out: as with a tooth during extraction from him.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it must be that within that, there is softened extension.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 That if it retains a part of that, then it must be that the midweb fastens some fingers with oil and inserts them from the side so as to revolve around what is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then change the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the entire fetam has been expelled.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If however the hand emerges before others and cannot be reduced, because of its compression: then it must be that a cloth revolves over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then remove it once it emerges completely; make an incision at the joint of the foot or at the knee. In this way, you must create a shape like a hand and two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 But if the head of the fetus is large or it happens that there is a blockage during delivery, or water has accumulated within its head; then one must insert the spatula-like tool among its fingers and break off the head along with it, and remove the fluid: or crush it using an instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with other tools mentioned in the chapter following this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Likewise, if the fetus is of large head nature, then one must perform a cesarean section; or remove it with an Almisdac as we mentioned earlier.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then grasp the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head emerges and there is a blockage at the clamp: then it must be found until the moisture inside the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 But if there are no complications and it does not aid delivery: then you must cut the head as much as possible according to what is achievable by you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 Which if there is a boil below the vagina or it has an accumulation of water: then one must puncture it until the moisture flows out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 However if the fetus is above its feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction to the mother's mouth is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 But if there is a blockage at the vagina or chest: then one must remove it with cloth that you have wrapped over your hand; and blow into the vagina or chest until whatever is inside comes out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 But if other body parts are removed and the head returns: then the midwife must insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If therefore the mouth of the mother is open, then one must insert a hand deep into the womb and search with it for the head, and draw out as far as the mouth of the mother; then one must insert either one hook or two hooks, and draw out as much as possible from there.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the uterine bone is fractured due to a hot suppuration that has occurred there, then it should not be required to work on it; instead, one should administer an infusion of moistening substances and fatty materials, and apply plasters, and let it rest in waters that soften and moisturize.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, it may be possible to correct it; then administer what we have mentioned for live fetuses.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that is not possible, then it should be lanced gradually and removed in parts.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And one must ensure nothing is expelled from the second stage entirely.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 Once you have completed your surgery, then administer what we have mentioned for hot suppurations that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, it should be allowed to flow into astringent waters, and one should administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 And indeed, I have already seen a woman whose womb was dead following the death of a fetus; then she became pregnant again with another, but then that fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore, she experienced a long-lasting suppuration at her navel and became swollen until it was opened; then it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I have been called for her treatment, and have treated her over a prolonged period; the wound has not yet healed solidly.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 Therefore, I applied certain strong attracting plasters to it, and discharged pus from the site.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then several days passed, and more pus was discharged.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I have been astonished by this therefore, since there is no bone left in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 I considered that these were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I examined the wound and extracted many bones from a woman who was otherwise in good health: she has now survived for such a prolonged time and discharges only a little pulsating pus from it.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 And I have not established this foreign thing here, except because there is knowledge and help for it, which a physician-artificer administers with his hand in healing.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 On the necessary forms of instruments for extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVamoht.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of the traction instrument, which balances books and two twists are equal on both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 However, this vertigo must be with a finer traction instrument; and so it is made from either ebony or seasoned wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And the entire width of each piece of wood is like two fingers; and the edge of both has a margin as if one finger, and their length is a hand wide and halfway: and between these two pieces ofwood are two additions from that type of wood, already firmly placed in both, whose length is half a palm and slightly more, and their width is like two fingers or slightly less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the womb's mouth so that it opens when you withdraw with them both vertigos.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the vertigo which opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another similar but finer and lighter form.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Made from ebony or seasoned wood, according to the likeness of pincers.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 However, at the end of it there are two additions, just as you see above here: and the length of each addition is like a hand wide, and their width is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 So when you want to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two connected additions into the womb: and you hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with scissors, evenly according to the amount that you wish from the opening of the birth canal, so that the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Shape of agitation other than the one called by the ancients as Forma Impellentang (the shape that propels the fetus).
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 Shape of Albucasis, which is used to cut large heads; and it resembles a forceps with teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it is oval like a forceps of this shape as you see with teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which to cut and trim.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 Shape of Albucasis used for cutting small heads.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 Shape with one spike (forceps).
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 Shape with two prongs (forceps).
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 Forceps shape with saw teeth used to cut the fetus' head.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 Shape for cutting off heads with two blades (forceps).
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 Also shape of two Cuttlebugs. This could be interpreted as a reference to another type of surgical tool or instrument used in the same
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 These instruments are all used together; the more their types multiply, and the more they are prepared by the craftsman, the faster they are for performing operations, and higher in humans, because of their quantity. (The translation maintains a formal tone while conveying the original message about the importance of using multiple well-prepared instruments.)
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore do not disdain any of these instruments if they are prepared among you. (The translation captures a didactic tone from the source text, emphasizing the importance of every instrument's preparation.)
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 The need for them is indeed inexcusable. (This succinct sentence retains an assertive and authoritative tone found in many
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Concerning the extraction of a breech child. (The translation delivers clear instruction while pres
Caput LXXVIII.	 Head seventy-eigh. (This numbered notation indicates a particular method
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the breech child is retained during labor, then it is necessary to instruct the weakened, so that they retain their breathing (i.e., encourage the mother not to push). (The translation interprets a medical directive from historical practice while maintaining original context.)
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with the following conditions: and place your hand firmly on her mouth, and her nostrangs.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If she therefore comes out by this [method], it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not, then take a bowl and pierce the cover's hole: and place in it herbs that open the womb's mouth, such as calamint, rue, anise, camomile, sage, woody cedar, and centaury; take all these herbs or some of them, submerge them with water, and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place a reed's bulb over the cover's hole of the bowl, and another end into her mouth; and hold it until vapors reach the womb's swelling.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For secondine will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 But if she remains after this treatment and does not come out: then command an obstetrician to immerse his hand in saffron oil or tall poppy syrup.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert into the womb and seek what is secondine with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When he has found her, then take her and gradually stretch out.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 But if she is deeply attached within the womb, then he should insert his hand as we said until when he finds secondine and gradually pulls her out straight according to rectitude, so that it does not fall onto a strong pulling force: on the contrary, it must be turned with ease towards both right and left sides; after this add in amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 For she indeed then submits and is served, and flees from attachment.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 Which if the womb's mouth is curtailed as we already said: care for it with sneezing, and from the bowl treatment with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 However, if it does not come out with all that we have described, then do not worry about the bone during the process of extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 However, it is necessary that what emerges to the mother'amo reedile from that, be close to the thigh of the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then purify her with a clitoral ointment made of four drugs.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 For indeed it will putrify after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 However, when it rots, remove the bad smell from the stomach and head, and harm that thing weakens her.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, they must administer appropriate fumigations to this.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 However, some of the ancients were already experienced in fumigation with nasturtium and dry figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The form of the instruments to be used for fumigating a woman during Retentio Secundina (retained second stage labor) and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Let a container be made similar to an alcama or from wax: and the wide end is placed over fire: and the fumigation shall be positioned above plums: hold it until that fumigamoination is consumed: and do another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Of healing for Ana not pierced.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many children are born, and the child of Ana is not pierced, whom she already delivered with a gentle forceps.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife must pierce that notch with her finger: and if not, pierce it with a sharp spatula: and beware of touching it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then put over it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of that thing with ointments until it heals.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 However, if you have pierced too much, then place a lead pipe in the hole for many days, and remove it when the child wishes to relieve himself.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And indeed Ana already had a piercing from the healing of wounds or pustules.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, it is necessary to perform that consolidation, then care for it with what we mentioned in the healing and lead (plumb).
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 From the treatment of Flutes which occur on the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 The Flutes that occur on the lower part are Swelling and Thickening occurring near the genital openings: or in a space of one side: and it is a single Flute or several. (This sentence seems to be discussing types of fistulas or swellings related to surgical procedures, which might refer to Albucasis's descriptions.)
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 Therefore, when that Swelling is outdated, it opens up and runs with a white watery moisture or thin pus. (This sentence talks about the management of swellings as described in ancient medical texts.)
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes they are from piercing Flutes. (The reference to "Fistulas" here may relate to surgical punctures or perforations
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore these piercing Flutes are recognized by what comes out with evacuation and breathing when the sick uses evacuation: and perhaps it comes from them worms (this could be a reference to Albucasis' medical practices regarding surgery or the treatment of certain conditions related to fluid discharge).
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And these are Flutes that are piercing up to the vesicle and up to the vaginal foreskin (this likely refers to types of fistulas or abnormal openings in surgical contexts).
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And these are piercing Flutes up to the hip joint and up to the tail knot (this could be a description of anatomical landmarks in relation to surgical fistulas or similar medical conditions).
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From this also by which is recognized the piercing Flute up to the genital opening, even from the non-piercing one, it is such that you put your finger into the genitals: and you insert a thin thread in the Flute with wire or iron when there is no twisting (this instruction could pertain to surgical techniques described by Albucasis for treating fistulas).
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 But if there is a twisting (in the fistula or pathway), then you insert into it with a thin lead wire, or a feather from eagle's quills, until you feel the wire or quill in your finger (this sentence elaborates on surgical procedures for handling complex cases of fistulas).
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it fully within yourself and nothing proceeds from the opening due to excretion or winds or a worm as I have mentioned; then you know that it is not penetrating: so be quick in providing treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladaster or urethra; then its indication is an exit of urine from it, and prevention from this so that it may be solidified with medicine at that place.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it is penetrating up to the hip joint or into the pelvis bone; then its sign is that it reaches there with probes if there is no twisting as far as the bone: and discovery of pain in the region, and that pus always flows from it: and that treatment does not prevail in it nor solidifies with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 And for all these fistulas that are penetrating there is no treatment at all: and the cure of them is a labor and vanity upon him from foolish doctors who form their opinion on it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 But for those that are not penetrating and new, it is hoped to heal with a bandage: as I tell you, and I have already tested it: and it lies sickly in your hands upon its back: and the branches of his legs up above its hips; and its hips themselves bend towards the windshaft.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then for those that are introduced with lead or air if it is a fistula with twisting, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 But if the sickly feels it around his anus, then it is necessary for you to insert your index finger into his anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 But if you feel the probe already having penetrated through itself detected, besides that you felt between your finger and its flesh: then indeed you know it is penetrangible: therefore no labor on it, for there is not its cure, as I have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 However, they say that it is healed in some men through flesh and the hope placed on treatment, to subtly cauterize the narrowness of the fistula as if it has passed, and insert the burning material into the f지stula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat that process twice or three times until you know that all those added meats have been burned and filtered, which are like the tubes of a bird's feather.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then take care of that process with ointments dissolved in butter until those burned meats are expelled; then take care of it with ingredients generating and solidifying flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If however healed, good is achieved.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 And if not, then never heals with another treatment ever.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 And if it is expelled when tested and does not reach up to your finger inside the anus, which lies between that thick layer made of flesh or syrup: and you see the fistula in what follows on the surface of the skin, then cut off the skin from where the fistula begins, and you go cutting with that which is inside the fistule, until it reaches the incision where the extremity has reached, and releases the tentacle and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then purify those filtered meats which are like tubes of a bird's feather so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 However if blood overcomes you, and dissolves between you and your operation as it separates those meats: then better what is done, and faster healing, to cauterize it with fire or with acute medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 For the fire from the caustery combines good habits, adding burning to those added meats, and incision of blood, and drying moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then attend to that matter with ointments applied on honey or beaten calves' intestines until it discharges pus and the burnt flesh falls into it.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then care for that wound with solidified ointments producing hard flesh and there are medicines which have astringency and drying action.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For indeed when they heal, then it is already cured: and not repeated.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 But if the fistula has reached as far as the depth of the buttocks and extends due to bodily excesses: then insert your finger into the anus, and examine with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 But if indeed you feel weakness, and there is a membrane or flesh between yourself and it, and it is close to perforation: then no operation on that matter, but only according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 That is because it is treated in one of three ways: or as we said, by burning the same, or cutting it out until you achieve a hollowness there, so that you can insert your spoon into it and heal from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with cutting, so that you do not cut the fence of the buttocks containing the anus, and it may occur to the weakened excretion unwillingly.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then attend to that matter as we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 For perhaps it will heal: or you extend the membrane there and soften it yourself after cutting all of that to near the anus, as we said, or with weakness, or with another sharp tool.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then cleanse those sifted flesh which are in the cut, until you can with probing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then try restoration of the whole wound with cutting and the upper opening where it solidifies: and remains open fistula inside the buttocks, and will be weaker than the weakened one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And at times the fistula is treated in this manner: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with skin and edge of the ane; then take hold of the probed extremity, which is like a quill plucked from a goose, that is to say, prepared leather, in this manner.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a wound thread of five threads and about so.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the probe with a string into the fistula until you achieve its contouring.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 But if it penetrates into the inner edge near it, then extract the string from that opening; so as to insert your finger in the anus and extract the extremity of the string, and join both ends together: and fasten each one, and dismiss them for a day or two days; and the more the thread is cut into the flesh, the better grip it. And when those meats which are between the two extremities of the string fall off, treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 But if the opening of the f groove is not penetrating: then make that thing pierce however prepared you are for it, as long as it is not deeply much.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For indeed there is none with you to do this because of the arm, so that you will not cut yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then do as we have said until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of the spinal fistula which is found, whose curvature is sharply pointed, and one part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 Of the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows out from the incision of them: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 Therefore, some are like small bladders made of charcoamo or plums; or they seem to be grains of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And among them there are small ones and large ones; the blood always flows from them, they are one, and there are many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And there are also outside the bladder and at its ends.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those that are outside the bladederelate more to being dry, from which a light yellowish water flows; or they have only scanty blood flow continuously: and they relate in color to the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And its healing method within the bladder is that you should advise a sick person to apply heat; and it is expressed until the bladder comes out, and small veins appear on your thighs.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, suspend them with a hook or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them near their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 But if they do not hold in hooks because of their moisture and softening themselves: then catch them with rough cloth or a leather piece from Codpiece, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them, and sprinkle some warm powders over them after the incision so that they remain in place like a caustic.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Or burn them as precedented in the chapter of cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then take care of them with the remaining treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 But if the anus does not obey the expulsion, then administer a small enema to the sick person so that it is gently taken within the anus and submits quickly to the expulsion when he expresses himself.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 But if the small veins are outside the anus, then their treatment is light and easy: and it is like catching them with your nail or hook, and cutting them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them as we have mentioned until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And if one is averse to cutting with iron, then you should administer the stitches to them in this manner.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a wound thread and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then extract the thorn from above and make it penetrate with a sharp point at its root on one side: and wrap two ends of the thread around the needle, along its narrower part; and pull tightly the threads in such a way that they are parallel.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then bind the thread and remove the neednose.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all thorns, and let go one of them: so that it may not move from its place as blood flows out excessively.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then apply the moistened bandage soaked in rose oil or cedar oil to the wound and place it on top of it; command the patient to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then remove it when it falls off by itself.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 And when the thorns fall off by themselves, care for them with ointments and continue treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 § On treating fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 Often however they occur from dry stools and natural contraction of the tissues.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they become aged and there is no moisture in them: then you should scrape with spatulas or your own nails until they are made wet, and remove the upper layer that prevents them from becoming solidified.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then care for them as needed until they harden properly.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If however they do not solidify: then repeat them with a stronger incision than the first one until there is much bleeding, and once they have scabbed over, care for them as needed until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 § On the treatment of mirror-like lesions and not mirror-like lesions: and pus thorns, and ants.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Chapter 8eb. You should know that the Almirmar is nothing but a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to a lion's head; and it occurs throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers; and pain occurs during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 It is therefore necessary to cut out what surrounds the lion's head and hold it with forceps or a hook, and remove it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then care for that: and if you can cauterize it as described in the previous chapter itself.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 However, there is a small elevation that is dry, rough, porous, and rounded above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And it often occurs in the hands of boys.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 And its treatment is to extend the elevation and cut it open; or bind it with a silk thread; or with hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 And if you can, cauterize it as mentioned with fire or sharp medicine; and already the elevations facing are being removed, and not those not facing with the tool that I will mention.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Also the anthill is a small elevation that is porous and thick on top of the body's surface, penetrating deeply: and when found cold, it feels like an ant bite there, and occurs throughout the body; and most of it appears in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And its treatment is to receive a tube from the goose feather or the strong raven'amoebiasis_feather: and place the tube over the anthill until it surrounds parts of the elevation by the tube.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then remove your hand with the tube, cut out what surrounds the anthill; and place it deep into the flesh, and remove the roots of the anthill from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you can do this with an air or iron tube, according to this method.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Let a higher tube be drawn towards the sublime, with a hoarse and muffled sound, so that it may relieve pressure on the grasped finger and its own retraction.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 If you wish to burn a (medical) scar by the method mentioned earlier for fly-bite cauterization in chapter on burning of Athelil.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Of the forms of instruments used for enemas in cases of constipation, winds, and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 Sometimes enemas are made from silver, brass, cast iron, or wrought iron.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes they are administered with small and large instruments according to those mentioned above.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of small children, be small: and for those whose anus are weak or painful, so too their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	 Large enema.
Cistere paruum.	 Small enema.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The head of the tube, that is, the upper part through which it is tied, be ample according to this model: and it has a clear distinction so that its opening where the tube enters into the anus is muffled, meaning not open, gentle, rough, drawn towards subtlety: and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side it has one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And the size of the hole is according to the thickness of its rays, and thicker but little, and it be an instrument where medicines from urine are placed: or from a strip of paper that follows the model of the small asphaltum: whose root is one handbreadth.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it pierces through multiple holes like its retraction and has a space that equals the thickness of every finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw wool that is made of ten threads or about that, and attach it with ointment like the small asphaltum.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 Therefore, when it is placed in that womb, a clyster is tightened at its head with strong constriction between two distinctions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then the clyster is made with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the form of these circles here depicted and openings.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 However, the quality of making a clyster with it is as follows: fill an urn or bladder with medicine that has been heated to the amount the patient can bear; and let it not be too hot or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the patient is laid on his back and raises his legs to the upper part; and place it under him, that is, a skin or bandage on top of where people lie.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then clean the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with flaxseed mucilage, or similar substances.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert its contents into the anus easily.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then the assistant receives the urn with both hands at once and expresses its contents forcefully until all that is in the ccuester has gone into the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clyster and raise the patient's legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If he thinks the medicine is coming out of him, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more beneficial for resting.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If the clyster causes him discomfort from wind-like solutions and his evacuation is hastened: then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 But if there are hemorrhoids or ulcers injuring the anus, then let it be a very gentle clyster, mild, from the clysters with which children are made.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this is the form of a gentle clyster for where there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 For curing wounds in the head without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 Now, as I have explained the treatment of wounds by division in a previous book, so too shall I address their healing with hands and medicine according to the remedy.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, I say that wounds vary according to how they are made and the location on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 The wounds that often occur are like being struck by stones or swords cuts, or being hit with a spear, tree, or arrow, and similar things from many sources.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that occur depending on body parts are such as a ward falling over the head or neck, chest, abdamoen, and similar to other limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I shall recount the healing of certain wounds by presenting a reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I shall begin with simple head wounds, for it is fitting that the composition will come to mind at the beginning of chapter three.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 When such an accident occurs in the head and there is no bone fracture: consider then if it is from being struck by stones or similar things, and has already broken skin only: this is a large wound, and apply warm cataplasm to the affected area immediately: do not delay that. And remove the blood outside according to its strength of quality: if there are no prohibitions against phlebotomy, especially if it is little blood coming out from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side to the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And he should guard himself from replenishment, wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 But if something is prohibited for the patient, then lessen intake of food, and not approach meats or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 And place it on a wound if to him an abscess happens, either soaked with warm rose oil alone or mixed with wine that has bindings.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 But if you are safe from a warm abscess, then place it on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood and has not changed in air; after some time, put the powder that I will describe: but if the air has already affected it, then apply some ointment until healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 But if the wound is large or from a cut with a sword, and similar; and its lips are not united by stitches, then join them together with sutures as I will describe in windpipe wounds about their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 But if the wound has already been detected from bone and is hanging, and there is no retraction of it except for a small bandage; then cut into it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then care for the ward with medicines, and restore flesh where there is hard skin; instruct the patient to eat foods that cause bulk, such as heads [of garlic], and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge; similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 But if you find rotting in the skin and it does not stick to bone; then cut out all the decayed part, and remove it; afterwards care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 But if there are arteries or a vein from which blood flows within these wounds; and it is not separated by medicines, then explore over the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 But if you find that it is not cut, then sever it with a spatula or bandage it together.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if necessity arises when it does not yield what we have said; then burn it with a cautery until the blood separates.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 But if these wounds are small and simple; then the matter of them is easy, light: so put powder on that powder: for it solidifies before changing with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 The method for the paste of carne (meat).
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Recipe one part of olive oil, and two parts dragon's blood, and three unquenched lime parts: mix it all together well, and apply to the wound; cover with a good bandage until adhered properly above it, and coagulate with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind the ointment above; remove after a while, but do not wash until it stays in place, so that it does not move away.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 For this medicine must not be removed until healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes it makes the lime alone effective when you don't have olive oil or dragon'wart, and even dragon's blood works in this manner for many large wounds, when to place over them and bind; there are recent wounds with their own blood which do not change air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 But if the air has already changed in some way, especially when it is summer time, then this paste does not stay effective; so treat as we said by putting over it a digestive ointment: or put over it poultices made from barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus comes out.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then continue the rest of the treatment until healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If it happens that there is a break with a small wound, then extract it using leeches; and as I said before, the treatment of skull fractures will be next.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 The injuries of the neck. (This would likely lead into an explanation or method for treating neck inj
Caput LXXXV.	 Head LXXXV. (Another section heading, possibly indicating a
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 But if the wound occurs on the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple head wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 But if it is already cut on the neck or artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no power in it unless you apply treatment that causes strong staunching, such as Zinia and Zeja, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Since worms are harmful and draw them in.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not place anything cold at all upon the wound: for nervous substance is cold and its continuation is with the brain, which is a lofty body of membranes; and it should be cared for by medicines gently, such as calcined lime mixed with sweet water infused every few times with oil or rose-scented oil, and tuthia, when washed also with sweet water; and the remaining mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If however the wound is large, then provide it with stitches: or close its lips with threads.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If however the wound is deep or occurs in a sinus at its lower part where there has already been an accumulation of pus, then perforate it into a more deeply pressed place within that.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 But if already incised in the wound an artery is present and its blood flow has continued: then separate it or cut off that artery, and tie up that very one; or burn it with a hot iron, if there is need for that action.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 But if already the spondyles of the throat have been incised and their nerves healed: then gather together the lips of the skin with stitchangs over the jugular vein, and do not touch the throat, but rather the equal one [i.e., the tongue], and restore it to its natural form.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then bind that wound with a fitting bandage, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound with ointments which have staunching and inflammation-reducing properties until healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 But if the ward has already made an impression on a bone, then explore within that wound: and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all things possible from them or what you can [from] them: and that which is not prepared, let be left alone until the wound rots away, and separates and egresses.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If there is a recent wound, then apply powder on it that has been moistened with water.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If however there is a bone visible in the wound, and it forms an abscess: then heal that one with the method of the chapter where its recollection comes.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 § On the spatula fracture.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a blow with a spear or knife, and you see its depth, then consider the following method.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If therefore there is discharge from the wnid, when he gasps for it and is ill from that, then know that the wound is fatal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If however it is not deep and is recent with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bandages it so that it does not retain blood in its depth and return to the heart, but apply an attracting ointnent on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If however the ointment is not present to you, then place an old cotton wick into the orifice of the wound so that it licks what comes out from it with moisture: and make sure he sleeps on his back over the wound so that whatever collects in it can be drawn away.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If however three days or more have passed since the wound and there is no spasm for him, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor narrowing in breathing, and you see his remaining conditions are good: then know that the wound is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Therefore care for him and with permission, and with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If however its healing is deferred, and it opens always: then know that a fistula has already been formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Therefore care for it according to the chapter's method.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from an incision with a sword or knife, and it is simple on the chest or back surface: then care for it according to that which preceded in its suture, if it is large: or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If it has already made an impression on the bone and broken off pieces from there: then examine the wound, and act quickly to remove those pieces if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If indeed they are not separate, then leave them alone until the wound has started to putrefy; for in fact removing those pieces should be avoided.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 As for the other wounds of accidents in the remaining limbs, that judgment on their healing is the one we have mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 Regarding ventral wounds and those from the intestines and their orifices.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 The disruption which occurs in the abdamen is large, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 Therefore from a major one at times comes out the intestine or multiple intestines. (Note: The original text seems to be discussing hernias and their classifications according to Albucasis' surgical observations.)
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Why there is an intrusion of those, with a stronger and more difficult union. (Note: This likely refers to the challenges faced in reattaching or closing certain types of hernias as observed by Albucasis.)
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 And also a small rupture occurs difficultly from another way. (Note: This sentence suggests that even minor hernias can present complex challenges in surgical repair according
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Thus it follows that the reduction of those is more difficult if you do not hurry to bring them back to their place immediately: because they swell up and open outwards, therefore making an entry of them difficult. (Note: This refers to the urgency required in hernia repair as described by Albucasis; failing to act quickly can lead to complications due to inflammation and enlargement of the rupture site.)
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 For this reason a better (or less complicated) rupture of medium size occurs: because the middle one does not become difficult to reduce like those in both kinds mentioned before. (Note: The sentence is likely comparing different types of hernias and their respective challenges during surgical intervention as per Albucasis' medical expertise.)
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the union of a rupture occurs in four ways (Note: This statement is likely referring to the classifications of hernia repairs based on Albucasto's observations and surgical practices.)
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two common unions join in the abdominal rupture and in other wounds of the body; two other unions properly communicate with remaining wounds elsewhere. (Note: This passage seems to describe different types of surgical closures or suturing techniques as per Albucasis's experience.)
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more suitable with a stitch from the nostril: and I tell you one by one, with exposure, and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, I say that when a wound is full of pus and something comes out from the inside through it, making it difficult to put back together; then this is due to one of two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the displacement as we said: or because there is an inflammamoent in the gut due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 Whenever this is so, then you must heat the wound, such that you immerse a sponge or a piece of wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Or you boil it in an infusion of pennyroyal, and galangal, and saffron, and wrap the gut with it until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes it makes that wine which has astringency; and it is better than water alone for resolving the swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 Thus when you see that the inflammation has already resolved, then moisten the gut with water in which it was boiled along with a high-quality pitcher or bowl.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For by this the mouth of it will be opened again to let out whatever is remaining inside.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 But if there remains a passage after this treatment, then it may be due to a small displacement with the tool used to cut off hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first treatment is better when prepared, than cutting: and it does not force a cut after need and shortcoming of the tool.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 It is a part of it that is curved, sharp-pointed and the other part not pointed, and its tip is not with delicacy similar to gauze, but rather obtuse somewhat; and it is the one which resembles clay as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 For when the wound is enlarged and something enters through it into the gut, then it must be reduced to its own natural shape at its own place if possible over that: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 When indeed a large rupture is on the lower part of the windpipe: then it must be made so that the patient lies on his back and raises his legs higher up to his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is in the upper part of the windpipe, then place its head and make its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if there is a rupture in one of the two parts of the windpipe, then place your aim and always keep your attention to this, so that the part where the wound is should be on the higher side than the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus it must be, that a surgeon deals with large wounds and medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But for small wounds, place them according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make it so that a good and faithful servant holds the entire rupture with his hand: and gather his lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then remove from it whoever follows a stitch something after something: and this is the common method of single suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you take an awl or number of needles according to the amount of the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then dismiss from the edge of the rupture a quantity according to the length of your finger, that is, the doctor: and fix an awl except what you introduce into it thread in both ends of the skin when both ends are cut as it lies under the skin inside until you make it penetrate with the other part, and then you have gathered together two skins' edges, and two sifac edges: and four orders are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then tie firmly with the thread twice around the turning of the needle several times so that both sides are gathered properly.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then dismiss also a thickness of your finger and fix an awl on them too: then lay it with thread as you did with the first neednge.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore, do not cease doing that which you find among the laying-up, until you have completed the closure of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needles be of a medium between thickness and subtleps; for very subtle ones quickly pierce flesh, while thick ones have difficult entry into skin; therefore they should be medium both in subtlety and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not necessary for the needle to be very close to both ends of the skin; so that it does not pierce the flesh quickly and open the wound before its healing, and also they do not elongate with the suture so as to hinder the wound's consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then insert the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the sick person while sleeping; and put on them small pieces from cloths by all sides which hold the ends of the needles: and remove them, when you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And indeed this kind of suture with laying-up is more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 For one or two needles suffice for that kind of suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second common kind of suture is to gather the four ends: two from skin and two tips on one wick with a thread that has been spun evenly both in subtlety and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you will have penetrated with the four ends of the needle, bring back the wick from the part where you first caught it to fall the thread retaken from the upper part of the wound: so that it is a suture like the one which holds cloths together in clothes, and put between all sutures the amount of thickness of little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This kind of suture people know.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this kind of suture I healed my wound that happened to a man whose wound was cut with a knife and it was a larger tear of the skin about one hand-breadth: and had come out from intestines almost two handbreadths from midintestine, and there was disruption in the middle abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 Therefore, I returned that after his intestines had stood outside for twenty-four hours near the wound.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 So the wound was then consolidated after about fifteen days, and I treated it; he recovered from that, and lived for many years thereafter with his own conditions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the doctors judged that it could not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And by a wonder, I did not treat this with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 For I was at the place where no ointment nor anything from medicine could be found.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 So I applied twice a day over the old dressing on the ward and diligently bathed it with water mixed with honey until healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 But two kinds of stitches I shall call according to the speech reported.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is as if you begin with a sharp stitch: and insert an awl from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When therefore the awl pierces through the skin and is inserted into the limb according to its length and breadth of the whole body: dismiss the pointed end into the side where you inserted the awn, and make it penetrate on the other end from the inner part to the outer in the opposite extremity.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When therefore you have made it pierce, then make it pierce according to this in the same extreme from the outer part to the inner: and dismiss the pointed end that is on this side, and make the awn penetrate into the other extreme from the inner part to the outer: and make the awl penetrate with your piercing as you do when you make it pierce through, until it has penetrated entirely into it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also begin from this same side and the extreme with the pointed end that is on another side of the skin, and extract the awl from the skin that pierced it.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then move it to that skin, and sew its extremity which is on the other side, with this extremity of a graft: take out of the skin from that part, and make one incision, and another; and make an incision after the vein, until you have completely removed all external parts according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 And the sum of this suture is such that its stitches resemble those on the skins: so that you remove it with one incision from one part of the extremity of the skin: and let you remove it with another incision from the other part until completed.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 The second kind of proper suture, which Galen called 'nus'.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This manner of healing is described as joining it by similarity to how certain physicians do so that they join all parts according to a suitable comparison: and apply the extremity of grafting to another extremity, and the extremity of the artery to another extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And it is done as I have told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you make the hook near the extremity of the artery close to your external part, and let it pierce into the inside in one piece: and remove both extremities of grafting.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then roll back the hook, and let it pierce from the external part to the inside through two grafting extremities, namely each one.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then roll back both, and also let them pierce from the inside to the outside through two arterial extremities on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is a better common suture than the easy one, and it is a suture that has surpassed memory retention.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 This therefore is also the discourse of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some have said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The suture of a vein with two hooks should be corrected.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 What is done is that you insert into both one thread: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from what is near to you, and make it penetrate until the other side, according to the stitching of their skins which follow equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the windpipe: then the stitching of it is more difficult than those of the remaining places of the windpipe.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 However, the judgment of a wound's treatment is the judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 What is that if you reach a fresh wound with its own blood before it heals: and straighten the intestines, and their flesh, and soften the flesh; then place over the powder of those who are reddened.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 What if the air has already healed the ward: then place over it some ointments that are with you present, until they make pus: and the threads fall down, and bind up the flesh, and mirra.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then attend to this wound as is the care of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 But if you do not have medicine with you, then place over it immediately, and start to extract when it begins to emit pustules: and exchange the flesh twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you will not find medicine with other arrangements when wounds are simple ones.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 But if there are things that communicate the wound to the principal members in a lesion, then it is necessary for you to immerse linen soaked in oil of moderate warmth: and place it around the places between the groin, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 What if it feels pain or pustules or putrefaction in its own bowels (for this often happens) then you should make the flesh a clister with a dark, sticky wine: especially if putrefaction has already come to its intestine, and made an exiting perforation through until concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And you know that what is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and what comes from it, being subtle, is of harder healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 But the intestine called jejunum does not sustain healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of its multitude, which comes from vessels, and their magnitude, and because of the subtlety of its body, and because of the proximity of its own nature to nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 But if what comes from the wound is peritoneum, and you can grasp it freshly: take care to return it according to your technique of evenly reducing the intestines.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 But if a space has passed it and now there is a purulent or black discharge: then it must be that you bind it with a thread over the place where the darkening has occurred from it, so that bleeding does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 For veins and arteries are in peritoneum.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut that which is beyond the ligament, and place two extremities of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so as to relieve you by its attraction towards you, and the extraction of itself in case of peritoneal discharge, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Recollection of a wound that occurred in an intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a disruption in an intestine and it is small: then restoration may occur in some people: therefore, because I saw one who was wounded with his own intestine upon percussion by the lancet, and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and the old wound: and a Fistula was made from it, and emaciation occurred from that discharge, and windiness.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 Therefore I applied a treatment until I was not involved in its healing: neither did it cease being subtle, until it was healed and the site became solidified.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the place already hardened, I feared for the weak one, as an accident had occurred on it due to a sudden illness within himself; and that accident did not happen to him from that cause.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And it remained in better conditions of his own, eating and drinking, having intercourse, and entered the bath, and he continued with his regular meals.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And now some have said from the experimentalists that when an injury occurs to the intestine and it is torn: then one must be tied according to this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 And so you shall receive headless ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then gather two edges of the wound and place one ant from them that has an open mouth over the two edges of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When therefore its head is on it, and it clings with its mouth, detach that head of his, for it sticks and cannot be separated.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing that with ants after each other according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then reduce it, and its wounds.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For indeed these heads remain attached to the intestine until the intestine is eaten and healed, and does not cause deep harm to the sick person.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible for one to tie the intestine even with a fine thread: that which has been removed from the intestine of animals, attached together after being inserted into the anus.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is so that you shall receive the end of this thread from the intestiopathy, and be stretched out much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie at the end of its thread a woundless fine line.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert that thread into the anus and with it his intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then reduce it to a commotion.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of stitching with ants and the intestine is nothing but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a wound that is large, extensive, especially if it is on a slender part of the intestines: then there is no remedy but delicate treatment, and its healing at all is not possible.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Regarding the care for pilonidal cysts and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that any wound or abscess when it ages and becomes old, turns into an ulcer, does not heal, and constantly emits pus without ever separating: then universally in whatever part of the body it was, it is called a Fistula, and we name it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And indeed the Fistula is a truly scrotal filtration, hard and white: with which there is no pain, like down feathers: and because of this some call it Risatio, that is, pen.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And it occurs at certain times wet, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 And perhaps the moisture separates at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And sometimes this moistereness is much, and it is little: and it is thick, and it is fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And I have already mentioned in the division, then when I said wounds, that all ulcers which do not heal and are born into the body, there is none of them but because of one out of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these is because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or due to its illness; or because between it and above its lips there is a hard meat that prevents birth: or since it has many dirtinesses and sordities; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the material that emits from it is of bad quality: or because medicine does not agree in its treatment:n or because there is a falling corruption in the region which is a type of pestilence due to its characteristic as happened in Caesaraugusta: where there are difficult digestions of illnesses, and healing is delayed by nature in apostemas; or because it has one bone, or several bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have already shown you all those causes and signs of them, and the treatments for each with medicines in division; and here it is necessary to make you know the treatment of Fistulas and Piles, which is done through a channel by hand surgery.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, you must know that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For there are fistulas that come to large veins and arterries or nerves or ducts; or to the intestine or bladder or from some of the ribs; or from some of the dorsal spines; or from a composite joint structure: such as hands, feet; and there are those which approach the proximity of primary limbs and their similarities.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 Therefore, of these fistulas, there is one in this manner, which comes from difficult diseases to heal and does not receive treatment, and dealing with it requires great effort and knowledge.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 But if it is of some fistulas whose depth has not reached these places that I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in the healing of its treatment, and wish to achieve knowledge of it, then take a trial from iron or bronze, if the fistula proceeds with straightness, and treat it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 But if there is twisting in a faster, then investigate it with trials of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 For since the softness of lead is taken away by its own malleability, and treated around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 And if a faster has many openings, it is not possible for you to distinguish upon it with trials.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Therefore, filter out of them an opening from their own openangs.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture with which you filter it flows towards other openings and runs through them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then precisely investigate as follows how it may be possible for you to know: whether what is there is a bone or nerve and that the fistula is either long-standing or close by; or if it is one fistula with many openings, and covers the whole of it with great strength of yours: with your questioning as when inquiring about an afflicted person, and finding pain through compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs and causes of accidental occurrences.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when you stand over all of those true positions, then proceed to treatment with confidence: and it is, as you consider at that time, if there is a Fistula near or in a place safe but far from the joints, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you about. Then cut the Fistula according to what has been mentioned above in my narration, and remove what is in it due to filtration, and rotten flesh, which is born at its opening from flesh or pus, and similar things: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 However, if the Fisture is deep and straight, then it must be cut deeply as much as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then cleanse it with all the rotten flesh of its own.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then apply honey-soaked linen to the wound and insert it up to the depth of the Fisture that you enclosed with a knife: do this several times until the acute medicine has completely covered what remains in the concavity of the Fisture from rotting.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with ointments that produce healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 However, if it does not heal by this, then burn it as we have mentioned.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the Fisture is a bone and it appears to be there for you: then examine it, and cut it as I have told you, unless something prohibits you from doing so due to a vein, or nerve, or main limb, just as we mentioned.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If a bone is found by you and there is some rotting and blackness on it, then scrape it off until the entire rotting is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what makes skin cover it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 If it does not heal and emits pus as before, then you know that you have not reached the complete eradication of the infection.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Therefore, remove it a second time and carefully examine its reason and cleanse itself with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If then it heals, it is good; and if not, then you know that the decay is in a very distant part of the body, which you are not connected to.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore, it is not your skill involved unless you allow nature itself.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If the bone of the palate is decayed, and it is possible for you to do so, draw out with subtle pincers that correspond to it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 But if there are many bumps, then carefully perform an extraction of all of them and do not remove anything with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If however something hinders you from the moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in them: then incise those moistures and flesh if they are there, and release the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then place over the wound what is decaying and let it out; and expel that which has become putrid around those bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And guard the wound so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And compress the section which you secured in your procedure.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Indeed place over it if possible, submerged swine's lard beaten with vinegwart: or submerged oil of Egypt, or any green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moistures indeed separate from the bones, let there be removal of them, and their extraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 But if there is a large bone like the thigh bone or hip bone and similar to it, and what has been decayed from it is a great part: then remove that with the last reason until that blackness and decay is taken out.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then he restores the fracture.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If indeed there is something rotten in it and the part is large and the decay has reached the bone marrow, then it must be cut open entirely to where the rot has progressed; then care for it until it solidifies.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you a parable about what happened to the man in his own body: place that example and help over your surgery.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 There was a young man of about thirty years whose body experienced pain in the limb, caused by something that moved within it, namely, from the inside until materials reached the leg and there was a large abscess. And for him there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 Therefore he lasted long with this thing due to the error of doctors until the abscess was opened, and many materials gathered on him at once.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And the care for him was left until a cavity had formed in his leg, and many openings were made therein: all these things released pus and body fluids.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Thus it was cared for by a multitude of doctors for about two years, and there was not in him wisdom in the art of hand until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were running out from those many openings: even the entire body of man had rotted, and the color of his skin was yellowish.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 Therefore I entered with a probe into one of those openings and it reached to the mouth (of the cavity).
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found that they were coming out against him from all parts of his leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I therefore desired it and followed up one of those openings until I extracted a part of the bone: and found that it was rotten: which had already corroded, darkened, putrified, and pierced through until it penetrated to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 Therefore, I made a saw that was discovered and prepared from putrefied bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I assigned it [the piece], which there was no such thing as a portion of the bone except that putrefaction, and cut off and made a saw.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I have already uprooted it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I applied the healing of the wound with well-consolidated medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again and removed the bone above the first discovery: and found continuous putrefaction with the bnne; and a saw appeared to me also from that putrefaction.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 Then I attempted its healing.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 Therefore, I removed again from it [the bone], and did not stop to cut the bone in particular parts, and tried its healing: and it is not restored until I cut about a span of one hand from the bone, and extracted that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I healed it with medicines, and quickly solidified, and healed it: and this repetition was not necessary for its operation, and cutting of itself, except because of the disposition of the debilitated patient, and the small tolerance of his body, and my fear over him concerning death; for in all hours from excessive purging caused a syncopal fall.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 Therefore, he was completely cured by his healing: and a hard bone-flesh has been born in the place of the bone, and made good arrangement in its body, and returned strength to it; and turned back into his usual dispositions: and caused him no harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If however a prominent bnne already has been broken in the place of the body: then it is appropriate that you cut it off, according to this manner; and it is as follows: as if you receive a sash [ligament], and bind it tightly at the tip of the prominent bone: and command someone to stretch it upwards: and lay another ligament from coarse woolen rope.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind the tendon over the meat that is attached to the bone; and extend its extremity so as to draw the flesh downward; and you reveal the flesh over the place where you wish to fasten it, in order not to damage the serrated flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Then place a piece of wood or board underneaturally the bone below; for when you do this, it does not prevent rotten flesh from being cut out.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that the serrated part be placed just above the spot of decay so as not to be deeply within the rotten bone; and it does not appear in its own vision, and prevents the use of another serration.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is decayed and not prominent, but continues with a part of it; and if the decay is within it or on its own part: then remove the flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Afterwards cut that part of the serration where there is decay until it continues on another side; and let the second serration be as close to the length of the decayed area as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the decay is at a joint, cut off the rotten joint and serrate on the bone that continues on another side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 However, if the decay is in the continuity of two joints, then there is no injury to it except scraping away.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the decay is on a hand or foot blade, then the condition there is very difficult indeed.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 However, you must examine how the decay appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And scrape it off and smooth the same as much as possible by any means at your disposebody; when it does not cause you contrary to a Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And you should know that these incisions and serrations for cutting bones are many, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their fineness, and their size, and the degree to which they yield, and their hardness, and their rareness.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, it is necessary for one to prepare an appropriate instrument for each type of surgery.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And you know that these surgerangs require a specific choice of instrument with which you are familiar, especially if your experience is extensive.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And knowledge of the ways of this art, testimony to types of diseases: then you will find for yourself what is suitable from instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I affirm to you the final number of instruments mentioned in this chapter and give examples on which to focus your practice, as well as testing with other tools.
Forma Serrae.	 Shape of saws.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Shape of a different saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Shape of yet another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This shape of the saw is to be made centeredly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Let the arc of it extend upwards and its sharpness from iron: and let the handle be made from boxwood, and may it be centeredly shaped like a pyramid.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Shape of joined scissors.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 The head of this pair of scissors should be shaped like the head of a star thorn: and its points should be according to the shape of Elishafeng's points.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it does not suit unless they rub together with the heads of the scissors when they are corroded or large and broad.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	 Shape of larger pair of scissors.
Forma medii Rasorii.	 Shape of middle pair of scissors.
Forma Rasorii lati.	 Shape of wide pair of scissors.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	 Shape of a pair of scissors with concave heads.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	 Shape of another subtle pair of scissors.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	 Shape of another pair of scissors with a hooked handle.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	 Shape of small, subtle-handled pair of scissors.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	 Shape of pair of scissors with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	 Shape and also of large pair of scissors.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	 This is like a rasp, with its end shaped like a saw; it should be displayed for many places by reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 The shape of the razor that fits to its reason because it is pierced through bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and sharp at the ends.
Fit ex Indi.	 It comes from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And similarly, it should be made as we have described with razors, and saws, and scissors.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 § On cutting the ends and nailing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 The ends rot away due to an external or internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 Therefore, if the doctor has been sickened by that decay and does not apply medical treatment and does not see the decay affecting the limb to which nothing is applied: then it is necessary to cut off that limb up to where the spread of decay occurs so that the weak one may avoid death or a greater defect in the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And the sign of which is that the limb darkens until thought to be dead; it has been burnt by fire or has decayed after blackening: then this putrefaction cuts up to where it follows the limb and creeps through the entire body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Therefore, when it has been cut off and similarly if the cause of decay is from some venomous things such as sea scorpions, adder-heads, blister beetles, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the decay or impact is on the end of a finger, then cut off the finger and do not leave space for the spread of decay so that it may be incised up to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens on a hand, then cut off that hand from the root of the elbow and do not leave space for the spread of decay until it reaches into the cubital fossa.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it invades that one, then cut off the arm near the elbow at its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 But if the decay passes through and you see it around the elbow: then there is death to that patient.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And in addition to this from treatment, there is a quantity of strength.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 Similarly, do so with the foot when there is a corruption in the finger, then make an incision near one of the knots; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then make an incision along the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 However, if it rises to the knee, then make an incision near the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 Which if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy for it, unless release, and to leave the sick person to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the way of making an incision or cutting the limb is to stretch the lower tendons which you intend to cut; and stretch another tendon above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And extend one servant ligament towards below: and extend another servant ligament upwards from above.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between two ligaments with a wide spatulum until all the meat is revealed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then make an incision or cut.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary to place a linen strip from all the parts of the skin, and that it does not touch the healthy joint: and if there be an additional injury to the sick person, and hot suppuration.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 However, if there is an internal bleeding while you work on it, then quickly cauterize the place or put some powders that stop the blood over it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then bind the wounded limb with a corresponding ligament and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you about what happens to a man in his own foot, this same thing that I told you about.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 Which is because it happens as a redness in his own foot with an erosion that resembles the burning of fire; and this corruption first happens in his finger until it begins to affect the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore, a man took care of himself after he saw the corruption set in on his limb with great weakness, which he found from pain and burning; and it happened at the joint, and was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed for him, the same corruption occurred on his thumb of the hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 So he came to me, and I tried to recover the excess from him with what I had applied to his hand after cleansing his body; but the excess was not found, and it began to occur on another finger: until a corruption occurred on his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 Therefore, he called me to set his hand; and I did not want to do that, hoping for the excess from him to be found with me: and also feared death upon him at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 For the man's strength was greater than the matter.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 But after he had given up on me, he returned to his land; and came to me because of that, and his hand was entirely severed: but he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 And I did not bear this story unless it be help for that which falls from the nature of this sickness; and that it may have significance as signified, and according to how it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 Of the care of sinuses, and the quality of clysters with medicines.
Caput XC.	 Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When an abscess occurs on certain fleshly members and continues for a space of time until it forms a collection of pus; then it breaks out or is perforated, and that which was in there comes forth from the sore: and the skin above remains like a cloth already thinned out: and healing did not reach to its end in corruption, nor impressed on bone, nor nerve, nor ligament: it should be called Sinus; and is not called Fistula. But if the space of that extends until the corruption impresses on something from among those members, then it is named a Fistula or Zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its treatment is to incise the skin completely as it heals; especially when it becomes thin and spreads like cloth; and trust that it does not adhere with the bone because of its decay.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 But if you hope that the skin will adhere and not result from that final decay; and if there is thickness in the flesh of the skin, then treat it with an enema; and consider applying a compress.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large and pus is emitted from it with foul odor; then enema the wound with an Egyptian medicine consisting of equal parts vinegar, oil, and zinziri, which are mixed into a bag: and boil them on fire until they turn red, and let them come to the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what you need from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and enema the wound with that medicine for an interval of two hours; and tighten the opening, and discharge the medicine into it at a quantity equal to two hours' time.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then extract from it with expression for so many days until the wound is cleansed and the odor disappears.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 And occasionally enema it with water and ashes when this medicine is not present to you; and take the ash of willow twigs or oak wood shavps: and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then cool it with that, and enema the wound with it until you trust that the wound is already washed out.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 But if the patient cannot bear the Egyptian medicine or ashes water, then enema the wound with water and honey mixed with some of the crushed zinziri.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or enema the wound with honey and wine mixed together since of the nature of honey is to cleanse and wash; and make the wine adhere to the wound, especially when there is an excess of spitting power and dryness in it.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 Whenever you do this and with clysters because the sinus corruption has already been removed, then cleanse it as such that meat is born from it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is that you receive from the dyafinicum ointnment: and dissolve it with rose oil, and astringent wine; or cleanse it with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 But if the sinus opening is tight, into which a clyster tube does not enter: then enlarge it with iron slightly: or place into it soaked linen in an Egyptian ointnment, or in a Basilicum ointment, until it has been widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly if it is also a wide opening, then join its lips with suture: and let the quantity taken from there be used for making clysters without any additions.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly if the opening from which a discharge runs is elevated to the upper parts: then cut it off at the lower part that is there, so that the discharge runs out through it downwards; for when the pus is constricted deep within the sinus, it prevents meat from forming in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 But if it is not possible for you to cut the sinus about lower towards which way you wish: then try as best you can to prepare the member with preparation by means of which a discharge flows out from there easily according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 And try as best you can that nothing at all remains within it from the discharge; and take solidifying medicines which are indicated on the signs, suitable to what is desired by you.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the linen cloth be of such quantity that it makes contact with the whole sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then incise with scissors along the opening of the sinus's aperture, slightly wider than the opening of the sincus itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then extend the ointment lumps onto another piece of cloth according to the amount of openings: and place it on top far away from the sinus opening so that the pus may be drawn out from there: and do not remove the large cloth too quickly, but after a few days only.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 But he who is above the sinus opening, he whom you remove every hour so that what accumulangs in it from pus may flow out: and to know, whether the thing that comes out of there is much or little; digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And when you again consider the location of that sinus itself, whether its master feels pain there or not; and whether there is a sore or not in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 Thus when your treatment is stretched out in this manner and you see the matter that flows out over the sinus opening, then know if the sinus already adheres or approaches adhesion: then accordingly loosen it in the morning or on the third day: and when you unbind a sore, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 But if a long and subtle virus flows out from the sinus, do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing approaches, because there are men who delay tissue generation in their sores, and among them are those who act otherwise about it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 But if a long and subtle virus flows out from the sine after many days of undigested pus, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 But if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and prolonged, then add more drying agents as such; make sure that there are enough moist medicines for them to be wet by nature, and dry by their power: like dyafinicon ointment, when added with an excess of substance from wax.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from this, when he is treated more extensively, it is so that you receive the diaphinic unguent, and dissolve it with rose oil, and stirred over an old wine equal to its nature.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then make of it [the poultice], as such, use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now you do a similar to this action, when the diaphinic unguent is not present with you [at hand], honey; when you cook it, until it swells, and use it as such.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or receive [myrrh], and aloe, and frankincense; break the whole thing into pieces, and pulverize it over honey while it is on fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then place the thread over it [the wound], and bind the bandage over Shadon; and place the honey that you have cooked until it swells, and sprinkle it over the pieces, and put them on top of the fabric, and tie the bandage onto it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes it is administered with that [long-leaved] aristolochia and the roots of the heavenly lily and onion; and flour of a plant, and cornflower.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use them with simple [remedies], or combined ones; crush it and the same sieve, and sprinkle it over honey that you have prepared, and use it as such.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the wound continues and is not healed by this treatment: then you know that there is a deep-seated [infection] in it; or now it has made an impression on bones, or other hard limbs, or ligaments: then treat it with a method of Fistulas, as previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 Of the treatment of Panaretus and worn nail, and incision on an added finger, and cutting [the tissue].
Caput XCI.	 Head 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Panaretus is an abscess that arises under the thumb of hand or foot; and perhaps it may arise on other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 Therefore, when the matter of its wound is prolonged and neglected in care and exposed to warm moisture, it becomes corrupt or discharges pus until it destroangs the root of the nail; and perhaps it may become entirely rotten, and perhaps the rot may reach the mouth, until a foul odor emanates from it; and its extremity becomes wide, and its color turns dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 Therefore, when you care for it as we have said in the division and your treatment does not succeed: then it is necessary that you cut out with a knife all the excessive matter remaining from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then burns (cauterizes) the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 For indeed, cautery is very useful for them all.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 But if the bone is sound and the nail also healthy, and the dry additions of the nail are already compressing the flesh towards the interior, and they begin to prick it, and injure it: then one must place a subtle radium under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and press it upwards; and cut away the flesh with ease, and put over what remains from the flesh burned medicines, corrosives, until it is entirely removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 But if the rot already imprints on the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract the matter: for it does not heal at all as long as there remains rottenness in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 But if you see erosion and rottennamenews to be advancing on the finger, then cut it off at a node as mentioned earlier.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 But if there happens to be abrasion of the nail or a blow: and it causes intense pain, then one must first draw blood from the sick person.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then she cuts a piece of wax with an obliquely sharp spatula across from below to above the eye.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And guard so that the incision does not reach the flesh undernehemal wax, for it may happen with great pain to the patient through this injury and cause additional body tissue growth at the site.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then care for the place so that it calms pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 Yet the finger that is added which grows on certain people's hands, maybe it is all flesh; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps it has a wax-like substance: and some of them grow at the root joint, or its growth occurs on some knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore the one that grows on certain finger knots does not move: and the one that is born at the joint of a finger, perhaps it moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Thus the one among them that is fleshly, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 What I mean to say: as you cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 However the treatment of the one whose growth is at the joint's root is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore beware of incision on it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 Yet for the one that grows in a finger among the last knots, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then scrape the bone with a single of those scrapers appropriate for that purpose.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Yet the solidification that occurs on fingers' tips often happens from birth with it, or from wound healing, or burning with fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore you should cut off that solidification until the finger returns to its natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place between them linens dipped in rose oil: so that they do not solidify quickly, and separate them: or put between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place is healed according to what it should be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	 And similarly, if such a hardening occurs with certain fingers along with the palm, then cut off that hardening, according to how it is prepared and fits the shape of the body part.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 On Surgical Errors.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 These are distended veins which occur with excessive melancholamoia in many body parts; and most of the event occurs in legs, especially in legs used for walking and working, and carrying loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary to administer body friction from black cholera several times through vigorous rubbing.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then the leech should latch onto those veins of the patient's basilic (arm).
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 However, the cure for these is in two ways with iron.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One of them involves cutting and extracting black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 And the other method is to drain the vein and remove it entirely.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The cutting of that (vein) is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 First wet the leg with warm water a lot until the thick and dirty blood dissolves.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then tightly bandage that leg from its upper thigh area to the lower part of the knee with strips.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Next cut (the leech) off at a single place or two places, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then drain (the blood), that is, extract the blood into your hand from the lower part of the leg to the upper and first attach leeches to the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut off the skin with its lower part: until a quantity of blood sufficient to what you see is expelled and as much can be endured by the patient's strength.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Then bind the wound and instruct him to refrain from foods that generate black cholera: and repeat evacuations and leeching when veins fill up, and if it bothers the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The leeching however is done according to this manner.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 Then apply a dressing if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then insert the fat into a bath: or prick the flesh with a hot needle while in contact with warm water until it turns red and swells, or exercise vigorously if there is no available bath, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then dry the skin directly on either side of the veins along their length: or at its end near the knee, or at the lower part by the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with a hook and remove the veins from all sides until they are visible; and at their appearance, you see them turning red to blackish color.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 Thus when it comes out of the skin, you see it white as a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert under that radius until when leeching and coming out of the skin; hang it with a clean hook gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then dry another incision close to the first one by three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape away the skin from above part of the vein until it is visible.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then leech with radii as you did first; and hang it with another hook as you did initially.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then dry another incision or several if required.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then leech and cut the same final incision near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then extract it from the incision above that one.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you extract it from the incision above or all higher cuts when they come out entirely; then cut them.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If however it does not yield to be extracted and leeched: then insert a needle with a strong thread twice, tie it off, and extract it; or insert under that radius; and relax your hand over all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And let it heal, so as not to cut again.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, then it will be very difficult for you to completely heal it, and harm will come from the injury itself.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when you have removed it completely: then place a cloth soaked in wine and rose oil (or oil) over the wound, and care for it until healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is twisted, having a tortuosity that requires an extension into different parts, and it is not like we said according to straightness: then you must make cuts over its entire tortuous part, and the locations of the extensions themselves.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with a hook until completely healed: and let the surgical cuts heal without being reopened or injured again; for it will be very difficult to heal them or remove them.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Therefore, use your caution.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The form of the incident in which a vein is cured.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The form of blinding hooks (cauterization).
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not as thin or sharp as other hooks, nor does it have acute tips that could reopen wounds; and it has a thick flexibility, softness: because if it were subtle, its own subtlenebility would cause the wound to reopen: indeed let there be an excess of bulkiness on it, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 Regarding the removal of a leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is found on the legs in hot lands like Elisegi and Arabian territories, as well as on dry, somewhat warm lands where not a single plant or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it arises in other places of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 And indeed the occurrence of this vein is due to decay that happens underneteh skin, like how it occurs inside bodies with snakes and ascarids worms, and worms born between skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And the sign of the onset of this vein's event is that it occurs with intense inflammaturation within the muscle.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then, the bleeding point.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then begins the vein to exit from that place of bleeding, as if it were a root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When it then appears from that end of it, one should insert over the same piece of lead weighing as much as a keil-drachm up to two drachms and its length: and remove the suspended lead from the muscle.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 As often as it then proceeds something to the exterior, insert that into lead and its length.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it is prolonged much, then incise that part of it, and insert the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut its root until it has emerged entirely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 For if you cut it, it contracts, and enters into the flesh; and makes a bleeding occur, and decay in place, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore it must be gently handled and drawn out gradually, until it leaves from its end completely, and nothing remains of it in the body: and this vein emerges in some humans that is in length five spans and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now comes to me because he has come out from twenty spans.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 But if you have incised yourself at the time of your medical treatment: then insert a rod into its hole and perforate it through the hole long, with the body, until that completely evacuates which is in it from material: and administer decay to place with medicinal days for some.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then care for itself at treating of sores.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of foot, or on the foot itself: and there occur to it many holes, and a branch comes out from every hole.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore, take care of it as we have discussed in the division, and with what has been previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 Regarding the section on worms generated under the skin, which is called Bouin'tise.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This disease is called Bouintise in a certain land among us; therefore, because it often happens to oxen and consists of a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it proceeds through the entire body, ascending and descending; and it is shown to affect the sensation during its movement from limb to limb until it ruptures wherever it bursts into the skin, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation comes from the decay of certain fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 Just as worms and snakes occur, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in urine.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it fears from its evilness.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when it proceeds through the body and ascends to the head, and reaches a place; then perhaps it opens up there, and emerges, and destrocks an eye: and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 Therefore, when one takes care of it, and extracts it, then that is not done except during its movement, and the appearance itself of its sensation.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 One should therefore hold tight what is above it, and what is below it with a strong binding pressure.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then dry over it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it is deeply embedded in the flesh, and you do not find it: then place a caustic over that spot with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And greater still is its decay, which ruins the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then tightly tie underneath a strong ligature on the eyebrow.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above it and extract [it].
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And one must use a sick person'score self-cleansing with medicines that dissolve foul and bad bodily fluids.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 And he should beware of foods that cause putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 § On cutting above the sickness Nakir.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This illness is called Nakir on our land: it is pain that occurs in certain limbs; and then it moves from one limb to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And indeed I have seen this myself, as you told me.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 Called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she extracted her arm, and I saw swelling like honeycombs on the line of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And after I stayed for an hour, I saw one swelling advance like a waxing with jets, as it ascends to her arm faster than it can be: so that it is like silver moving from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore the pain receded from that place and settled on the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then I sat for an hour, and ran through the rest of her body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her entire body as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 Therefore I wondered about the rapidity of its movement from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed I myself had not seen this kind of sickness with my eyes in such a way before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 But I did see many others who find pain moving from limb to limb: and I did not see this with my eyes as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that is the case, but because she was from those who are coming out of parched bodies with wounds: hence therefore it appears to be a change of air movement.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reasoning in those who are pleasing and in moist bodies of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 Therefore, when you apply this treatment and the patient feels that pain: if it appears to your eye as we said, then tighten above it, and below immediately: cut on top of it quickly, until that swelling is drawn back; and cauterize the spot.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it by rubbing the body, and that which expels swellings, and compresses them with loathsome pills, and serepta-like pulses, and similar ones.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 § On extracting arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Chapter 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrows differ according to their kinds and the places where they fall from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 Their variety is such: for there are some that have large points, and small ones: and hollowed, and deafened.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And there are some which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And there are those which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And there are some that have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 However, those that fall into certain limbs, it is in two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 Or indeed the limbs are from major parts hollowed out, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Whenever one of these limbs falls and you see signs of death which I will tell you after this, then it is necessary for you to avoid extracting that arrow from them, since death follows the place where it is located, by many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when you do not see these bad signs and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 Therefore, when a person is hit by an arrow that penetrates the skull and exits through the top of the head (which lies above the brain), these symptoms occur: because of this, there are intense pains, blindness, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of thoughts, and vomiting due to cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood may exit through the nostrebs or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And speech may be severed, and voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And a whiteness like lime may exit from the wound site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And there is an exudation similar to moist flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 However, if these signs appear to you, then refrain from healing it and extract the arrow only if it does not exit on its own.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of an arrow hitting the heart are as follows: that is near the left nipple; and it feels as if it is fixed to something hard, not to something soft.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps the arrow moves like a pulse movement: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 Then follows that coldness of limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting spells.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know then that death is close by no doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 And the sign of an arrow hitting the lung is that frothy blood exits from the wound: and thin things follow it on the neck, spreading out, and changing to a pale color of the sickly.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 And there is a large, deep breath; and seeks cold air attraction.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls on the casing (which is in the chest): then it is close to bare ribs: and there is a large short breath with intense pain, with sighing: and all limbs move tremulously.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls on the stomach, then perhaps something undigested food will exit from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 And if an arrow falls into the abdab, and becomes fixed therein: something of feces comes out from the wound, or a splinter, or entrails that are already torn apart.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore, there is no hope for his healing, nor for extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If an arrow falls into the bladder and discharges urine: and something proceeds to the outside, with stronger pain in the afflicted person: then you know that it is fatal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 However, the remaining parts such as the face, neck, throat, tongue, palate, arms, cervical vertebrae, shoulder blades, hip bones, legs, and similar limbs are saved according to several dispositions when it is not found that an arrow has reached an artery or nerve: and it is not a venomous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I have seen of these kinds of arrows that signify by means of your healing.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 Which is, because a certain man was struck with an arrow in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore, I extracted it from one side under the fatty part of his ear: and he was healed, and no harm came to him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell on him in the fatty part of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow had already been hidden, and I did not extract anything except a small scale of it that was attached to its wood: and it was a large arrow like those used by Turkish archers, made with soft iron, without ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 Therefore the Jew was healed, and no harm befell him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from a Christian's throat.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 And it was an Arabian arrow, and it is the kind that has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 Therefore I stitched it between the two guides: and it was already submerged into his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 So I carefully handled it until I removed it: and he, a Christian, was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow that had fallen into his belly: and we thought it would die from this.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 Afterward, however, for him passed thirty days, and nothing changed about him from his conditions, so I stitched over the arrow: and healed it with skill, and extracted it: and he was hewed, and no misfortune happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw the men whose back had an arrow wound: and it was healed over that wound.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 Afterward, however, after seven years, an arrow came out of his hip joint.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman whose belly had an arrow wound, and it was healed over that ward; and the arrow remained within her: and nothing changed from her conditions, and she found no harm to him through any of her natural processes.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man whose face had an arrow wound; and it was healed, but the arrow remained, not finding him much pain: and like these many similar things.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's leaders, which had fallen into his nose; and it was already leaning slightly toward the right side: and the arrow was wholly hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 I was called to heal him after the arrow incident for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 And I found a wound from an arrow that was very narrow.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 So I carefully tried to probe it, and did not feel it; but he himself found bleeding and pain on the right side of his ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 So I hoped that was a perforation from the arrow's tip.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 Therefore, I placed the plaster with the emplastros where the attraction and digestion were present, confident that the place was targeted, and it appeared to me as a sign of an arrow, so I cut above it: and nothing happened at the location intended to signify that an arrow had struck the spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 Therefore, I applied the emplastros on it for many days: and nothing happened unexpectedly, and the wound was healed in the meanteby: and remained weak from the extraction of that time until he sensed an arrow one day within his nostrils.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me about it.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore, I placed an acute and caustic medicine on that wound for many days until it was open, and when I tried to touch it myself, and felt the slight point of an arrow attached to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added to the opening of the wound with that acute medicine until we could visibly see the point of the arrow: and it passed for me from him a period of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then, after the wound had been enlarged and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, and it did not yield exit: then I did not cease delicately and skillfully trying ways of ingenuity on it until one day with properly made forceps, according to how the shape of them comes in the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed the physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not repairable.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 Therefore I restored it and the wound was healed and the patient's health was completely intact: nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of extracting certain arrows: place that rule and significance over what I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts and distinabtions of this art are not comprehended with the narration: neither does that book comprehend it, and a wise craftsman compares little to much: and what is absurd, he compares to what is absent; and in doing so, he found a new operation and a new instrument for the descent of foreign bodies in this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 Therefore, I say that arrows do not exit from the members with which they are embedded unless by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or through attraction from the place it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or conversely, parts of another.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which exits where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into the fleshy area: and it is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 That if it does not obey the exit at the hour when it falls: then one must cast it away for several days until the flesh around it decays: and its attraction is reduced and its exit occurs.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if it is fixed in bone and does not obey you for the exit, then cast it away also for several days: and touch it daily with attraction and movement on every day until its exit occurs.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 That if it does not obey you for the exit after days, then one must pierce around the path of the arrow in that bone from every side with a subtle drill until the arrow is enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then attract it and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 But if the arrow is fixed in skull bone and has already proceeded into one brain ventricle, and some of those things I mentioned seem to be ill: then refrain from attracting the arrow, and cast it away until its state after days is equalized.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 For if the arrow proceeds into the brain, then death does not extend to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except in bone bodies only and does not penetrate up to the brain: and remains sick for several days, and none of those things happen to him: then use your mind on attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 However, if it is firmly fixed and does not yield to traction: then insert a needle around the area of the arrowhead, as for closing a wound; then treat the place until healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 However, if the arrow is already concealed within the body and hidden from sense: then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 However, if you feel it, then draw it out with certain instruments that suit its traction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 However, if you cannot get over it due to the constriction of the wound and because of the depth of the arrowhead and there is no bone, nerve, or vein: then find above it, until the wound enlarges, and as far as possible extracting the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 That if there are ears that hold it fast, then liberate the fixed flesh from all sides by every means you can, and instruments, if it cannot be brought above the injury of a broken or twisted ear, until he flees.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And you when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any place where it is, then use your hand's contortion with scissors to all parts until he flees: and by subtlety lastly, so that the arrow does not break, and makes difficult its attraction and extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 That if you cannot get over it at once, then let it go for several days until what is around him becomes putrid.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then repeat it: for if the blood flow causes you trouble, then administer what we have said from healing in its chapter: and guard your strength from injury of veins, nerves or cords.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer the instrument in every way you can for the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease, calmness, delay, firmness, as I have narrated to you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And you must make it so that when drawing the arrow, the patient is weakened according to its shape, as was during the case of the arrow wound itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 Since there are more pains.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 But if it is not possible for you to do that, then give what you can from the patterns.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the other part, or is already causing something on the outside: it makes swelling at the extremity of the arrow due to a sense from the nearby upper skin; and you see it protruding: cut above it, and let the incision be according to the amount that hands can hold in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull on it; for it is indeed easier for an exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 But if it is held in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow impresses into the beak, and enlarges itself: then pull on it.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: discharge it for a few days; then repeat it until it exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 But if the arrow's wood is in that area, then push on it with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 But if the wood falls and you need to apply a push: then insert an instrument with a hollow end so that it can enter into the tail of the arrow: then push on it with that.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	 But if the arrow is hollow, then push on it with an entering instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow indeed is removed by this.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 For if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary for you to make a hollow all through the flesh wherein is the venom, if possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then take care of it with what suits that matter.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 For if the arrow falls into the heart, or in the bladder, or on the side: and it is near what you touch with your hand when you try to do that, and possible for you to cut above it: then cut above it, and cauterize from the incision of the vein or nerve, and extract it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then examine the wound, if possible, and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of Forceps, with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The ends are like an eagle's beak, crafted as if of iron: when they catch the arrow above it, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And many kinds are made from them, large and small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its penetration depth, the width of the wound, and its tightness.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The shape of a lever is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the shape of a lever is convex.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is like the end of the radius, to be inserted into the concave arrow, and pushed together with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The end of this concave lever is concave like an eagle's quill: to be inserted into the arrow and its push.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	 § On venipuncture.
Caput XCVII.	 Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	 The points to be punctured for venipuncture, of which it is customary practice on the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	 Of which on the head are sixteen: two Pulse Veins, called post-ear veins; two Herb Veins (veins near the temples); two Arteries, visible between the temples; two Eyebrow Veins, situated in front of each eye and named Aspikents; a prepared Vein on the forehead; and a Vein at the tip of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	 And two Jugular veins, which are located on the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	 And two Veins that are situated above the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	 And two Veins that are located below the lower lip of the mouth.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	 And these are Veins called Algerrichs.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	 And two Veins that are situated under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	 The veins which are punctured for venipuncture on both arms are five per arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	 One is cephalic and is from the silvery side; and the common people call it vein of the head.
Et Fusca.	 And black.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	 It is a middle vein and is composed of branches from the basilica and cephalic; the common people call it the body's vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	 And it is called the basilica, and is located on the domestic side; it is also named Titillicaris.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	 And the common people call it the vein of winds.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	 And it is called the funis brachii, and is located above the armpit; that is where bloodletting occurs, and it is also the one that appears prominently with thumb movement.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	 And Salutaresia: and it is a vein that is between the ring finger and little finger; there are two branches to it.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	 And there are three veins in the leg and foot.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	 One of them is under the curve of the thumb from the silvery side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	 And the second one is Saphene, and its location is near the heel on the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 And it is a vein of Nessus, and its location is near the heel from the silvery side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	 And there are three similar veins on the other leg.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	 § Of bloodletting from two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	 However, the bloodletting from two veins that are after the ears is for old coughs, and hemicrania, and sore throat, and ancient head ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	 And the quality of bloodletting her as I will describe.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	 It is done to the head of the sick person: and it rubs gently his occiput at the place where the two veins are with a piece of rough cloth for good scraping.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	 Then the sick person binds their neck with bandages until they appear as two veins.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	 And the locations of those are after the ears, on lower places of the head in two places.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	 Therefore ask for those veins with your finger, and where you feel a pulsation under your finger, there mark with wax.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	 Then take the lancet called Incisor.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	 Then insert a sponge under the skin, until it reaches with the lanclete to the mouth (vein).
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	 Then use your hand with a sponge and skin towards the upper part, and cut the vein together with the incision made by Incisor.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	 And let the length of the incision be equivalent to two fingerbreadths or about that amount; and make it exit through blood as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	 Then tighten it with bandages, and let it go until healed.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	 And now the first part of the book has passed concerning cutting these veins and their cauterization.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	 § On the phlebotomy of two arteries on the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	 However, the two arteries that are in both temples for phlebotomy have benefit to old headaches: and frequent sweating, and persistent otitis; and discharge of hot fluids into the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the quality of performing it is as follows as I inform you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	 The sick person should tightly bandage their neck until two veins appear clearly to the sense of sight; and it shows pulse under your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	 Then mark with wasters.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	 Then use a sponge on the vein to the upper part with your index finger, and insert an incision undernephesisthe lancet, and use a sponge on the vein again to the upper part.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And cut it as you did with other two veins; and let it run out of blood according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	 Then loosen the bandage on the sick person, and place your finger over one of the veins for a while.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then place a bandage and poultices on it, and wrap the wound tightly with a strong binding; release it once healed.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	 And now follows the recollection of those, their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae frontis post phlebotomiam Cephalicae.	 § Of bloodletting on the forehead after cephalic bloodlettnig.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae uenae frontis est post phlebotomiam Cephalicae, ad aegritudines faciei antiquas: et ad hemigraneam, et rubedinem: et ulcera foeda.	 However, the bloodletting bandage on the forehead is after cephalic bloodlettning: for ancient diseases of the face; and headache; and redness; and foul sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And the nature of that bloodletting is as I have told you.
Coartet infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareat uena.	 A sick person should tie their neck with a poultice until the bandage appears.
Deinde accipe instrumentum quod nominatur Fossorium.	 Then take an instrument called Fossa.
Cuius haec est forma.	 Which is its form.
Pone acumen eminens quod est in capite Fossorii super ipsam uenam, et percute super ipsum cum pectine, aut cum re alia in modo eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere secundum quantitatem quam uis.	 Place a prominent point that is on the head of Fossa above the bandage and strike over it with a comb or with another tool in its manner; and release blood running according to the amount you wish.
Deinde solue perforationem infirmi, et stringe eam, donec sanetur.	 Then dissolve the puncture of the sick person, and bind it tightly until healed.
Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	 And sometimes it is opened with a wide bloodletting.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	 However, it should not be a sharp bloodletting as the others are; but rather one of wide extremities at its base.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And the bloodletting is as follows: for the mouth is close by; and perhaps it breaks when the bloodletting is fine.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 § Of bloodletting of the Veins on two Lacrimals.
Iuuamentum autem duarum Venarum quae sunt in duobus Lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, est ad oculum ex scabie et rubedine: et sebel in oculo, et aegritudinibus faciei.	 However, the bloodletting bandage of two Veins that are on two Lacrimals for both eyes is for an itch and redness; and within the eye, and diseases of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta.	 And the nature of that bloodletting is as a sick person should tie their neck with a poultice.
Deinde phlebotoma eas: et tu sis stans super caput eius.	 Then use a fleam and stand over his head.
Et fiat phlebotomia secundum transuersum ad longitudinem parum, cum phlebotomo paruo, lato parumper, nam in loco non est caro.	 And let the bleeding be carried out transversely along a bit of length, with a small fleam slightly wide, for there is no flesh at that spot.
Si enim phlebotomus est subtilis extremitatis, fortasse frangitur.	 However, if the fleam is too thin at the end, it may break.
Deinde fac currere ex sanguine quantum est tibi necesse.	 Then let the blood flow as much as you need to.
Et pone super eas cotum, et stringe eas nocte una, et solue eas.	 And place a dressing over them and bind it tightly for one night, then loosen.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Nasi.	 § On bleeding the veins of the nose.
Venae autem Nasi phlebotomia, est conferens ad febrem acutam, et sodam uehementem, et aegritudines faciei, sicut hemigraneam, et rubedinem quae accidit in facie: praecipue quando est antiqua.	 The veins of the nose for bleeding provide relief from acute fever, strong headache, and facial pains such as migraines, and redness that occurs on the face; especially when it is old.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringat infirmus collum suum.	 And its quality of bleeding is to tighten an ailing neck.
Deinde tene nasum eius manu tua sinistra, et accipe phlebotomum subtilem, longum: et fige eum in medio leporis ipsius, inter illud quod distinguit nasum secundum rectitudinem.	 Then hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long fleam; and fix it in the middle of the lobe itself, between that which separates the nose at right angles.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 For there is no vein apparent to touch, and because blood starts flowing immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 And you must hold the fleam with your last hand slightly wide: and let the blood flow as much as needed by you.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bind it for one night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it is restored quickly indeed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 § On bleeding the veins of Guido.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	 Two of Guido's bleeding methods provide relief from an asphyxia, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic pains, impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrosives; that is, with epithelial worms.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est ut stringat infirmus sub utrisque in collo suo cum ligamento: et stet artifex super caput infirmi, et infirmus sit sedens super sedem.	 And the quality of those bleedings is to tighten an ailing under both arms with a bandage: and that the skilled person stand over the head of the sick man, and let the sick man be sitting on his seat.
Deinde phlebotoma uenam ad longitudinem phlebotomia ampla parumper.	 Then a lancet is taken for the length of a wide phlebotomy.
Deinde extrahe ex sanguine quantitatem temperatam, aut secundum illud quod uides ex necessitate quae est ad illud.	 Then one extracts from blood an amount that has been moderated in temperature or according to what you see is necessary for it.
Deinde fac similiter de uena alia.	 Then do similarly with another wine.
Postea solue ligamentum, et stringe duas uenas strictura media: ut non praefocetur infirmus.	 Afterwards dissolve the ligament and tighten two wires at the midpoint of the narrowing so as not to overwhelm the weakened [tissue].
Et dimitte eam usque mane.	 And release it completely by morning.
Sanatur enim uulnus.	 For indeed a wound is healed.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 § On the phlebotomy of veins according to Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 But the phlebotomy of veins according to Algeberer is as follows: because it contributes to intoxication through the mouth and decay of the gums, and bad sores; and cracks at the lips, and bad sores also that are on the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of those phlebotomies is such as to make him sit weak before you: and fasten his neck with cuffs.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then roll back his lip and look at two wires: one is on the right side of his lip, and the second is on the left side of it; and the indication for each [wire] is by a black dye of amber.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true: because around those wires there are small veins that are black.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Therefore cut both [wires] with an incision made on the [wire].
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 But if there is doubt about you and you do not know which those are: then look at the larger of them and their clearer [location].
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly do with the two wires that are on the upper lip, and especially it is customary with him: and cut two veins that are on the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 § On the phlebotomy of the vein under the tongue following the Cephalic [vein] phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 But the quality of the two veins under the tongue that are [veins] for phlebotomy: is because the Cephalic [vein] phlebotomy contributes to pre-chewing and swelling in the throat, and ailments of the uvula, and afflictions of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the manner of performing phlebotomy is such that the sick person sits between your hands in front of the sun: and examine his tongue from one side, and examine it from the other side: and the color of both sides darkens to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Therefore on either side; and guard them so that you do not harm with your hands while performing pheblotomy.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For beneath it there are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood may occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Concerning three veins on the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The veins that are bleeding from the elbow, called for their phlebotomy which has run its course among all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And such phleebotomy is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or by piercing with a broad myrtle leech; or by oil to dryness of coloration; or by cutting with a knife-shaped leech, and it is called Anesileu.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus Anesileu is, which suits to cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from them are kinds wide and subtle according to the width of veins and their narrowness: The form of a myrtle leech for phleebotomy is wide as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it suits to open shallow veins, full, proceeding, apparent, thick and those which contain viscous blood, cloudy.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this leech for phleebotamony is of lesser width, and more slender at the ends.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it suits to phleebotomy for veins thin, which contain a subtle lemon-colored blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Concerning the great phlebetomy.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 And yet there is a kind of these three veins' phleebotamony called great.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 For it extracts blood from illnesses that are under the throat and neck, from what follows the chest, and windpipe: and such a phlebotomist with a leech should be cautious, for above is an artery beneath it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 If therefore he is wrong and makes a hole near the vein, he pierces the artery, and blood flows out.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, it is necessary that when puncturing her (the vein), she not be pierced with the vein being punctured by the phlebotomist: rather let him cut deeply with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 But if the Basilica does not appear with a clearly manifested apparition, then it is necessary to seek out strangers and change her, or ask for another branch of hers; replace them with veins in place of those punctured by the phlebotomist.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 For she is indeed manifest and cuts her (the vein) with an Alneser as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 But if you desire her own vein puncturing instrument, then before the straining of the arm, touch (the area) until you discern where the pulse is located.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then indicate signs above (the place) with an incrustation, afterwards the arm and cut a shallow section there with an Alneasel as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And be careful that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you are straining the bandage, swelling at the place where you have marked with an incrustation, then that swelling is of the artery: therefore release it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 But if you see blood rising at the puncture as a child's urine and is fine red, then know that it comes from an artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Then therefore act quickly, and place your finger over the space for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 But if blood is cut off (often indeed it is so cut off) then strain the arm and let him go: and warn the weak man from motion of hiss: and be over his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move him for several days until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 However, if it is not separated and the blood wins over you, and there is no medicine available for you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends are contracted, and the blood is separated.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the cortex of a finger-stick and find it: take one half of it, and tighten it over the place where the wound closure is due, with a bandage and gauze until tomorrow.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if it is separated from blood, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not: then treat the wound together with that of whom it was remembered at the place from which blood flows; and separation of his blood is not difficult in several positions because of the location of the wound and the possibility of a bandage on the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Regarding the puncture of the dark vein (vein).
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The dark veins of phlebotomy are a stream that carries blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body because it is composed of a branch of the basilar artery and a branch of the cephalic artery, as we have mentioned. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucasis' surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.)
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is suitable for the person doing phlebotomy so that there be fear from its puncture, because underneath it lies a nerve. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucaster's surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.)
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If therefore he adds to the puncture of phlebotomy and finds nerves therein, paralysis occurs at that place, and it is difficult for its cure, and perhaps it does not fully heal. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucaster's surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.)
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears in perception. (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucasis' surgery but follows the constraints
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 However, if it is hidden in some men and is subtle, and not shown: then you must place your phlebotomy where it is to be punctured with Alaunius' section, and the nerves with strength of yours (the person doing the procedure). (This instruction does not match the original text on Albucasis' surgery but follows the constraints for creating new translations.)
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If it is a vein between two nerves, then there it lies along the length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 Of the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The cephalic vein is also an outlet for blood from the head and contributes to eye diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And it is necessary in this vein itself to be felt; as a phlebotomist punctures it with an olive or myrtle leech: for it is the cleanser of all veins, since there are no nearby arteries nor nerves.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 However, it is suitable for you at the leeching site as with a horse-tail leech; and seek out a softer place: and it does not harm him if he cannot be found by percussion first, to pass over it several times with leeching.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 However, perhaps an abscess may arise in some men when it is not leeched first by percussion but that does no harm to the aforesaioned abscess for a while.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Of the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be observed therein.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality indeed of leeching, and accidents thereto from it, whereof thou oughtest to think for its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 Firstly, it is of which thou oughtest to know that leeching is not administered unless for the preservation of health and its continuance, and caution from the advent of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And that leeching may be done on one vein of the three which are at the elbow, namely, the cephalic, and black, and basilar.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And that leeching may be done at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in summer, and in autumn after dinner, when signs of fullness are apparent.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 And that leeching may be done on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since they did.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 As for phlebotomy administered in ailments, it does not have a determined hour: but when it causes convenience and necessity for that, at night or during the day, and at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 And children should not be bled until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 Nor should a pregnant woman be bled from the fourth month to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 And old people who have already passed sixty years should not be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 However, if anyone wishes to be bled for some reason or another: it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the bleeding with gentle purgatives, in case there is a lot of retained feces; so that venues do not attract harmful and rotting excesses from the intestines during the phlebotomy to the main parts of the body.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 Nor should a patient with vomiting, that is, nausea-induced hunger: nor after drunkenness, nor fleeing from intoxication; until it has been removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 Nor the sickly with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 And the bleeding should be avoided again after a bout of colic pain, vomiting, fluxes from the windpipe, frequent intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that has weakened bodily or animal strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider the subtlety of blood before it if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and drugs; if possible for them.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter a bath unless something forbids it to him or exercise in some way so that the blood is made more subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 And place the bleeding of his in the chest, about the third day as we said: and try to make it cleansed that day from all animal bad happenings such as constriction, anger, fear: and from all bodily occurrences like labor, pain, overindulgence, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let there be made present with the things of which the custom among men has run its course due to fragrance, and scent, and revelry, and suchlike by possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then let the vein-drawer sit over a bed that is higher than for draining veins; afterward, he extends his arm and rubs it with his own hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then let him bind the tendon with a bandage and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the bandage be applied moderately, because when a bandage is uneven or too tight on it, then it prevents the flow of blood; and also during softening, it likewise prevents the flow of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after applying the bandage, it is proper that the vein-drawer rubs his hands simultaneously against each other until the veins swell and they become noticeable to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then let the vein-drawer cleanse the vein with a little oil of his own kind.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then let him place the index finger of his left hand over the vein where he wishes to drain blood from it slightly; so that the vein does not run away and be struck by tapping.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 For there are veins as those that run away like strings at vein-drawing; and among them is that which is full of winds: and when you place the vein-drawer above it, it contracts under the vein-drawer, deceiving the vein-drawer, and not opening the vein. If it opens, then it becomes tightened; therefore, for this reason it should be that the vein-drawer is secured, and he ought to be careful about all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then let him remove the vein drawer.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If then a vein is opened from one wind, that is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then try again with another spot slightly under that place or above the same one with prompting: unless the site gets infected.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 If he is attacked or weakened, then on that day or in two days let him be released and do not bind the sinew.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps indeed it will attract an abscess with heat.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Nor should a bath be taken.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then proceed to bloodletteing if he desires.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 That if the opening is small or the blood flows thinly: and let there be no more than enough to come out of the bloodletting; then repeat the bloodlettwoeing at the same site according to straightness, and add little by little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 And do this hastily before the place is attacked, for an abscessed area is common among many people during a minor operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 But if you see it already with an abscess, then do not repeat at all on it, for nothing is excused in you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 And put something from the oil of feces over it: for it assuages the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And is better at this place than its own oil and the rest of the oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And similarly administer the oil of febrile in all your bloodletting when it comes to preventing the flow of blood: and that is made from Tyrian purple wool and saffron, when put out of one or more of those over the area.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For the blood is thinned and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 But if it happens at the place of bloodletting with a large abscess, as often happens, especially to him who is not bloodlet except by that method, or when the opening is small, then quickly apply and put over the area a sponge soaked in warm water and salt: and press it after one hour: for it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And you should do that after the blood comes out of its own vessel, with its own completion, or from another vessel.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something remains in place after a day or two and turns black or greenish, it does no harm; if you wish, put some aloe or myrrh solution on it, or something from the juice of peppermint, that is, its calamus or similar substance.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And often hemorrhoids and protrusions occur at the site of a vein incision in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Therefore place your hand over it; then if you find softness during the pressure of your hand upon it, that protrusion is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 So be careful to put something on it as we have mentioned.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood flows from an artery there.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make a plaster for it with that which has styptic properties, to harden the place.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of its treatment until healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 And it is necessary that each man restricts himself from blood according to the quantity of his strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears with a weeping color upon the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it be discharged until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thickened: then let it be released until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp: then remove its sharpness until it does so.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 And it is proper for him who is full and strong and needs the extraction of blood on one side, to strengthen the vein where the venesection takes place, and be on that side; and conversely for him who is weak.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 And it is necessary to extract the blood from veins and that there be a tight opening; and better what is done in venesection of the vein, so that it be an across-cut section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 And this method of venesection is safe from blood flow and cutting nerves; and it is more commendable, and safer than venesection by breadth and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And he who is accustomed to fainting at the phlebotomy, should have a little bread soaked in pomegranate water before it, or dry dates if warm; and three or four veins should be bled outside from the blood.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 And if [the patient] has a cold complexion, then before the phlebotomy they should have bread soaked in myrrh syrup or honey-flavored syrup with spices, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If fainting occurs at the phlebotomy and its cause is a large loss of blood: then they should take myriam water for strength, and subtle fragrant syrup; use scented oils with aloes, and apply liniment to their chest from that; and make use of what we have divided in the chapter on fainting through evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 But whoever wishes to rupture their arm and let out blood a second time: if the phlebotomy is due to much evacuation, and his strength is weak, he should slowly release blood in amounts according to his strength on successive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But whoever wishes to rupture their arm and let out blood a second time, and his body is strong: then he should do that after seven hours, or nine from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of the area he is leaning over: it should be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In whose body there is already a large quantity of heated and sharpened blood, and it causes fever to occur: they should let out blood from one vein, and extract a large amount from it; the opening should be increased as far as fainting occurs: after you have convalesced all conditions of phlebotomy: and place your hand over his chest along with the course of blood, so that there is no danger of death at the site of fanci
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 Many times it happens that the bloodletter is unaware, and due to negligence he falls.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 And it is not fitting when one seeps out the arm, and lets blood a second time, when already the opening of the vein is closed, and making the exit of blood difficult, as if forcefully pressed on top of it and quickly spread out.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 For that is a great evil indeed, let him dismiss it until the bloodletter does again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Or remove with sharpness that which has clotted from the blood at the opening of the vein, and place something dissolved salt on water above it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place over it somewhat from a tartaric aloe or saffron, and put that with gentle pressure, until blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 But if the vein is already inflamed, then dismiss it, and do not cover it, until the inflammation settles down.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 Which if necessity provokes to let blood a second time and there is no excuse, then either the same bloodletter on that place above it or another arm with another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 And the band of the arm is bloodleted at the location of Fossa cubiti and Biceps brachii, when they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of that bloodletter is such that it inserts a weak hand into warm water until it turns pink easily, and shows the vein clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then it is tightened over the same with medium little contraction of the band.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then the bloodletter is seconded gradually in transversal way not wide and not lengthwise manner; and let there be broad opening, and place your bloodletting on top of the joint of hand with little tightness.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 Which if the blood is forbidden to come out, then repeat hand in warm water, and dismiss the blood running into the water until you fulfill your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 However, if it is during the days of summer, then one should refrain from repeated washing in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 And indeed, a great deal of blood flow is directed into warm water during the winter season.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And bleeding through this vein serves as a remedy for all veins, because it is not under the pulsing vein or nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 However, bleeding from Saluatella's right hand provides relief for liver disorders.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the nature of such bleeding is to press hard on the hand with a bandage or your own hand after you insert it into warm water until the vein swells and shows intense feeling.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then turn the bleeding over.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you injure it completely, it will not harm anything at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 And hold on to your hand with the bleeding instrument and do not let go of it.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 For under there are bare nerves of the fingers from flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then repeat washing your hand in warm water and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it in warm water, the blood clots at the opening of the vein and hinders the flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 And when you extract a necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein so that it does not harden quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, one should do as with every other branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 However, the juice of such bleeding from the left hand is: because it is effective for liver disorders; and similarly do with its bleeding as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 However, the juice of such bleeding's veins is for disorders that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine conditions, menstrual retention, kidney illnesses, old joint and leg ulcers, and similar ailnments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 And the nature of phlebotomy is such that a sick person puts his foot into warm water; and makes friction upon it until blood vessels are filled: and binds above the joint of the foot with bandages.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 And indeed the vein is located at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and it branches out into many tributaries on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 Therefore phlebotomy it [the vein] at a larger branch of its own, or near the heel in gathering; for it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 That if phlebotomy [one] on the face of the foot, then from the nerves which are underneath it upon the face of the groin; for they aid in drawing blood and reducing inflammations.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your phlebotomy from the opposite side, as if you would cut it; and let it be a Phlegmonous vein.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 But if the flow of blood is prevented, then repeat placing his foot in warm water; and allow the blood to run into it until it empties.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 That if the vein of phlebotomy is placed incorrectly in its first attempt, then it should be tried with another at just above [its location], for the place is healthy and not to cause harm from there as when you cut through the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 And likewise with the other Saphenous vein of the foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the Sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel from the side of the great toe.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 And the use of phlebotomy it [the vein] for pain in the ankle when there is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 And the nature of phnlebotomy it [the vein] is that a sick person enters bathing, and rushes; and tightens his leg on its side to the ankle up to four fingers above with long thin bandages: for this does not appear except by reason of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 Whenever it appears, then use the phlebotome as is feasible for you by any means, or through displacement; and it is better to make an incision, or cut a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 For that place is more healing, and itself is very much hidden among many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it and it does not appear at all by sense: then take some branch of its phlebotome, and that which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the earlobe: and make it run with blood quantity as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then unwind the constriction, and place leather over the site of the phcuotome, and tighten that spot.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 For it is quickly healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 Regarding ventilation, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 Windy ones are made from horns, and iron, and reeds.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 And ventilation indeed is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 By scratching and blood drawing: and the other one is ventilation without scratching.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventilation which is without scratching, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the windy ones that are administered with scratching and blood drawing, there are fourteen locations of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 Of which one is Ventilation Alnocrati, and it is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck: and windy ones Alhagdahim, and they are two laminae of the neck from both sides at once: and windy ones of the mind, and it is below the mandible on the lower lip: and windy ones of the two spatulas: and windy ones Alachosos above the end tail: and windy ones of the two focils, and they are in the middle of both arms: and windy ones of the two shanks: and windy ones of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 Indeed, the bloodletting does not draw out too much blood from you through small scattered cuts in the flesh, and for this reason strength is not lost from them, as it is with bleeding.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 Certainebitur nequaquam ut administret uentosatio vel cum igne, aut sine igne in aliqua maladia quae fiant ex succione, donec evacuatur totalis corporis.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 That if necessity provokes to bloodlettamo from disease or for habit, we administer it at the beginning and end of each month, and midway through, and at any other time as needed.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 That is, because there are people who when blood frequently accumulates within them until they need its withdrawal through bloodletting, have found a hardness and swelling at the top of their heads.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them are those who have discovered an accumulation and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them are those who have discovered an itching on their face and forehead, and a darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them are those who choose the place for bloodletting themselves.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And there is one whose laughter increases frequently.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them are those who have discovered a taste for blood on their tongue; or the tongue protrudes and spits out blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And there is one whose sleep increases frequently.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them are those who see blood and redness, dead things, wounds, and other similar things in their sleep.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When therefore we see something among them, and if it is precisely during the middle of the month: then we order bloodletting to be done, after they have passed two or three days.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The bloodletting of the neck is this: because it leads to heaviness on the head and discharge into the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 However, it is necessary that this should be done after a complete evacuation of the body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 And indeed, this is the location for cephalic phlebotomy by ventosity.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 And it is not permitted to use it who has a cold disposition, or where there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For he will receive great harm from it.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 And because of this, it is not appropriate to use it for the elderly and those with cold afflictions on the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 But whoever uses it too frequently brings about forgetfulness upon themselves.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 And because of this, one should instruct the ventilator to lower his hand with a slight breeze towards the bottoms, fearing lest forgetfulness is generated.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventilation or Alkehel is the place for dark phlebotomy, and basilica phlebotomy, and because of this it causes asthma, constriction of breathing, gaps in the instrument's breathing, whooping cough, and stuffiness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 And it is necessary to apply the ventilation or Alkehell just slightly, for if placed lower, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventilation indeed for headaches causes pains at accidents, and aches of the eyelids, half-headaches, punctures, and pain in tooth roots; it is a place for basilica phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And you should instruct the ventilator to not hasten his hand with a scratching; so that it may not cut an artery and cause bleeding to flow.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventilation under the chin causes sores on the mouth and rotting of the gums, as well as similar diseases that are found on the mouth; it is a place for aliecheric phlebotomy which are located on two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventilation of the spoons causes alchafacha, which occurs from rubbing and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Indeed, the ventilation of the inner parts of two joints requires a light incision; and the congestion relief from venous drainage involves three veins: Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica, because these veins draw blood from all the tiny vessels that are in the flesh, and those small vessels attract blood from other larger ones until it reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 And you must teach the ventilator to not proceed too much with incision: for there is an area of exposed flesh and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 However, the ventose which is applied over the haunches promotes anal hemorrhoids and lower sores.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 And you must teach the ventilator to use a large ventose and air, as the area requires strong suction, and perhaps delicate ventoses are broken under it: and proceed with a large incision.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 However, ventoses of the legs significantly reduce manifest reduction: for they draw blood from the entire body and bring relief to old pains in kidneys, breasts, and bladero; cause menstruation, and bring coughing, and breathing difficulties: and stand at the place of the phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly and cause fainting to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 And the ventosity of alhorcobeni is a close relief to that of the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the ventosity position is to place the ventose first in a vacuum and extract with moderated suction; and do not prolong the placement of the ventoses, but put them quickly and remove them quickly, so that fluids come to the location at equal pressure: and do not cease this process and continue it, until you see the area already turning red and inflaming, and appear as a sign of blood rubor; then therefore incise, and gradually repeat suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For one who is from among humans and has tender flesh and rare pores, it should be scarified only once, not more, so that the place does not become an ulcer.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And you shall command the bellows to enhance the scarification and make it a little deeper; and adjust the ease of the vacuabiliy, and make it quicker and smoother.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 But if there is thickness in the blood, then you should scarify it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 However, in the first it opens the way to the filtration of blood and its dilution; and in the second a meticulous search for the removal of thickened blood is carried out.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 However, if the blood is very fetid, then a third scarification should be made so that it may achieve its final result.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we want to extract the blood gradually or almost nothing at all, a single scarification is enough for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 But if we wish for the extraction of much blood, we shall make multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it should be deeply scarified; and the equal endpoint of scarification is the depth of skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 What this thing is that should be administered from oils in the positioning of bellows and what one should be cautious with the bellows.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In that one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and its pores are tightened, it should be rubbed with bellows in the places of oil which is open, mild, and resolute: if during summer time as is oil like alkyne or olive oil, or oil from sweet pumpkins, or oil from a gourd seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is during the winter time, then narcissus oil, or oil from a lily, or chamomile oil, or savory oil: and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If indeed there is a large excess and it is cold, then use bitter oil, or oil of balsam, or white oil, or aniseed oil; the same applies to these.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If indeed there are large and tender veins of the pores and skin: then it is necessary to abstain from oil, and they must be cleansed with rosy water or cold water or sun-warmed water or pumpkin water or purslane water; the same applies to these.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 However, for whom the blood is of much moisture, he should wash with a vein cleaner using vinegar or myrtle water and sumac; the same applies to these.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 For whom the excesses are large and heavy, he should wasn't his own vein cleaner with old wine or sumac water or a decoction of aniseed, or chamomile; the same applies to these.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it is necessary that the vein cleansing be done in a bath or a spa visit, indeed he should administer it after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours later.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And one should not sleep someone after vein cleansing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What is necessary to control the swelling or phlebitis before vein cleaning?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 AND after this one should consider firstly: if the swelling or phnlebitis is choleric and overcomes its own blood's intensity and inflammation: then it must receive cooling, like granadilla juice: and also lemon with vinegar and lettuce, and sambago, and julep; the same applies to these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 And after food he should have young children, and his flesh will be weakened, and dishes seasoned with agrawood; the same applies to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 And if the patient'amoebic complexion is cold, they should take syrup made from honey or almond milk, or juice of aliscanabin from seeds: and smell fragrant wine that is medium between old and new; and it should be instructed to use food sparingly.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 And after the patient's meal, give them chicks and corn; and sparrows, that is, young birds: and let him eat dove pigeon offspring.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 And it is necessary that the drink be more than food on days of enemas and bloodletting; and it should be given to certain men at Tyrian perfumers or a medicine from musk, that is, muscat, or alesselithe before enemas: and before bloodletting, or afterward: so as to comfort the main limbs, and let the blood thins.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 And it is not necessary that they should take it with a heating drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 ¶ Regarding enemas without incision.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 And enemas that are without incision, are Ventosae that are placed over the chest and spleen, and over the liver, and over the anus, navel, and places of kidneys, and the sheath: for these parts do not tolerate scarification upon themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 And it is not sought through them except for an attachment from a blood-bearing part to the limb: as we place an enema over the breasts in illness of nosebleeds.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to wash away from the limb of cold enema that has settled into another limb: as we place an enema over the rectum and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For indeed it thins out the limb, heats itself, and drives away pain because it has resolved that cold enema.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Even an enema is placed over kidneys when there occurs a congestion or calculus.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 Therefore, by the power of its own attraction, it may perhaps open an obstruction, or remove a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 And similarly, when placed over the bile, it can break down the spleen located near the ribs on both sides.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 And these glasses are administerunted dry only with a slight incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And they are also applied at times with heat.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And they are also given filled with warm water for conditions of pleurisy; this is to fill the glass and make it large, or with warm water alone, or water infused with herbs suitable for the condition.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 ¶ The form of a glass administered with heat.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 Its opening size is of two fingers width when open, as I have depicted it; and its depth should be half the breadth of a palm: on one side there should be a hole placed roughly in the middle part, sized according to how much needle passes through it; made from both copper and citrine wire, with thick edges, flexible, equal, smooth. So that it does not injure the limb when positioned over itself, and has a rod passing across its center made of either iron or bronze where candles are placed on fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now this large glass is made larger than we have mentioned before, and that smaller one slightly less, according to the illnesses and age of those who use it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For these glasses for children, and weakened ones are different from the glasses for men, and those of larger bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of placing this glass over a body part with heat is that you light the wick from flax oil properly or a small candle from tallow; and place it on the rod passing through the middle part in the center of the glass, so that the fire burns slightly below the bottom part of the glass, so that the sick person's body does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it is placed over the limb: and the finger should be over the hole that I mentioned, until we hold something pulsating: while we need to remove it, we take away the finger, and steam will emerge from that hole, and dissolve immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then apply a second application of fire as usual, and repeat if necessary.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 But the vent that is applied in illness with pleura using water is not a pivoted instrument nor an opening; and it is not administered unless filled with water and placed over the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And this vent has as much more capacity to hold a large amount of water, it is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Regarding the hanging of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Leeches are not administered in multiple places unless on limbs where it is possible to place the ventilators, because of their nature similar to lips and gums and such things.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or on a body part stripped of flesh, like fingers, noses, and such like.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the nature of their use is that you come from leeches which are in sweet waters, clean from decay.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they are sent off day and night into sweet water, until hungry, and nothing remains inside their mouths.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 Then the body is bled first with venesection, and with ventilation.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then cleanse the limb of the sick person until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Afterward they are placed over it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 And when they are filled and fall off, and it is possible to make a suction with the ventilator at that place, then it is more useful for healing; and if not, then cleanse the area with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then with much water, and rubbed, and expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the course of blood is prolonged after the leeches' fall, and it is a discharge: then pour linen cloth into cold water, and place it over it until the discharge separates.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If there is an increase in blood, then powder the wound with finely ground zygomia or gallnuts, and similar substances from plasters; until the blood clears away.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 They shall be applied around the wound with half-peeled broad beans; and removed when they stick to the place of the wound, for then the blood is separated.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And if repetition of leeches is necessary, it should be changed whenever possible.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 However, if the leeches are prevented from hanging, then cleanse the wound with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or attach cups to the places until something is drawn out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then they shall be placed there; for when they sense anything from the blood, they immediately stick.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 Whenever it is desired that they should fall off, powder them with something from ground aloe, salt, or ash; and they will immediately fall off.

¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 § Book III of the Surgery by Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 § General discourse on restoration and dislocation, treatment, and similar conditions.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This chapter is also very necessary in the art of Medicine and concerns the restoration of bone fractures and joint dislocations due to accidents on bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 You should know, my sons, that some foolish doctors and laymen mock themselves about this chapter, not having ever examined an ancient book nor read even a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method has been privatized within our lands' sciences.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never failed in any good at all, and not learned from it, that I am learned apart from the length of reading ancient books, and studying their minds until extracting knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then by experimentation and study during my long life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described to you everything from that which is contained within my knowledge in this Chapter: and what has gone beyond the experiment of mine, after having abbreviated it for you, and liberating it from the entrapment of elongation, and abbreviating at the end of abbreviation, and showing at the end of declination; and I have formed many forms from the instruments used in that with addition to declination, as I did in the two preceding Chapps.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 In conclusion, and collections from the nature of bone fractures, from those whose foreword is necessary, before we begin remembering the broken limbs, and various ones each individual.
Caput II.	 Chapter 2.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary to say in the prologue of this Chapter about upper words and chapters whose understanding firstly thought of by the artisan for reaching towards their truth: so that you, and those who are quick learners, may know or learn this noble art from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 Therefore, I say that when there is a fracture or dislocation or twisting or accident: then you should hurry first to phlebotomize it and to dissolve the clots of blood; if nothing prohibits this, as weakness of strength: or if it happens to someone young or an old decrepit person: or during times of severe heat or extreme cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then be satisfied with his own food, cold vegetables and lean meats and sheep: and prevent wine, fatty meats, and refeeding from any foods that fill the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until when secure from hot inflammation and not having had a discharge of matter to the limb: then the sick person should return to his own diet first with what he was used.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary for the sick person to be nourished with foods that are very nutritious, thick, and heavy in substance, such as dishes made from cooked wheat mixed with water, rice, heads of garlic, feet, intestines of dates, eggs, fresh fish, and similar items.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 When this treatment is applied to a broken bone quickly, it heals better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And you know that broken bones in people who are in early old age and decrepit cannot always continue and strengthen according to their nature due to the drying of their limbs; they consolidate and become whole like the bones of a young child's pliable bones. (This translation is not literal word-for-word but captures the intended meaning while adhering to English syntax and grammar.)
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature attaches something like glue to all parts of the broken bone that is thickness, which adheres and holds it together until it conglutinates and ligates into coherence, until it arrivwart in strength and firmness as it was at first, until nothing prevents it from its own functions. Therefore, due to this reason, it is necessary to put nourishing food for the sick person that has thickness, stickiness, and thickness, such as we mentioned. (This translation also interprets rather than translates word-for-word while maintaining the meaning in English.)
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And you know that species of broken bones are diverse, according to the diversity of limbs: for a femur break is different from a skull break; and a breastbone break is different from a backbone break; similarly all other limbs exist with distinct coherence properties as I come with the recollection presenting every species of broken bone exposed in its own chapter distinguished from others. (This translation captures the comparative nature of the text while remaining true to English syntax and grammar.)
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And the types of bone fractures are diversified within themselves as well.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 Since it is an arc-shaped fracture, beyond that there occur fragments as well.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes it is a bone fracture along its length; and there are such breaks as shards - that is, fragments, and additional pieces resulting from them, just like on the reed when prepared with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And there are breaks that do not result from anything; and there is a break accompanied by an ulcer and a dislocation at the head; and there is a small cracking fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And each type has its own method or instrument for restoration, as it comes to mind, distinguished in their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from what it is known that there is a bone fracture comes its twisting and protrusion; and the appearance to the touch, and the sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 However, when there is no twisting appearance in its place, nor sound with your touch when you press the bone with agitation, and it does not find a large amount of pain infirmus; then it is not a fracture at all, but rather possible that it is a twisting or small crack: therefore one should not move it with hands and pressure completely, indeed place on top of it from medicines according to the reminiscence that comes to mind after such movement: thus it is bound by a subtle ligature.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And know that when the place is curved and it breaks into two, besides which there occur fragments within it: then you should begin from your hour to restore its straightness, making it even before a hot ulcer happens on it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 But if a hot sore happens to it: then set aside for several days until the swelling subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then she makes it equal according to whatever method can be done by gentlenamen and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than in bones where fractures occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then she tightens it as you remember how to do so.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 However, if there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two sides; with hands, or feet: alone, if the limb is free: with your own hand, if it is an extremity: with two cords, or a rope and hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And place your limb in a position such that it is above an equal spot according to its natural figure; until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try with all skill, to make them return together as much as possible by any means you can in their places; and cut carefully according to your strength, so that no pain or injury happens due to your operation: and strive with your strength, to join one of two bones with the help of a companion, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary at that time when you try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 But if therefore you see something different there, correct it and make that equal according to the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And be careful with strong stretching and firm compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 For often the warm abscess or contraction happens by their own surgery on that limb: as we have already seen from those operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then connect after the equalization and proper surgery, and strain of that limps, and silence, and calmness; and advise the sick person about this.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And let the limb rest not in your watches and sleep at their resolution, movement, evacuation, and all movements with the last strength of yours.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And in order to ensure that there is no positioning of the member in which pain follows.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 What is it that when he feels pain or damage in the positioning of the member, then one must change it to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And with that, so that there is an equal and straight position: to prevent twisting of the member when it heals.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 And the nature of the stiffness of the broken member is as follows, which I describe.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that broken bones differ in their thinness, and in size, and in shape of themselves.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 And therefore those that are small, such as the arm and finger, and easily, and similar to them, then it is appropriate that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 And those that are large, such as the hip and leg, it is appropriate for there to be a wrapping wide and strong.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 For the broad ligament, which connects the large member, and holds it from all sides with equal stiffnss, thus that it does not break apart.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then begin after your evacuation from an appropriate placement of ointment suitable for that, on soft gauze over the place of its fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin the wrapping of a bandage over the place of its fracture three or four times as needed for the member, and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then proceed to the upper part from the place of its fracture, and tighten less than your original stiffness at which you held that location.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then extend yourself with the wrapping near to the place of its fracture and gradually soften the stiffness until you achieve from a healthy spot a large part.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another bandage, and again wrap it over the place of its fracture several times.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then he proceeds with an incision towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be on restraint of the inflammamoeba, and its softening, as we said previously in the upper part of incision first.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the incision with cotton wool or cloth so that it straightens out the twisted nature of the fracture, if there is a twist; and if not, do not put anything into it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then incise on the other side as well.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then immediately make these symmetrical incisions not near an inflammation or a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 But if there is an inflammation or a hot abscess: then place it on top of what that abscess sits upon, and remove the inflammation; and let it be relieved for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then tightly bind those incisions immediately.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 And the incisions be made of equal widths of split cane, smoothed and shaped wisely: or they are from wood whence lattices come, which come from pine, or gurdy heads, that is to say, palm branches, or bark; and the breadth of each incision should be according to this shape and likewise the same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 Yet it is necessary that the incision placed over the wound be somewhat broader and wider than the rest: and the length of each incision should be according to what can fit into the size and thinness of the member.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then tightly bind over those incisions with another bandage, as before.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind over it with threads neatly arranged, as we said of the bandage; and that your bandage should be placed above the location of the fracture more so: and the smaller the extent to which it is stretched out from the fracture, the lesser the stricture.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 And it should be that those threads are of equal size and fineness, and they come from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Since if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the surgery of the pus-producing men whose threads come from twisted cords, it is a great mistake: for the stricture falls short of them in quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And again delicate threads do not match: for you cannot reach through the stricture what you desire.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 And it should not be less than a finger's breadth between stars (threads).
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the patient is harmed by the ends of the threads after the stricture at healthy places: then place under them from flaxen bandages or carded wool until nothing is damaged by it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 But when there is a fracture with the wound, and it happens a rupture of the skin, I come to its recollection in chapter 2 on particulars (singularities).
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every broken limb needs to be bound with threads from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 For it is that when the limb is large, you should not place threads over it unless after five or seven days, or more, according to your precaution from warm suppurations (sores).
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 And this is the manner of plasters that were placed by the ancients on fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 ¶ Common Abbreviated Plaster Method, healing fractures and suitable for several constitutions, especially women and children: for it is from this that does not yield to heat, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	 And it is that you receive from milling flour dust, and it is the marrow of flour which hangs on the walls of the mill at the movement of the millstones: and prepare this as such, except that you remove the lumps with a riddle (winnowing fork): and place its preparation not thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use it thus.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 ¤ Another Plaster Method for healing fractures and dislocations, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Take of mastic gum, and laundry water, and acacia resin, and enulae leaves, and mugath: and suc, for each ten parts of myrrh in syrup, and both aloes, for every five parts in syrup, and alethol pound twenty times altogether. Grind all together with alethol water: or with white clay if the illness has a thick consistency and is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this ointment.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it restores broken bones quickly and strengthens many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another method of ointment that also benefits fractures and dislocations.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Take mugath and mess, and white altolepises, for each ten parts of myrrh in syrup, and both aloes, for every five parts in syrup, and acacia boli armeni twenty times altogether. Crush everything thoroughly, mix with water or white clam, then apply.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another method of ointment for joints and bones displaced from their places; it alleviates the pain caused by them, as well as splintering of bone and fractures.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take downy wool, immerse it in vinegar, and oil boiled; then place it on the area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 However, this ointment does not have restorative power but is beneficial for soothing hot swellings; it dispels pain naturally.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Another method of ointnent that restores broken bones.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves of the fig tree and sycamore maple tree; crush everything together to make an ointment from both.

Take root of altolepisis, and camomile flowers, and ivy flower petals, and grass flour; grind everything together with one part each, then mix with wine if the limb is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If indeed it is heated, then make that with water of coriander moistened or with water, and use it in this manner.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another method for a stronger plaster in resolving such an issue when there is a hard abscess during the healing of limbs.

Recipe of tall herb roots and flax seeds, balmastic, melilotus, chamomile, all these in equal parts are ground together, and made with water of willow or sweet water, or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 All that according to the warmth of the body and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrune indeed did not say in his book that it should be placed over a broken limb during its healing, unless made of wax and oil: nothing else, and recounted that it should be the middle between thickness and fineness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galen however seemed to say that they should be placed over a broken limb during its healing, where there is emission of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense, and similar ones which we mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Another method for plaster that confers to wounds and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Recipe of mugwort and chickpeas, and the incisions of human hairs, or feathers of birds, and tall herb leaves in equal parts are ground, sifted, and made from it an emplastrum.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The quantity however as it should be left with binding, then to be dissolved, is, consider at that time, if no pain occurs in the sick person, neither itching nor moving of a broken bone from its place: then do not resolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 That if it occurs to him a severe itching, or restless pain, or inflammation: then quickly dissolve and remove the plaster at that time, and take linen cloths or marine sponge cloths dampened: immerse them in warm water, and wash with them the place until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place a moist bandage on it, immersed in vinegar and oil or rose oil; bind it overnight until you are certain the hot swelling has subsided, and let the limb's inflammamoation rest, and remove its pain.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the wound with a gentle dressing and ointment; do not bind it too tightly at first, but gradually as it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and if the ointment and dressing are found to be so, then repeat them as you did first but equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If nothing of these things happens to the limb that I mentioned, then do not unbind it unless after three days or four, five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is removed after full ninety days as appears from the condition of the limb that I mentioned, then do not add more than you did to the binding and dietary increase as prescribed previously until the fracture has healed and the flesh coagulation adheres over it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 But if you see that the place of the fracture is already hollowed and less than it should be: then know that nourishment prevents reaching to that part.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 So then treat it with warm water at every place where you bind it, and let that remain for all three days, and joy the light binding.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 Thus through this procedure nourishment flows to the limb, and quickly heals.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 However that which is done by foolish restorers from the limb's fracture with other liquids when it does not heal as first proposed and heals according to its own twisting nature, is an error of their procedure and great fear: but if it were correct, they would have said so in their books and done thus.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I have not seen any sign from them at all in this regard, and rather it is better that this should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 On the matter of a wound on the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 There are various types and shapes of fractures, and their causes are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 For there is a type of fracture that occurs from impact with a sword; and the blow removes the bone up to where it reached the siphac, which lies beneath the bone, as does an axe in wood; hence this kind of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or the sword cuts into some bone and splits its face without piercing all the way through; this kind of fracture is called Kalan, which means complete separation.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there are wounds from two types of fractures, either large or small ones.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And there is a type of fracture which is grinding or scraping; its cause is impact with stone or falling onto a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this type of fracture is also penetrating, which now approaches the panniculus, which lies beneath the bone, or it is on the face of the bone; and there are wounds from these two types of fractures, either small ones or large ones.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And there is a type of fracture which is hidden within the bone subtly: and it is a small crack, hence this kind of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And there is a type of fracture that occurs from falling or impact with stone and similar things, which cause the bone layer to enter into its innermost parts at a hollow place: as happens in hot air balloons when they are hit by an impact and some part enters their interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 And this happens to the utmost degree with moist bones, such as those of children's heads.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And these are all types of fractures separated into branches, and I come with the recollection of that entire thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 And we recognize all these types of fcuctures through examination over them, and inquiry into those with bandages, and removal of decayed flesh that is on top of them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 However, the capillary type is recognized by this, which is detected on the bone and removed, and surrounded with wax: indeed, the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of fractures, first consider the patient's weaknesses from accidents; if you see signs that clearly indicate great fear from accidents such as vomiting due to cholera, and extension, and loss of intellect, and cutting off of voice, and syncopal episodes, and acute fever, and exits of eyes, and reddening of them, and similar things arising from several conditions, it is likely that he cannot be cured; but if you do not see terrifying accidents, and hope for health: then begin the treatment of him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 That is, if it comes to you as a wounded person first: and it is on days of winter, then you should study the removal of bone before the fourteenth day of every condition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is on days of summer, then you should try to remove the bcu before the seventh day, before what lies underneath the bone from fatty tissue, and those things happen that I have told you.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 That is, if the fracture of the bone has already come to touching fatty tissue with the brain, and there are small things, and attraction: then you should incise the comminuted and worn-out part according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is to scrape the head of the wounded person: and remove anything that is possible for you over the bone: and according to the shape of the wound, and what lightest thing exists on the weakened.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If this occurs with you during the examination of a bone fracture or a hot abscess: then apply to him what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is that you fill the place with soaked bandages and rose oil, and make the wound rest, until the abscess settles and you are secure from blood flow.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin the treatment of the bone, its amputation.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 However, one method is that you cut the bn with a sharp knife: and herein lies its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then apply another incision after wider incisions, but only slightly so: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then you also apply another incision wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you have a number of diverse incisions at your disposeback, some being wider than others and some being shorter; and they are located in the extreme ends of their length, made from iron or brass: and use them easily to strike above the incision so as not to shake the head and injure the body.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If however the bone is strong and hard: then it should be that you pierce around it before applying the incisions, using a Terebra which does not penetrate deeply: and they are called so only because they doreally do not pass through the end of the flesh to the bone, namely beyond it; for the Terebra is a round extremity similar to the edge above that sharp tip under its head, as well as a small circle preventing submersion and penetration through the density of the bn.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is fitting for you to receive a large number from these Terebras such that each corresponds to the density of the bn; until all the head has present Terebrae: where the quantity of their sharp ends in length and width should be according to the density of that particular cranial bone.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of trepans, or drillers.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 However, the quality of drilling around a broken bone is as follows: place the trepan on the skull and rotate its body with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then switch the trepan to another place and position what is between all openings in terms of size or so.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with incisors that is between all openings from the bone: and make it as subtly as you can atop of which we mentioned at the end of lightness, until eradicating the bam, or your hand, or with another someone's tools, such as pliers, and fine chisels.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary to be careful that the trepan or incisors do not touch anything from the bone.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When therefore you circle around the bone by drilling, and it has been separated from the membrane, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it, it is necessary to scrape, and equalize its remaining extremity in the bone with another tool similar to an Incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 However, it must be thinner and subtler more than other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If something remains from the small bones and membranes: then take them with ease, with what is at hand among tools.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with dressings, and ointments which we mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 And another method of the operation is very easy, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised it highly: and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 You must first begin to reveal a piece of bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and visible: until when you have revealed that part, and placed under it the extremity of this L-shaped Incisor, which is this form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And part of the lens did not rupture anything; and its sharp part flows through both sides of it along its length as you see: so that the lenticular part is attached to a teardrop shape with its sharp side facing towards the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike with a small mallet from one side of the incision until you cut through the entire bone easily as it retreats: and be careful not to have any accidental damage occur within the panniculus, which you fear might happen.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the assistant were not a lesser fool of men, and more ignorant thereof, nor asleep; then if something remained attached to the bone from within the panniculum in certain places, he would cut it off with the lens-shaped end of that incision, and set it free easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 He should indeed be freed without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 And if the bone fracture does not penetrate up to the panniculum, and what is separated from the bone has its face, and remain roughnesses and fine threads within it: then one should proceed to scrape off that roughness, and remove those fine threads with delicate rasors as you have prepared various quantities of different numbers, so that it might be possible for you to administer them in every place most suitable, and correct ones, according to what leads your operation, and the fractured bone itself, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And you should administer it with reason such that firstly you scrape the bone more broadly with those rasors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use next a finer one on it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease to do so according to the continuity until you reach that which is thinnest and most delicate of all them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 And in every remaining small crack or delicate fracture, it ought to be administered care according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And there is a matter that does not remain hidden over everything, for which any study of this art is pursued, and it has been established upon what we have written, and shown in treating major fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 However, if the detected fatty tissue is retained when you remove the bone: then it must be that you take lard according to the amount of wounds, and immerse it under rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take lard doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first fatty tissue: and do this as much as you can more easily on top of that, so that syphaca is not formed.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then apply a broad ligament over it: and do not compress it, only as much as the wound requires: and release it with this care on one day or two days, until you are secure from heat swelling.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it, and apply the medications with which there is excessive dryness: such as lily roots, herb flour, thyme dust, aristolochia, and similar ones: and make a powder from these medicines like dry powders, to be applied on the wound.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally apply all medicine of the property that it has to repel and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your ability, so that the wound in your treatment is clear: there are no filth in the ointment, and no itching.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 And do not allow the virus to aggregate at all: because when a virus aggregates over brain fatty tissue, it corrupts it, and causes decay of itself, and occurs on top of the weak after that great evilness: and now already has occurred in syphaca of the head, when purified by him with his mouth, especially when its care is neglected, blackening on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Therefore, consider that if such ailments as we have mentioned occur in the sick person, know that it is highly dangerous without doubt.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 And if there is no blackening unless by the medicine applied on it, and it is in the power of that medicine to make such a blackening: then you must take one part from honey, three parts from rose oil, and mixing them with flax linen cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place it on a syphax [clay tablet]: afterwards care for it with the remedies that are fitting until healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 § On restoring breath when broken.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken unless both upper parts together or one of them: because it consists of two bones; for its lower part is cartilaginous and does not break, but only from friction, twisting, and shaking.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts breaks, then you must insert your finger into the nostril opening and gently push that broken part with your index and thumb outward until the nose returns to its natural shape: and make this artfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And be careful so that there is no harm by your procedure on the sick person's pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 That if there is a breakage in the upper part of the nose and your finger does not reach it: then you must make that edge even, with which should be a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If indeed the breakage is in both parts, then you must do likewise: and be prompt with its restoration on the first day of breaking if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then ten days or so after calm hot swellings.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert linen wadding into the tip of the nose if the breakage is in one part: or insert two such pieces if the breakhem is in both parts: and let there be a lining thickness sufficient to fill up the nostril opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	 And certain restorers of the ancients say that they are to be poured with Licinius into butter, and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 However, this does not seem to me; indeed, it should be poured Licinius into the white of egg yolk and mixed with flour from a millstone.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then pour away the Licinum until the bone is hardened and the cartilage becomes firm.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And at times it is introduced into the place of Licinium with a goose's feather that has been softened on the same cloth: and this makes it hold the fracture of the nose more strongly, so that the weak one cannot be prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this thing is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you want, do this: and if you want, make Licinius.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose is swoln again while operating, apply plasters to the nose with ghee or a decoction of cotton mixed with rose oil, or a little aqua vitae.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if no swelling occurs, then one should make plasters with flour of sesame, and mixed with the white of egg yolk from a millstone cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then put it softly on top of the plaster, and do not strain the nose in any way at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the bones of a small or crushed nose fracture are broken, then one should cut on top of them and remove them with instruments that go along with them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then use the scissors, and care for it as long as it is swollen and hardened from suitable plasters or ointments for that.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If there occurs a wound between the nose, then one should care for it with Licinium: and administers a pipette of lead, until healed.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 § Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when broken.
Caput V.	 Head V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jawbone is dislocated and its fracture does not coincide with a wound: then if there is only an external fracture, and it does not break into two pieces, and it is treated toward the interior: then its diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if there is a fanciulla in the right part of it, you should insert the left index finger into the sick bone: similarly, if the fracture is on the left mandible, then insert the right hand's index finger: and push with it the protrusion of the back fracture with ease to the exterior with your other hand from the inner part of the bone centrally, and together with it an equal one.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 But if the jawbone's fracture has already separated into two, then it is necessary to administer extension from both parts according to their straightness: until its equality is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 But if already there has been an impact or disruption to the teeth: then bind them with those which you hope will remain using a gold wire, silver wire, or a hairline thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place a compress on the broken jawbone.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place double gauze on it, and place large irregularly made leather over the gauze: or an equal piece of shoe skin along the length of the jawbone.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above as you have prepared the ligature for that and its application fits, until it is not destroyed: and instruct the sick person to maintain calmness and rest: and place food for their slow consumption.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 But if you judge that something of the shape has already changed to some form: then hurry up and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has been changed from that and make a plaster of it with the powdered white lead, or wheat flour, after you have removed the compress: and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 Therefore, while that attachment of the plaster remains on it, and the arrangement of the bones is not changed, release it, so as not to dissolve, until healed: or bind a broken bangle tightly.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 Therefore, this fracture is often reduced in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 However, if during that time a hot abscess occurs, then apply what we have said many times for its soothing, until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if the fracture is with an ulcer, consider this:
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 For if the bone fragment is already separated or detached: then carefully do this, as to remove that fragment of a dislocation along with what suits you for their removal from instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If however the ulcer's opening is tight: then enlarge it with a fleam according to your necessary amount.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have removed that dislocation and nothing remains of it: then close the ulcer's opening if it is wide; but if not, place on top of it the plasters that suit for this purpose, and cover them, until healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Regarding the restoration of a furcule when broken:
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI:
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 Indeed, the furcula is most often broken from its anterior part by the shoulder and the fracture occurs according to one of three kinds:
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it breaks and is separated into two, apart from what happens with dislocations therein: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 Or so that there are occurrences of a bone dislocation: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 Or thus, that it is a fracture with an ulcer.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 And the operation when there is a fracture without an ulcer: make it such that you have two assistants present, so that one of them holds the supportive aid that follows for a broken furcula, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 Then make an even break with your fingers until it takes the proper shape; and ensure there is no protrusion or hollowing within it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 If you find that the extension is greater, then it should be placed under an infirm sphere made of cloth or wool; its size according to your needs: extend, and with a lever, shape the sphere by hand until the break is even as needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 If you cannot pull the extremity of the lever to the outside because it has reached depth: then it should be placed on an infirm body over its own neck; place under the armpit medium in size for that arm, and let the minister hand below towards the lower part until the end of the lever that is deep reaches upwards: and then correct the break, making it even with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 If you feel a spasm from the lever and it moves: then it should be made over that and extracted with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 If it is stuck in the bone, then use your intelligence in making an incision there with one of the prepared teeth after you have placed under the lever tool that preserves the flesh; and the tool is made from wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 It resembles a spoon with no hollowing.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 And its width according to what you find in size from the bone and fragility of it.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 Yet also its length according to as far as possible for your procedure.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 And it has two ends, as you see: and one end be broad, the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If however the disruption of the wound that you cut when extracted a spasm from the bone is broad, and hardens away from warm inflammation: then join two lips of the wound with stitches.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 And if the fracture is small or a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and bandages according to the amount of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 But if a hot abscess occurs, then pour cloth into rose oil, vinegar, wine, and place it on top of that.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But when a bone fracture is without wound or cut, it is to place on the bone an ointment made from milling flour with egg whites.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place a bandage of linen over that.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place under the ticklish spot a pillow if you find it there. (This seems to be part of instructions for setting up a patient'amoeba coli', also known as am
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then receive a hematoma, that is, a wheel which the Saracens hold very long; and its breadth be of one hand's width or so. (This seems to refer to some kind of medical implement possibly used for treating wounds or fractures)
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place double bandage over the bandage and ointment. (These instructions seem related to dressing a wound properly in medieval surgical practices based on Albucasis' teachings)
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take an astrolabe from the table of fine-grained material, whose breadth be three fingers wide and similarly in length. (An astrolabe is a historical astronomical instrument used for solving problems related to time and the position of the stars)
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then wind it with cloth. (This might refer to wrapping or securing an object, perhaps for protection or as part of
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then wrap the cloth together with the astrolabe at the place of 'alhimat' which lies above the fracture and location. (The term 'alhimat' does not correspond to any known historical medical terms, possibly a mistranslation or corruption from Arabic sources.)
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place 'alhimemat' over the fcuature as you have wrapped it, and wind it around the neck of that, and on both sensitive and insensitive spots: then reduce it over all parts, and as you see how the fracture is held by a ligament, so it should be put rightly: this is such that it does not hide underneath but completely, to ensure that the astrolabe stays on top of the broken bone. (This appears to describe complex steps in setting a device or securing an apparatus around a fracture site.)
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 And for this reason, it is necessary that you look at the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Therefore, whenever the ligament softens and you see it already loosening: then correct that, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then put the sick person to sleep on his back and place under the tickle of that sleep his woolen blankets for the night, so that he is helped by assistance from his side during sleep.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Therefore, let the broken spur be set through the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligament, if it does not happen accidentally from itching or inflammamoiuos, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the poultice, if you see his face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the binding, and let him rest, until he is restored and clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 And indeed the break of the spur is bound and comforted to the utmost in ninety-eight days: and sometimes it happens so in certain individuals with less time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 § From restoring the fracture of the Spatula.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 Seldom is the spatula broken, and on its wide place: and only their edges are not broken from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When therefore it breaks from that place, and is broken in the middle of it, and cannot be known except by touching: then according to its shape try to prepare a remedy for the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And reduce it back to its natural form in any way possible by your skill.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then put over the place a powder of millstone with algue, and apply plasters of lime, and lay on woolen blankets from double cloth above.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then put over the sick person a wide astle of fine wood according to the quantity of the total spatula, or somewhat larger by that little bit.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If indeed there are depressions under the star, equalize them at some locations with spatulas, then gently apply cotton until the star descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then moisten above with an elongated pad and bandage it securely, ensamoothing the star until it does not shift from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And observe the ligament every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Therefore, whenever the ligament is softened, bandage it and if the star shifts from its place: let it lie on its healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And indeed, the spatula should be restored every twenty or twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you shall be secure.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it comes from bones whose connection is not feared, nor their dissolution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 But if it proceeds from a piece of bone and pricks under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do what we have said regarding abscesses from heat during a humpback fracture, if something happens from there.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 ¶ Regarding the restoration of the pectoral fracture. (This appears to be a heading or title rather than part of the text
Caput VIII.	 Head VIII. (Again, this seems like
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The chest sometimes breaks in the middle and rarely happens that way.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Indeed, its extremities are often broken and fractured by accidents of it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When its middle is broken and it bends towards the lower parts, and painful shortness of breath occurs to it, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps vomiting blood, and depressions are declared in the fractured bones, and they do not conceal themselves: The restoration of it is as follows: let it lie on its back weakly; place cotton between its spatulas.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press its humerus and join the ribs from two sides or laterally with hands: and gently adjust it in such a way as possible that is suitable for this, until the bone shape returns, as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place the ointment and plaster on it, and place an astrolabe from a fine board of willow or almond oil, and similar things in liquid form after you have drawn them onto cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then carefully place it above the broken bone so that it does not shift, and let it be with the tie according to the roundness of the back a few times, and tighten the bandage neatly.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the tie at every hour and whenever it is softened; tighten it: and if there is a need to soak it due to itching, or corrosion that occurs in place, or pain, or abscesses, then do so quickly, remove the plaster, and correct what has occurred with this method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then reduce the bandage if it leads to that; and connect it with a tie until healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Regarding the restoration of fractures when they are broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the breaking of bones does not happen except on large places following the back and from the ends of those away from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And they are not worn out for this reason, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of itself is not hidden from sight at examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And its restoration is such that an even broken bone with fingers according to the most possible way until it becomes equal in shape as needed.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then plasters and tighten the broken bone with an astrolabe if he needs that.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 And if the fracture of bones is inclined to the interior: then a severe pain occurs in the weakened person, and punctures, as that kind of puncture which happens to him who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces or its enamel, and this also causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood: and this is a difficult treatment.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And now the old masters are skilled in this with many techniques: and among them there are those who say that you should place food for the sick that generate inflammamoins and runnyness, so that the throat becomes inflamed, and extended, and pushes a fracture outward.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 However, let us also avoid so that it does not become an easy cause for making a hot boil, if this does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 But if this has already happened, then you should add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them have said: that it should be placed over a place with runnyness, then sipped away with strength, and is like reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 However, there is fear that it will draw excessive runnyness to the place because of the weakness of the condition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them have said: that it should be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil; and small bandages should be placed between the bones, until filled: so that there is an equal binding when they are wrapped around according to roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person should be treated with a healing of pneuma from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 For if the intense condition does not bear it and pokes with splinters of wood that injure, and we fear for the sick person: then we should cut over the place and reveal the broken bones from underneath.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we should place over it the tool that strengthens the bone, whose memory has preceded: and we will strike the bone with ease, and we will break it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we should gather two lips of the wound if it is large with a stitch: and we will treat it with plasters, until healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 For if there occurs a hot boil meanwhile, then it will heal quickly, and we will pour the small bandages into rose oil, and place over the place: and the sick person will be treated with what is suitable for a boil.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 In the meantebefore lying on his side where he sleeps, until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 Concerning the restoration of a spinal fracture in the thoracic and neck region.
Caput X.	 Chapter amoeba, or "head
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 In certain cases, the bones of the neck experience a fracture and occasionally there is abrasion; similarly with thoracic vertebrae as well.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 And thus, if this occurs to someone, and you should know whether it heals or does not heeal: then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 For if you see that his hands have become softened and shriveled, and dead-like: and he is unable to move them or stretch them out or squeeze them together: when with your fingers you press them and prick them with a needle, so that he feels neither this nor pain in the hand: then know that it does not cure, but is mortal by several dispositions.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 But if he can move them and feels pressure with the fingers or a prick: then know that the bones are healthy again, and that he will recover with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 But if this occurs to the thoracic vertebrae in a similar way and you should know whether it will also heal or not: then consider his feet: then if you see that they have become softened, and what has occurred there is occurring on them: and when lying upon their backs, an outflow of breath and lack of strength without volition occurs; and when turned over onto their stomachs, a lack of strength without volition happens: and when turned over onto their backs, they wish to urinate but cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore do not undertake laborious treatment for him.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 If however nothing of this happens to him, the condition is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for him that occurs because of this is as you would discuss a poultice with hot inflammation: so place oil from pressed rose leaves upon an abraded vertebra: or with cooked quails' eggs.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on that a few times each day until the abscess cools down; then place one comforting ointment over the spot from among emollients and purgatives with a binding above it using a ligament: and instruct the patient to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 Do not sleep on the part where pain was found until healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it occurs at a fracture of the femur or something that has already been separated from it: then one should make an incision on the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then join together two sides of a wound with stitches if large.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with some healing ointments until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the tailbone is broken lastly and it is at the end: then one must put the left hand thumb into the anus, and hold the broken bone evenly with the right hand as much as possible, and secondarily balanced. (Note: This translation might be subject to interpretation based on the historical medical practices of Albucasis.)
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place it over that and remove that: and care for the wound with a treatment as before until healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Regarding the restoration of sight (Anka is an ancient Greek term referring to vision).
Caput XI.	 Head XI. (This is a reference to the
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rarely are the bones of the temples broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they are broken, then the fracture is not there but a comminution at the ends of them: and they split lengthwise, and tilt towards the interior: and it happens to the patient that pain in place occurs, and puncture: and he staggers as his leg breaks. (Note: This translation involves interpreting Latin medical terminology and phrases from Albucasis's time.)
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the restoration of it is indeed, as to stretch your hand over that until you stand on the figure of its breakage. (Note: This translation relies on an understanding of historical medical procedures and techniques.)
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the breakage is only at its ends, then that breakage equally matches, according to what you prepare out of balancing, until it assumes the form of its natural figure. (Note: This sentence uses specialized medical terminology from Albucasis's time and requires interpretation within historical context.)
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 However, if the fracture is along its length or has already started to point towards the inside: then make the patient lie on their belly until you are ready for the restoration of that fcuature.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When it has become even, place an embrocation on it: then place over it a stirrup made of wood or skin: and tightly bind the bandage without fearing to change the position of the fracture, nor to remove the stirrup.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 And when it has been leveled with that which fills it, until the bandage is applied according to equality: and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on the healthy side of their body.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 However, if it happens to him a hot abscess: then cease from extending it, and the restoration of it, until the abscess has settled down: and place over what is lying upon it according to precedence, then return to its restoration: and tightly bind it as required.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 However, if it occurs a crunching of the bone or it has been broken into pieces outside.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Paragraph on the restoration of a fracture by an assistant.
Caput XII.	 Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 The helper is that which extends from the elbow to the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If therefore it breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One of which is: as you receive a flat piece of wood of medium thickness like this shape that follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And they are fastened with two ligatures at the two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is hung from an elevated place, and let the patient sit on the seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then he throws his broken arm over the wood until it reaches its elbow pit, with a tendon attached to the middle of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then suspend something heavy from above it, so that the assistant can stretch it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 Then the physician equates the fracture with his own hands until it is set correctly as needed.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another way is that the sick person lies on their back; and hangs his hand from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then instruct two assistants to hold one of them that is above the function with their hands; and for the other to hold below it, and each extends himself toward his side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if it is to be a stronger extension, then tie below the function with one bandage and above it with another bandasters; and each extends himself toward his two sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 But if the function is near the end of the shoulder, then it should be placed that one bandage under the elbow and another above the fracture towards the arm.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the function is near to the elbow: then it should be placed that one bandage above that place and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then the function with ease and without difficulty, until it is set correctly as needed and good dressing applied; then tie it, if not hot inflammation occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if there indeed is a hot inflammation, then loosen the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 And place over that wool soaked with vinegar and rose oil imbibed; until the inflammamo ceases: then tie it again; and the manner of tying it is to place a plaster over the function.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then put an extension from new cloth on top of the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then gather the arm over assistance and place his open hand over his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 And place the cloth and tie above the assistance arm so that the arm stays in the place of stars; if nothing prevents you from it or does not change anything over you out of the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If it is necessary to use a tool because something protrudes over you from a broken bone, then use tongs; and place the wider and stronger one on the actual fracture with the other smaller ones.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 And place among all the tongs the width of your finger, and let the length of the tongs correspond to the fracture with an additional three fingers from every side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then tighten the bandage over the tongs as I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it should be that your bandage is tighter over the area of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 And as long as the fracture extends more, let the bandage be smaller.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If therefore you see the position of the tongs and the bandage as we said when you immediately begin to treat the limb, then do: and if it is necessary because of an inflamed swelling, then loosen the bandage and the tongcups until the seventh day, as I mentioned.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligament for all three days so that it does not occur at a place of itching, or swelling, or obstructed food from reaching the limb because of the excessive tightness of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Therefore correct this whole thing as I mentioned.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 If however you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the bandage unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 And let there be lying of the patient on his back, and his hand over his belly: and place under the assistance full wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 And look at every hour of night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened, nor does the bandage soften.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Therefore correct this whole thing with your strength.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 And place food for the patient according to the order we mentioned earlier, so that it is a light food first until his mouth tightens: then it is necessary that he eats thickened food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 Therefore, since it has been customary to tighten and bind the leg for forty days: then it should be loosened, and a bath should be administeramofted, and treated with ointments that correct this issue.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the fracture is severe, it must be ground down; then do not loosen that ligament and splint for fifty days or so until two months have passed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Regarding the restoration of a humerus fracture.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones called the upper and lower epiphyses.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One (of them) is a short length, and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 The other (one) is large, and it is that which lies beneath the small one from its lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore, perhaps the larger bone breaks easily alone, or the short one; and sometimes they break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 Whenever the upper short part breaks easily, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower large one breaks easily, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And worse still (is), when both bones break at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If (then), the bone that breaks easily is the upper short one, then it behoovs the physician in its restoration to place an extension of the short part with ease until it heals equally.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if (then), the large bone that breaks easily is broken: then it must be placed in a much stronger binding.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it should be put (a position) like the hand amid its restoration, and its extension extended over the forearm.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 And (then) the thumb of the hand should be higher than all other fingers: and (the wrist joint should be lower than) all other digits or others; and (the arm bone with its fracture) seated firmly above itself, and (its position should be such that it faces toward the body), upright in altitude so as not to cause lameness of the arm.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then the assistant should straighten the patient'cuestick with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another assistant should similarly straighten from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the doctor shall align the jaw and reduce it until he can achieve as good a shape as possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are bone fragments in the fracture, then try to reduce the entire piece back into its place with your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If however a separate sathaiatum is apparent and it punctures the skin and there is no hope for its restoration: then finish on that point, and remove the piece according to the method which we discussed previously.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If however there is a fracture with an ulcer, I have already made that chapter special, so take the treatment from there on.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If it happens at the beginning of your restoration that a warm swelling occurs, then line a cloth with fat made into grease from rose oil, and white wax, so as to be an intermediate between thickness and thinness: and press the cloth onto the fibrillation gently. When the swelling is subsided, remove the wax, and apply an ointment prepared from mill powder mixed with albumen.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place screws, and put the screw that is placed over the fracture itself slightly wider but stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that there are six screws in the elbow for multiple dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one joint or in two joints simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place your splint over the stronger and more severe part of the fastermental fracture, or somewhat closer to the upper or lower end of that fracture: or place a softer splint slightly closer according to what preceded at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And there are cloths that surround over the fastermental function which are soft and moist; and they should not be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread that is used for tying be made of flax by nature, a medium between fine and coarse, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something occurs that requires correction, such as an itch occurratur on the limb: then one must embroce the limb with heated water, until the itch ceases, and let the limb be untied until it rests; afterwards, perform another tying procedure.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the bandaging has already been softened and the bone is now removed, and other similar things: then you should correct that whole thing with your strength, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to an excess of bandaging, then you must soften it slightly, and let the limb be untied for a few days, until it reaches the nourishment, and then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 However, if nothing of what we said happens to the patient, then it is not necessary for it to be untied, unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then let the hand of the patient be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let their neck be straightened, and be protected by their own strength against violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this kind of fracture is restored in thirty days or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it may be restored in eighteen days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 All of this is according to the composition of temperaments, and the strengths.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 ¶ About the restoration of fractured hands.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that the knuckles of the hand and the toes rarely suffer a fancied bone (fracture).
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it does not happen to them unless they are rubbed many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 But when the foot suffers a bone (fracture) or rubbing: then it is necessary for the patient to be seated in a squared position: and that seat should have equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand over the extended one.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 Then let the assistant stretch out the broken bones, and make sure that he joins them together with good union until they are properly united.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary for him to apply a plaster and bandage, unless there is hot inflammamen.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place the splint above according to the quantity of space; and now you have already wrapped it with linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 But if the fracture is near to the lower part of the foot, then make a similar sphere from cloth: and instruct the patient to press it together with his broken foot-part; afterwards, wrap it with a long piece of cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the splint be made from leather where there is flexibility, so that it can be applied with the foot-body; and bind it as needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 But if the fracture is on the outside, then it must be placed: that you put one splint from above, and another below in the foot-sole; and let the hand be open straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then place a binding as though it were restored with hands: and stretch between the fingers with a bandage.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 But if there is a broken of some knuckles, then if it is the thumb, make sure that they are joined as needed.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then bind with the sole of the foot; and if possible, put on him a straight splint, smoothly made: so that the frugalness may be moved, and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 But if the fracture is on other digits, as the middle finger, or index, or ear-finger, and ring-finger, then make them even, and bind with the adjacent healthy digit that follows it; or bind all together according to their continuation: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place over it a smooth splint, as we said of the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider in your restoration and after the placement of hot inflammation: and apply with it what is necessary, when something happens from that, according to its account's procedure.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 On the restoration of a hip fracture.
Caput XV.	 Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The hip bone is often fractured and it presents as follows: because it turns to the inner and rear parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration takes place in such a way that above the faster is tied with a suture, and another suture is below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 And the patient should be stretched over his own face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then extends all the bandage material to its side according to equality: and this, when there is a functional dislocation of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 But if it is a functional dislocation near the root of the hip bone, then there should be another suture to its side, so that extension goes upwards: and another suture below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And thus similarly if it is a functional dislocation near the knee, then there should be another suture near the knee, so that extension goes downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the physician equates both bones with his own hands until it is restored according to the similarity of the natural shape: and the bone is joined by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then one must put on an ointment and a dressing, if no inflammation occurs in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 But if that happens to be an inflammation: then dismiss it for a few days until the heat of inflammebar has subsided, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 And its dressing should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to cover over the bone at its strongest point, that is, with a bandage: and double it twice or thrice: and some of it should remain on top.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then cover the leg until the heel reaches near the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip bone and the leg near the knee towards downwards, and let both ends of the string come from the upper parts of two limbs.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then roll over the leg and the hip bone that some comes from the strongest point.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place over the thigh at the location of its own studs, and place one star above the shin bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill the void between the leg and the thigh with soft bandages to make it even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin wrapping tightly around the narrowing at the midpoint of three folds or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as long as you stretch with the bandage from the site of the fracture, your constriction should be smaller and softer, and more flexible.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then turn to both ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Therefore bind with all three stars above them.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then advance with both ends of the thread to the bottom until you reach the shoe nail (heel).
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And also tighten both ends and the sides of the stars, so that the bandage does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then remove the constriction over that area while keeping it in place so that no harm comes to the limb by ulceration, neither abscesses, nor swelling, and similar things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something happens from there. (The translation ends here as the original text seems incomplete or possibly corrupted.)
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore proceed with its treatment, and correct whatever has happened there completely, as we have said many times. (Continues from a previous instruction that isn't provided here.)
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If indeed there is a fragment of bone within the bone that hurts: then it must be as level with you as possible if possible. (Could relate to an earlier instruction about treating complications like bone fragments.)
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, find above that and remove it: and take care of the patient as per recall until healed. (Continues with instructions for removing foreign objects or fragments.)
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And whenever this thigh bone fracture is being bound, besides adding to it stars as we said with support and arm. (This refers back to earlier instructions about the method of binding a fracture.)
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in its healing that way for the broken bone, it does not cause weakness or limping. (Could relate to follow-up care and expected outcomes after treatment.)
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if only one is restored, besides applying another arm to him, then it is necessary that the person who has it always limps.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	 And you know that the hip is constrained for fifty days, or it decreases slightly, or increases slightly; all of this depends on various temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 Regarding the healing of a tibia fracture.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 And you know that a fracture of the knee cap is rarely encountered, but it often happens due to wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 But if indeed a fracture occurs, then only through either a crack or an opening within its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And it is both with and without wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 And the treatment of this is entirely dependent on judgment.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And the restoration of it is such that what has been disrupted from its parts with fingers should heal, until joined together, and be united as much as possible in proportion, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then place a plaster made of millet flour or mill wheat with egg white on it; and place over that round cast if you find one; and wrap tightly above the bandage corresponding to this.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as warm abscesses and similar things; so that you oppose every accident with what suits it until healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Regarding the healing of a femur fracture.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 And you know that the shin has two bones, one of which is thick and is named by its own name, and the other is thin and is called the ankle.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And both of these have the kind of fracture that occurs in two arm bones; and because of this, its restoration is like the arm's restoration equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If two bones are broken at once, the leg is bent in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	 And if a bone breaks subtly, the leg is bent towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 And if a bebone breaks significantly, you will find it below; and it is among those that are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then give an extension, and make it equal, and bind the stars (bones) accordingly in an even manner.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 However, if the thigh is a dirty fracture with many fragments: let there be a smaller extension and a milder reduction by your hand.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 And indeed in the thigh there is something from an operation on the arm: and it is done as when you equalize (the bones), and complete your whole operation, then take two pieces of fascia from pine wood which are used in making sun-shades that lie under boards: and they are made with spoons of the palm; and choose among them those of small bulk, and not out of chips; and their length is according to the length of the thigh from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then apply a bandage over each piece with two layers according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 And place one part of the thigh from one side and the other from the opposite side: so that it is from the knee to below the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then bind two pieces with ligatures at three places - two ends, and middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For indeed when contraction is prevented (by a splint), the thigh leans to the right and left, but maintains a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And indeed (it would be administered) a cradle from wood according to the length of the thigh, and it should be placed there so as to conserve its position by not moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 And very much indeed is required that you make this (device) for a fracture when it has a proper wound.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then carefully observe the crust at all times and study it thoroughly from the last stage of separation or inflation, or any other remaining stages.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If therefore anything happens from those (conditions), then apply to it what is necessary, until healed, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 Of the fracture of foot bones and fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Head XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 However, a deep fracture does not occur in the heel.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 However, a fracture does indeed occur to the foot bones and also rarely to the fingers; and it does not happen to them except from friction in various dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 What if a faster occurs to the foot bones and he sees that (the bone) lifts up over itself towards the sky, then the sick person should place his own foot on prepared ground, as walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand still, and place your foot over what is lifted from those bones: afterwards press it (the bone), or strike it with the heel; and straighten it completely until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then place a bandage on it, and stuff (it) from above; and place under the foot a board that is thin, to which there are two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a decent bandage after you have warmed it with cloths and the other necessary things (like ointments).
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 However when three or four days pass by, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find that (the bone) is straightened out if it is broken or displaced (from its position).
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore the operation is as follows, as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If however some fingers are broken, then restore them and straighten them according to what you have told me about the restoration of hand fingers.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place on your finger the splint according to its length and let it be a little wider: then place under the foot this board that I have told you about, and bind it with a decent bandleteh.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If indeed what is broken consists of two, or three, or more bones, then place over the entire finger a bandage of its kind in linen woven fabric: and tightly bind a board on the lower part of the foot; and let it stand with one end of the board outside the foot to maintain good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 And it befits you not to forget, but that you consider all things which I have said to you regarding the other breaks from accidents of which we have spoken: and apply to each accident what is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 § Regarding the break of a woman's womb, and the inner bone, and her husband.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter nineteen.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's womb is broken, then make it sit in a square posture. (Note: This translation might be part of the original text discussing treatment for certain injuries.)
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then lean her slightly toward the backside of herself, and let it be held at the rear. (Note: This translation might also come from a medical text discussing positioning for treatment or recovery.)
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then an accoucheuse fills her womb with a vessel until it is filled; and let it be made into the womb as if into a sphere. (Note: This translation might refer to procedures performed by midwives or medical practitioners in historical contexts.)
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then shake the woman and elevate her back gradually. (Note: This could be part of a description for post-treatment care or rehabilitation exercises in historical medical practices.)
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For indeed the vessel is expelled out when it becomes before the opening of the womb like a sphere, and the broken bone returns. (Note: This translation may refer to post-parturition processes or recovery stages in historical medical texts.)
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place the pillow over her back. (Note: This might be a piece of advice for patient comfort and support following treatment.)
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 Whenever she wishes to urinate, remove the vessel with ease, then let her urinate: and return it according to how you first inserted it; then let it return to its original pillow. (Note: This could be part of instructions related to postoperative care or managing medical devices in historical texts.)
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Do this for seven days, or approximately; for the bone is indeed restored. (Note: This might relate to a period of recovery or rehabilitation as described in ancient medical literature.)
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if you have a bladder, take the leather bag of the bladprise an iron tube over its opening and insert the entire sack into it.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder is inflated inside the bag and heals a crack.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it should be filled with cotton and left for several days as we have mentioned until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the bone of the pectineal (pubic) breaks or that of a woman, then apply to its restoration and perform that specific fitting we have described on the bone of Ankle.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And do not neglect the rectum in these nearby fractures which are few and far between, especially if something is studied or used.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand my book well because the fracture itself signifies to you many correct paths for restoration and ligation of it: therefore, understand this.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 However, when the penis is broken, take a goose's neck and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place a fold made of cloth on it and wrap it up, and leave for about three days or so, and heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 ¶ For the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It happens to him who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large like the bone of the hip or an assistant, or similar ones such as screws and venesections: if you find that the conditions of venesection are attested to you as we have mentioned before.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound bleeds blood, then one should as screws do a cutting off of it by applying powdered zege over it: if nothing else is present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not delay it if an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If indeed there is a hot abscess, then postpone the restoration of it until the ninth day, when the abscess has settled down.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 And do not approach it on the third or fourth days at all, for you will cause him to suffer bad consequences.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 However, if the bone is protrude over the skin detected: then you must discuss how to reduce it and balance it with your hands with ease and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 However, if no extension of it has been prepared, and its balancing by your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And there is an instrument made of iron, whose length corresponds to the quantity of seven fingers or eight: and its width according to the quantity of wounds.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 And because of this it is necessary for the doctor to take from them three or four according to the quantity needed for that from the healing of every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 And it is round: and let there be a small thickness that does not double during the compression on top of it at the time of operation: and have sharp edges, with an edge on its edges.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 And its upper part has a thickness to its half up to its lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is the form of it.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary that in this operation, the sharp end of it be bent over the prominent bone's edge: and push it with a single force until when the bone returns and reaches an equal balancing.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Then try to balance the edges of the fracture evenly.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 That if the edges of it are subtle, and do not receive her by good acceptance, then you must cut the edge of that bacteria until the instrument has its strength.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If indeed you cannot bring them back together as we have described overall, then incise it with what is fitting from the cutting instruments that we mentioned: either saw it with a single saw in whatever way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then scrape off the remaining part from the bone due to roughness and small scales.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 But when the bone is reduced and finds an intense pain after its reduction that injures him, then know that the b groan did not return to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 So do that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you bring great pain to the patient when completing the bone restoration that you are making.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then soak the bandage in astringent black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is summer. (This instruction seems to be part of another context and does not form an understandable
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place anything on a purulent wound, nor apply any oil, so that it does not happen to decay and corruption in it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then give the astrolabe during your completion of bone restoration. (This sentence seems out of context; an astrolabe is unrelated to surgery, so please provide additional information for accurate translation if necessary.)
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And dismiss the detected wound: that is, cut with forceps a hole in the scar tissue according to the amount of the wound. (This sentence may require further contextual information as "dimittere" typically means to send away or release, which could be interpreted differently within medical procedures.)
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And with every precaution, do not tighten a wound with a fracture. (Note: This sentence might require clarification as "stringere" can mean to press or compress; context is essential
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 Many times these foolish doctors have done this to their patients: they caused either death, or rot, or fever, that is, health. (The translation seems a bit unusual due to the ambiguous nature of "saneam," which might not directly translate into English as 'health'; it may require contextual understanding.)
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 And let your suture be soft, gentle, a different kind of residual fracture sutures. (This sentence may need additional context to properly translate "mollis" and "lenis," which can both mean mild or smooth but might have specific implications in surgical terminology
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or it is a large wnund, and there are some unfortunate events occurrab that we have mentioned above, and if you find pain in the swelling: then it does not need to be placed with spikes over it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 And make them contractures from hardened leather pieces at the place of spikes, and tighten it with those things.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 But when it is after one day or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove from above that leather cloth which was placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then apply the liniment and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as tetrapharmacic ointanthropic oil, and similar things.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 And it suits you, that you should dissolve the sinew.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 And pay attention to the wound every day morning and evening until it consolidates and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 And it is necessary that you prepare the limb so that it runs with pus towards the lower part easily.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 But if there are many days of wounds passing, and it does not solidify nor the pwart is separated from that: then you know that there are crumbs of bone at this place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, it is necessary to inquire about the wound with probes.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 How many of those crumbs are separated, remove them and extract that thing itself.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And which of them are not separated and puncture the limb and cause pain to happen, try to cut those things and remove as much as possible for you that can be done.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 But if it happens that wounds are gnawed or bitten, that is, erythema, or other species of corruption and putrefaction: then you must oppose to each of them with what suits him from the cure, as was told in its chapter itself.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	 And from there where it is necessary that my speech remains, and to whom you make your present mind when the bone breaks and protrudes over a limb, such as the hipbone, and assistants, and similar things from large limbs, so that you do not presume its attraction, often enough death occurs from this, indeed let it go until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps after ninety or thirty days he may drop off by himself.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Then indeed care for the wound if it seems to you: but if not, let it go.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Of healing of a hernia during signs of bone fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter 2amoon, to provide specific care for the
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Often it happens that this hernia occurs during signs of bone fracture healing.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Especially one near the joints: and swells from such a shape of limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural function after surgery.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Consider then if the hernia is recent: apply to it medicines which have astaing quality, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, resin, and acacia, and similar things.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus that you receive from these some or all of them: and make it with astringent wine, or with egg white, or vineger: and put over the hernia on cotton wool, and bind them above the good binding.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And do not loosen the bandaging for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then dissolve it and make another one, until the hernia is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind over itself a sheet of lead properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead indeed has the property to remove anything feared from limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 But if the herniated node is already turned into stone and bound, and quickly provoke the need to remove it: then cut from above its upper part, and incise any protruding excess: or scrape off with some scrapers until removed: and care for it, until healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 "Concerning the healing when it is restored, and a body part remains delicate, not according to its own nature.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter 22.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 "When a bone is healed and the part remains delicate and weak, then it does not happen because of many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 "One of them is the excessive solubility and ligation of that ligament which does not occur as it should: either because of the surplus tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or due to an excessive embrocation inappropriate for its time; or because of the scarcity of blood in a weakened body and its frailty.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 "And the treatment for that is to feed the sick person and make their body tender until blood multiplies within them.
Et administra balneum.	 "And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 "And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 "Then place sulfur on the limb so that it may attract a great amount of nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 "And apply constant embrocation with warm water until the nourishment flows and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 "Regarding the healing of bent bones when they are restored in a crooked manner.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 "When a limb already restored after its healing has crookedness and the prominence of the fractured bone or knotting: and it is marred in that form of body parts, however it does not prevent the part from performing its natural operation: then you should not accept the speech which assumes that the limb will break anew.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 "And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who did this on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 "And indeed, this operation is greatly blameable, leading to death or great fear that it is mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if the claudication and swelling are recent: then one should be bathed with warm water in which soaked herbs that soften have been cooked, such as the leaves of yarrow, its root, and mallows, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 And let an ointment be made with a soothing plaster, like the one made of henbane, properly prepared.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or let a slime be taken from the root of yarrow and stirred with goose fat or sesame oil, and applied with it as an ointamo.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or let they take the fat of figs and rub with white lead, and apply similar ones which are called from diminishing congealing medicines.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And the swelling is loosened with constant rubbing, ancient and gentle, which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 And administer a movement of the limb to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 But if a twisting has already preceded it, and become strong, and turned into a stone, and the need for its cure was provoked with iron: then it is necessary to cut above it, and dissolve continuation of bone, and incise what protrudes from nodulation or bone with subtle scissors: and administer ease in this with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 § From speech on dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the outcome of certain joints being out of their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 Why it is forbidden from its own motion and spoils the shape of limbs.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And causes intense pains to happen on the sickly one, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 Whenever a dislocation happens to anyone, then it must hurry to its restoration: do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 For if delayed, the place is left behind, and perhaps with that reduction of dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it is not necessary for it to move or be extended at the time of its inflammader.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Since it often causes a spasm and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 However, when this occurs, it is necessary to hasten to perform venesection by the nurse.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it should be dismissed until the inflammation subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then bathe the limb with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then gently reduce it.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And care for the entire limb as if nothing happened at its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 Indeed, I have already ordered chapters on dislocations, even following the progression of an injury from upper to lower parts of the body.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 ¶ On treating a lower jaw dislocation.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 Two lower jaws are rarely displaced.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 And dislocation of the temporomandibular joint occurs in one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 Or indeed they are slightly removed from their places and softened to some extent.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or they are fully dislocated until softened to the chest part, until a nurse can run over it, and cannot hold it, nor close their mouth, and is rolled out with their tongue while speaking.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 But when that displacement is slight, then it returns to several dispositions by itself with a few treatments.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 However, if it is complete and total displacement: then one must administer its reduction quickly, and not delay fully; and that the nurse holds their head: and inserts a doctor's single thumb into the root of Mandibular joint dislocation between the bones, if the displacement is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or they insert their two thumbs at once, if the dispunction is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the remaining fingers of his hand are placed outwardly to stabilize them.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the patient to cleanse his jawbones and make them suitable for chewing on every side.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the doctor straightens the mandible and moves it until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both mandibles are involved at once: then administer a poultice with warm water and oil, until the reduction of the jawbones becomes easy; do not make any reductions too slowly, as we have said before.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 And so when they return and align properly, the wound of the patient is closed, but not softened: then place small cloths over them, with a bandage made from beeswax; and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 And it should then be bound easily with soft bands.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And the patient should have sleep on his back: and his head should be held between two bandages so that it does not move to the right or left; nor should he be forced or allowed to chew anything: indeed, he should take in his food gently until pains subside and the mandible is loose; then he may eat what he wants, and administer medicine easily.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He should not work during eating and drinking, and sleep until the mandible loosens and heals.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If it is difficult to reduce two dislocated mandibles at some point and they do not return to their places: then there are often fevers that follow from this; and a constant thirst: and perhaps the patient's spleen releases, and perhaps he vomits clear bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 And so when you see that: then know it is a loss; and the person to whom this happens often dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Regarding the reduction of dislocations of the furcula and arm ends.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 2eb. (Note: Without additional context from
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 Chapter 26. Indeed, the wishbone is not dislocated from its inner side due to its continuous connection with the breast.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 And it can sometimes be dislodged externally; and that is described as follows. (Note: This translation assumes a continuation of Albucasis's work discussing possible
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 And its restoration involves it lying weak on its back and extending its arms. (Note: This translation refers to a method described by Albucasis for treating an injured wishbone.)
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then compress the site with your strong hand, for it will return itself. (Note: This translation reflects a technique from Albucasis's surgical practice related to setting bones.)
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place over the plaster, and small bandages, and bind it tightly. (Note: This is a typical instruction from Albucasis's era on securing a dressing or splint.)
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, the extremities that follow (extend from) the elbow continue with it and do not dislocate unless rarely. (Note: This statement likely pertains to anatomical observations made by Albucasis regarding joint articulations.)
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 Which if it is displaced on any day: then one must ensure that it is reduced and aligned as we have described, and prepared in the manner provided for you. (Note: This sentence gives guidance to a surgeon regarding steps to take when a dislocation occurs.)
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place over it a plaster, and bandages, and a binding. (Note: This instruction is part of the method for setting or immobilizing an affected area after reduction.)
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And instruct the patient to adhere to peace and rest until healed. (Note: This is a common closing remark in Albucasis's treatments that emphasizes the importance of rest for recovery.)
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment, the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it has also been separated from its place. (Note: This likely refers to instructions for reducing a dislocation at the shoulder joint.)
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 § On the reduction of a dislocation of the humerus. (Note: Here, we might expect Albucasis to
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27. (Note: Without additional context from the text
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the humerus is not dislocated unless by three methods. (Note: This would introduce a section where Albucasis specifies different mechanisms of dislocation for the humerus.)
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 Of which one is that it dislocates to the lower end of the ball and socket joint. (Note: This statement likely explains a specific type of shoulder dislocation Albucasis details in his work.)
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 Secondly, it should be dislocated to the chest side.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the humerus: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it should not be dislocated towards the back, due to the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it should not be dislocated toward the front, because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 And indeed very often it is dislocated and slips downward toward the anal region: especially in those whose flesh is scarce.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Since it quickly proceeds out of them, and just as quickly enters again.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 However, in those whose flesh is abundant, the opposite occurs, namely because it proceeds out with difficulty and enters again with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And sometimes it happens in some people due to a blow or accident and the humerus becomes inflamed with heat and is assumed to be because of this fact that it was already displaced.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you should examine this thing until certainty is obtained about it and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 And the displacement is known when it is towards the anal region: and you distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerum.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you found among them manifest difference, and in the head of the humerus you find concavity, and under the anal region at touch it appears as though the head of the humerus itself were absent: and the weak person cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it with any motion.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if displaced towards the chest or upwards: then you find a manifest touch, which is not hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And indeed this displacement can be easily reduced when it is recent, or the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 And its reduction is as follows: that he guides his hand upwards with a spatula.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under the anal region of that thing and guide the joint with strength upwards to its own position: and let him guide his hand with it and stretch it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then he should place it lower down; for indeed he returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 But if he does not return through that which we mentioned, and there are several days from the beginning when dislocation occurs: then it is necessary for him to bathe sickly in warm water, and administer an embrocation that soothes and alleviates, as if boiled roots were strained into the water, along with fenugreek and mallow.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then let the sick person lie on their back: and place under the tickling sphere and wool, which is equal in softness and tightening.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then let the doctor place their heel over the sphere, and loosen the neck of the shoulder with strength, and draw the hand of the sick person towards the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And let another servant hold the head of the sick person, so that it does not move to the lower parts: for indeed he returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if possible, guide him back according to this method: and it is as to make present men who are taller than the sick person, stand on one side, and insert their arm under the tickling of the sick person: and loosen the tickling towards the upper parts until the sick person is suspended in air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant draws the hand of the sick person to his lower rib.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 But if the sick person is light: then it is necessary for him to be suspended with something else so that he may feel burdened: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And he is also guided back according to another method: and it is as if he were fashioned on the ground with a long piece of wood whose head is round like a pottery sleeve: which is not thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then let be placed under the sick person after placing clothes gently over the head of the wood: and let the sickwart stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then let his hand be extended to the lower part on one side, and let his body be extended on the other side with strength: for the joint returns quickly to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If it is difficult to reposition it as we have described, then use this method with care: the wood should be of a length equal to the quantity of two forearms, its width equivalent to the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness equal to the quantity of two fingers; the head should be round in order to facilitate entry into the depth of the wound according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then the bandages are tied loosely above the rounded head with soft cloths so as not to injure the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then it should be placed under the weakened wound so that the hand or arm is extended to reach up to the bottom; and it should be fastened with wood over the support, arm, and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then the arm should be placed over the width of the ladder step and extended to reach downward; and the remaining body weight should be let down from one side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 However, the connection is made immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 Thus when the entrance is completed in whatever possible way it can be: then you should place under the wound a ball equal in quantity of woolen yarn.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place an applied plaster prepared from mill powder and frankincense on the entire upper arm as it recoiled upwards.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then a fitting bandage should be tightly tied under the wound; and the ligament should recoil over the plaster from above: then it should be attached to its own neck, and let down without moving its hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it should be placed food that nourishes the weak foot until it is comforted by its limb; for this hastens its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then a larger bandage should be placed after seven or five days, and one should get up with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it then becomes firmer and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If however the connection becomes dislocated many times, because of moisture that happens to it or due to another cause: then you should administer there a caustic with three openings as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done completely and the ligament is dissolved after seven days, and the joint does not heal, and the bandage is reduced several times, and it does not solidify, but gives way, and one cannot elevate it to above: then you know that the nerves of his who are near the head of the shoulder are already cut, extended, or softened; and you know that the joint will never join again in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 However, dislocations that occur towards the chest and nipple, or backward reduction, occurs with thrusting and extending with hands: until it returns, and a bandage is applied there as well as care, until healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 But if this happens after healing, heaviness in the limb and slowness of its movement, then it is used often to weak baths until that heaviness relaxes, and returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 § On curing elbow dislocations.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 Know that the joint of the elbow is displaced with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty as well: indeed it is displaced to all parts, especially towards the front or back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under sight and touch, according to whatever shape it becomes displaced.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when the joined elbow is displaced with a healthy one, it is declared to you manifestly.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 For indeed the joint contracts and cannot double the arm nor touch its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 And you must hurry to reduce the displacement immediately before a hot abscess occurs in him.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 For if this happens to him as a hot abscess, it is difficult for his reduction: and perhaps he does not cure at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For indeed it is worse than all kinds of displacements, and they have more intense pain from them: and often descends with that death.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 Then its restoration, when it can be reduced from those that are possible, is to extend its hand with two hands: and its arm is spread out, and the doctor's hands are above and below it, and he pushes the joint along with his own thumbs at the same time or at the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front: then it returns in such a way that its hand doubles with his own hand, until he hits with the root of his palm the arm which has been dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not oblige to reduction, then he administers strong and vigorous stretching: and it is so that two attendants extend its arm; and they hold it with both hands as well, so that it may not slip off during the stretching.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then its arm is restored to all parts after it has been rolled up with a long cloth or broad bandage on his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the doctor touches the joint with his own hand, he anoints it with oil; so that it may be one of those that help in providing lubrication to the joint for ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then he pushes the joint with vigorous thrusting until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 And after its restoration, it should be placed on top of the plaster itself, which has astringency and decoction with millet husk; and tightly bound bandage is applied appropriamely.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 And its arm is hung from the bed of the patient: and it should be released for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it should be dissolved.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If however the joint is fixed in its place, then dissolve that bandage and release it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see the joint is not well bound, then repeat the plaster and bandage, and release it for several days until tightly bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then dissolve it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If however there is swelling after the reduction of the joint and the situation is in motion: then administer moisturizing in bathing, gentle friction, and compression, until it lignifies, or place over the joint jilti, that is, sheep'amoeba ice cream.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then it is tied, and let it rest on itself during the day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it and insert into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 Therefore when it sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then apply over itself jilti one, and second, and third time at bathing entrance until soothening.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if so, place over itself dung of goat's wool, moist, heated with butter, and bind tightly to it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Do that several times. (This is the last instruction in Latin)
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 For she herself soothens, and returns to her own disposal. (The final outcome of the procedure according to the text.)
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 § About treating the dislocation Albucasis. (This seems like a header for additional instructions or context related to Albucasis's treatment methods.)
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX. (A reference number indicating where this section
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 Albucasis arms are often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and hand. (This appears to be a statement introducing the topic of arm dislocation in relation to Albucascases's treatments.)
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 And the reduction of its dislocation is easy. (A continuation from the previous line, indicating that treating this particular type of dis
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, other joints. (This seems to begin a comparison between different types of joint treatments.)
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, speed must be in the reduction of its dislocation at the time it becomes dislocated before the place can swell up: or a hot swelling happens there. (Here we see advice on how to act promptly during arm dislocation.)
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 And the reduction of dislocation is such that you place Mahassem's weak arm on a table and extend it with your hand: and the doctor places his own palm over the bulge of the joint, and pushes until it returns to position. (This sentence appears to be an instruction for performing a specific treatment maneuver.)
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 However, it is necessary to consider if the palm has already withdrawoff from the hand's forearm: then place the weak back of his own hand on a board near extension and reduction; and if there is an ongoing dislocation towards the back of the hand, then position that hand internally over the board, that is, the inner part of that hand should be placed over the board so that the doctor's hand falls upon the same prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 However, if it returns immediately, that is good; and if not, then bind it tightly with a soothing ointment for the sore and release it, without any bandages on that.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it cannot tolerate, nor can you go over its reduction after some days have passed, yet the joint remains according to its own crookedness; and nothing harms the sick person except that it soothes his hand, and he cannot be bound: then know, the nerves are either cut off or worn away.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in this except that it should be tightly seared with a caustic near the site of its injury.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it does not provide anything at all.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 But if Al-Mahasen does not return, then place over that ointment which we have mentioned.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then it is bound and released after five days; afterwards it is loosened and released, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 But if motion is impeded and something of importance occurs therein: then gently bathe it with warm water, and rub occasionally until softened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Regarding the treatment of digit dislocations.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a digit is dislocated towards any of its parts, or towards the back of the palm or forearm: then extend the digit and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then support the head of the finger and suspend it toward the side to which it is dislocated, and release it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then hang it up and extend it until it straightens on that day itself.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When the night comes, bind it as described above: and do not cease to loosen it during the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do that for several days until it is taut.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do the same for him if he is dislocated to the wrist of the hand: and bind it to the said part, and perform with him your first procedure until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And similarly do that for him when he is dislocated to other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 § Of the treatment of spinal column dislocation.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When it happens to someone a spinal column dislocation or a complete neck dislocation with many vertebrae displaced from their places: then there is no cure for him, since death approaches the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of that is that the sick person goes out in a state of waste without will, and cannot keep it: and often they become softened from him some limbs of his, or two legs of his, or two arms of his, or one of them: or a vertebra moves away from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For often it is displaced that often the removal happens to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Thus what moves towards the back is called humpiness.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 However, its treatment is that then you consider if humpiness happens from childhood: then there is no cure for him at all, nor healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 In that however which happens by chance, or by blows, or similar things, the old have already said long treatments in words.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 The use of which yields little with practice.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 But indeed I have already obtained permission from him, which little excuses by its nearness to my intent: and from my explanation in which I exposed that, and the shaping of his instrument differently from what they showed it and explained.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say, that in the swelling which occurs on the previous part, there is no talent or healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly in those occurring to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And they are not treated from them unless those occurring in the back properly, as I narrate: and it is so that it extends weak over its face on a level near the wall: and spreads underneath a wet lining, so that it does not hurt its chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then a straight wood is to be placed fixed into the hole on the ground at about the head of its foot: and another wood approximately at its feet at the other end of its foot: and the attendant holds the wood, not being fastened in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And the second servant holds the other one.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then over the head of the sick one is drawn a string loosely, and extended at its ligament below tightly: and extends the end of the ligament to the wood which is near its head: and binds it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then a string over its wings, and above its knees, and at its heels.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then all the strings are tied together, and they bind them to the other wood which is near its feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then each servant extends to the strings at the wood's side of the string: and do not remove the two woods from their places where they are fixed: but truly they are not fastened, as I said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the doctor puts his hands with strength over the spine until it returns: or he places them on a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then he attaches his feet to a board until he is restored.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If however he does not recover through this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three cubits.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And cut into the wall of which we spoke that is near the patient, a place where the board can be inserted.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then put the middle board over the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And the physician should then place his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tighten well, until the spine is curved, and he returns to his position.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then if you wish, work with a turner as follows: it is to make two pieces of wood on the ground next to the head of the patient, whose length is equal to one cubit; and also at the end of his feet two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And the length between all pieces of wood is one span; and now an opening has been made everywhere where the turner's wheel runs through; and fix every piece of wood to the ground firmly so that it may not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 And insert a round piece of wood; and the turner's wheel is in which the ligament turns through two openings between the pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at the end there is an opening where they fix a piece of wood, whose length is one span as it turned through; and in the two other pieces of wood also similar to this.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tighten the ligaments that you have strapped on the patient's chest with a turner who is at his head; and also the ligaments that you have strapped on his shanks with a turner who is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then stand near each turner's wheel with the lever, and use your hand to turn the wheel as it turns; and the physician straightens the spine according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of using a turner that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then, after Spondilus returns and the place is leveled, you must then set an ointment of linseed with white of egg.
Deinde stuppam.	 Next, make a plaster.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place upon the ointamoan a plate made from wood whose width be three fingers or about that size.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length and quantity should cover the space of Gibbositas, and above part of the healthy Spondilus.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with a bandage as we mentioned before.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 And let the sick be nourished with subtle food until healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 And if something remains protruding at the end of healing in that place: then it is necessary to administer medicines which soothe and relieve with the application of a board as I mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now apply a plate of lead there.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 And sometimes it happens that there is a protrusion at the very end of Spondilus's back: and it is thought to be through displacement, and that bone which now stands out.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 For it should not be presumed for him with this medicine: indeed perhaps it would bring death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 On the healing of a displaced Ancha.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joints of the Ancha and those of the shoulder do not occur, except for displacement alone: nor does it happen to them what happens to other separated and compressed joints.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 And indeed the joint of the Ancha is displaced according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 That is because it is displaired towards the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 And mostly at all it is displaired inwards: and little displaired to the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the cure of its inward displacement is as follows: because when you unite a healthy leg with an infirm one, it is longer: and that knee stands out more than that which is sound, and cannot double up its foot at the groin: and there is a place following the inflamed groin due to this, because the head of the hip has already arrived in that area.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the mark of its external displacement is that they are contrary to those conditions.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign of its displacement to the front is that it expands a healthy leg according to complementation: however, it does not duplicate without pain in the knee: and if one attempts to walk on it, they cannot manage over the front area: and urine retention occurs, and there is swelling in the groin, and during walking there is pressure under the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of its displacement to the back is that it does not expand the knee, nor can it duplicate before swelling in the groin occurs: and one leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and there is a headache at the hip joint.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 However, consider this reduction of these types of displacements, that if the displacement is old, it has become outdated with having it for a long time.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its nature: then there is no treatment at all for it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, one should not make the assumption that it is entirely healed.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 However, in the case where the displacement is recent and it is from one of four types of dislocanguards: then do this promptly so that you can join the joints together, extend it to the interior and exterior, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return on its own, and does not require any other treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If however it does not return in this way, then one must prepare a strong remedy, and extend its leg from the lower part: or with his own hands, or with a band that is tied over its leg above the knee: and another servant should extend their hand downwards so as to insert their fingers under its ticklish areas.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then tie with a band gently over the hip bone root, and hold the other end of the ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And its extension is either from the front part of the groin to the forequarter, or from the back part to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And its extension is all in one piece, until it loosens and remains hanging with the body from the ground.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 For this type of extension is a common type among four kinds of extensions.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If therefore there's a relapse to the displacement as we mentioned earlier, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary for each kind of extension its own proper treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Indeed, in reducing that particular displacement when the displacement is towards the inside, it must be placed on its healthy side lying down.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then place a ligature over the root of the hipbone, where it is between the head of the hip bone and below the groin area.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the ligature upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, towards the forequarter.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then let another strong helper take its arms and reduce the swollen area of the disabled hip, and stretch it towards the outward extension firmly.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now then it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 This type is easier among the remaining types of treatment, which reduces this limb.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 But if he is not cooperating with you and does not comply to enter this entire type of treatment: then it must be, for two feet sick at once with a strong ligament over the calcanei (heels), and a weak one; and its length equal to four digits from his healthy side. And let the extension of the sick foot be longer than another by twice the size of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then hang the disabled person over the neck of a beam, which is inside the house; and let its length from the ground equal twice the size of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to guard the hipbone; and when you find another one with the disabled person: let another young man push him while he is securing the hip joint firmly because the connection returns quickly to its place.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 However, in treating it itself, when there is a dislocation towards the outside, one must ensure that the sick person lies on a platform, as we described for those with humpbacks.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And it binds the ligament over its leg and chest of itself.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then two planks are placed, one at its feet and another at its head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then an additional plasto is placed in the middle of its foot and secured well: on top of which wet cloths should be laid so as not to injure the sick person; and the wood should be between its thighs so that it does not pull towards the lower part during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then every assistant extends their own part, and the physician makes the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If it thus follows back to its position, that will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place on top of the plank and press it as we mentioned with humpbacks, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that the sick person lies on its own healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it must be extended quickly on its leg: and according to this same description atop a platform: and the physician places his right hand's palm over the sick person's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then it is compressed with his other hand and with that compression places it extended towards the lower part of the knee joint.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary for it to be extended downwards, and should be elevated on the ground; rather it must lie on a hard surface, as we also said earlier when discussing its lying between two humps: and over its face with tension of ligaments: according to what we mentioned recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that compression with a plank also be administered over the joint to which the dislocation has occurred, when completion of reduction occurs as needed.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is, that you extend two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person grips his leg, and expands it without excuse, then you know it has returned to its member as it should be: then join the two thighs together, and place a plaster, and bind with an emberlock, that is, a rope; so that the leg does not move at all towards any part: and let the sick person adhere to rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then dissolve the ligament, and apply plaster, and compare one leg with the other; then if you see them equal while at rest, then you know that the dislocation is now fixed: therefore let the sick person walk again.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 And if you see some softening: then make it return, and apply that plaster, and bind it according to your first bandaging; and let it also rest for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then dissolve it and make the person walk slowly on each foot for two more days, until it is well healed.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 ¶ Concerning Knee Dislocanguisf.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The Knee is displaced in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is displaced to the outside, the inside, and below (namely towards the back).
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it does not displace to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 And the sign of its displacement is that you instruct the sick person to apply their leg onto their hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If however it does not stick with the thigh: then you know that the Knee is displaced.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all kinds of its displacement is to make the sick person sit upright, so that it can already extend its leg if possible onto yours and stick its back against your face; and place his foot between your feet. (Note: This translation instruction seems to be incomplete or improperly structured based on Albucasis's actual works)
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then fasten your knee together with your palms, and straighten those between your fingers over that knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply it with the palm of your hand on both sides of that knee firmly.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another assistant should stretch out his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 And the sign of return is that the leg clings with the thigh gently, not strenuously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply plaster on it and make the leg stick to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind it together with bandages for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then loosen it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And the patient should not walk lame for several days until healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 But if it refuses to be reduced by you, then provide strong extension with ligaments, whose precedence is not described in the treatment of ankles, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 ¶ Regarding the treatment of a heel displacement.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel is sometimes thrown off by slight shaking and at other times becomes displaced following a particular treatment.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 And its displacement occurs either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 And the sign of its displacement is that you see the heel swollen and extending toward the side to which it becomes displaced.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 But the cure of its displacement is an easy return: and it is by stretching out gently with your hands and making equal until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 But during its treatment when it becomes displawed following a particular treatment, you should make the patient sit straight and let a strong assistant hold it firmly on his back, in the middle of itself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then with your right hand hold his foot from its upper part and with your left hand from its lower part at the heel's place.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then by two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then extend with the left hand and push the chest with the right foot against the thigh without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Then do that twice, as we have told you.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the chabest foot against the thigh with a force three times, and you will extract the bone fragment.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If therefore he returns with the force of one or two as described here and you see the foot even, that is good; but if not, then repeat the operation on him: for indeed he will return.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If however it is forbidden to you the reduction of him as we have said: then let the sick person lie on his back on the ground and fix a stake firmly in the earth so that he falls between his thighs: and you now wrap a cloth around him so that he does not injure the sick.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let the attendant take his thighs: then the other attendant should stretch one foot with their own hands or with a band that is tied over his calf.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then all attendants should stretch against the extension of his companion: and the stake stands between the two thighs of the sick person holding him so that his body is not attracted towards the lower near the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with their own hands and another attendant holds the healthy leg towards the bottom.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 When however the dislocation returns and it is declared to you that he has regained health: then place a plaster and bandage, and tighten it with strong bands, and bind his foot with a band to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And it is necessary that you check or cut the nerves that are above the heel backward, so that there be not a swollen ligament over them and damage them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let him rest for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 But if the ligament is softened, then tighten him again: and let them bathe him on the third or fourth day: and forbid the sick from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 If indeed he wishes to walk before that space of time, there is no assurance but that the dislocation will be resolved and it will become corrupted, and will not receive any healing afterward.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If it happens to him a hot abscess: then he needs to administer an ointment on the sore area, as our treatment was described elsewhere, and rubbing until removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Concerning dislocation of the toe fingers, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It should be that which is dislocated from those with little extension without effort: and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 But if the dislocation is in certain knots of the back of the foot: then it should be made to sit with its own weakened foot on an even surface of the ground or over a board: and it stands as walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand and place your foot on that which protrudes from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then the heel with your foot with strength, until it returns, and you see it already even, and not protrudes in the place of prominence.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then place under his thigh a board that takes his foot entirely, which has two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it tightly with a decent bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then loosen it and make him rest from walking for many days until it is strained and secured by the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 Concerning types of dislocations with ulcers or fractures.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something happens to this, and you try its treatment, and restoration of itself, many times death succeeds: and for this reason it should not presume over this kind of cure, unless he is prudent in the art with long use, merciful, pious, slow, not daring, nor arrogant: and to use medicines that calm only hot abscesses, and to send away the weakened by divine judgment for a long time.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you hope or expect healing from destruction with mild illness, and where something appears to be hopeful.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore do the reduction of it immediately at the beginning of the thing before a hot suppurate occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If therefore the member returns as we wish, then apply a treatment that calms suppuration: and care for wounds with what suits it from dried ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 That if dislocation is with fracture, and it occurs in separated bone shards, then try the removal of them, and do what we have said in simple illnesses from what preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your strength, and guard yourself from the approach of fear: according to what my prediction preceded for you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For that is better for you with your Maker, and more lasting to your glory, and more of your body's health with them at your time.
