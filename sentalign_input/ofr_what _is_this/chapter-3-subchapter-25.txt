of the furcula/clavicle (or possibly a forked instrument)
The clavicle cannot be dislocated from the rib cage internally at the joint and breastbone, and is sometimes dislocated externally, and it is easily felt. 
And the restoration is as follows: the patient lies flat on his back, and extends his arms; and then press firmly on the area with your palm, and it will return; then apply the plaster and bandage, and tighten it; and the part that is near the elbow cannot be dislocated; if however, it is dislocated, reposition it, as we have said; then apply the plaster and bandage, and tighten it, and tell the patient to rest until he is healed; and the same is done for the head of the shoulder, when it is separated from its place.
