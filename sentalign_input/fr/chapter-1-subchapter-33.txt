of menstruation
When there is a bowel disorder due to cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive faculties in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and it cannot be treated by usual methods; and you see the patient enduring and of strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach as mentioned earlier with the circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the navel with a subtle clavile cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient is enduring, make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, because the treatment is effective when there is good help.
