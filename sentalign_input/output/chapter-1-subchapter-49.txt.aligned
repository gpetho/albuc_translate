When the disease called "albaras" is chronic, and medical remedies are of no use, then cauterize it with a somewhat deep cautery, according to the thickness of the flesh, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed; then treat it with vetch flour and lentil flour with rose oil and plantain leaves, and dove's blood and lark's blood, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and bound with a cloth, and applied to the area until it is healed.	When leprosy is of long standing and no device of medicine has any effect upon it, make a cauterization over it to a slight depth according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness has gone and the colour of the skin altered. Then treat with lentil flour, oil of roses, arnoglossa leaves, and pigeons' or swallows' blood, of each equal parts mixed all together and spread on lint; let this stick to the place till healed.	0.80754495
