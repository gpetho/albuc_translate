Chapter seventy-three on the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pimples that appear on women's genitals.
As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the mouths of the veins until much blood flows from it constantly.
So when hemorrhoids become chronic, they become warts, and I have mentioned in the classification their types and signs, and we mention here what accepts treatment from them and what does not accept treatment.
So I say that if the hemorrhoids and warts are in the depth of the uterus and have not appeared to the senses, then there is no treatment for them with iron.
And what is of them in the mouth of the uterus, the senses fall upon it, it is what is treated.
So it is necessary that the woman enter a cold room then stretch the warts with tweezers or with a rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Then sprinkle on it, when the blood flows, one of the styptics that stop the blood without cauterization, such as acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, and the like.
Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour then hang them in cold water.
Then if the bleeding continues, make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like.
Then take barley flour and knead it with honey and vinegar and apply a bandage with it on her back.
Then if the bleeding stops, and if not, then adhere to cupping the back and the breasts without scarification.
Then take wool and immerse it in purslane juice or plantain juice or blackberry branch juice with gallnut drink and apply it to the area.
Then when the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it heals.
As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of snakes, rough in appearance.
So it is necessary to cut what appears of it according to what I mentioned about the warts exactly and treat it until it heals.
