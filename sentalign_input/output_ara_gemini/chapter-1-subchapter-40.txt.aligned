Chapter forty on cauterizing hip dislocation.	CHAPTER FORTY. On cauterization of a dislocated hip.	0.8192059
Erroneous/Harmful humors may flow to the hip joint, causing it to be dislocated.	Sometimes harmful humidities reach the hip joint and result in its coming out of its place.	0.5449657
And its sign is that one leg becomes longer than the other when you compare them to each other. And you find a gap at the site of the dislocation.	The symptom of this is that one leg is longer than the other when one is measured against the other; and a hollow is found there [i.e. at the hip].	0.7448597
It is necessary to cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself with a semi-circular cautery after marking with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the center of the circle.	Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.	0.85143363
And use the cautery whose image is presented in stomach cauterization.	The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach.	0.5483243
If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it three times with the large olive-shaped cautery.	But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery.	0.78665155
And make the depth of the cauterization equal to the thickness of the entire skin.	The burn should be to the depth of the whole thickness of the skin.	0.5680916
Then treat him until he recovers, God willing.	Then dress till healed.	0.5701921
