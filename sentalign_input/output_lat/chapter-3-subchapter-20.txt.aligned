On the treatment of knotting in the scar of a fracture.	On the treatment of the callus that remains from a fracture.	0.7612338
This knotting often occurs in the scar of a healed fracture. Especially when near the joints, it distorts the shape of the limb. It may even prevent the limb from functioning naturally.	This callus often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially one near a joint, and thereby the shape of the limb is spoilt; and sometimes there is limitation of the natural function of the limb.	0.83896506
Therefore, if the knot is recent, apply medicines with astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar substances.	Examine it, and if the callus be soft, apply astringent remedies to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, balsam of sarcocol, acacia, and the like.	0.7450391
Take some or all of these, mix them with astringent wine, egg white, or vinegar, and apply them over the knot in tow, binding them tightly.	Take some or all of these; beat them up with a dry wine or egg-white or vinegar, apply to the callus on some tow and bind up firmly.	0.9117633
Leave the binding on and do not loosen it for many days. Then loosen it, reapply another, and repeat until the knot disappears.	Leave the bandaging on for many days; then undo it and repeat until the callus is removed, God willing.	0.7787751
Or bind a lead plate over it firmly. Lead has the property of removing all such concerns from the limbs.	Or bind on it a firm sheet of lead; for lead has the property of taking away lumps from limbs.	0.81802034
If the knot has hardened into stone and is constricting, and there is an urgent need to remove it, then cut it from above and remove the protruding excess, or shave it down with certain rasps until it is gone, and treat it until it heals.	But if the callus is stony hard and its removal is urgent, incise the place and cut away the superfluous prominence, or pare it away with a scraper until it is gone; and dress the wound until it heals.	0.7489899
