Dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, because of which it cannot move, and the limb is deformed, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.	A dislocation is a displacement of any of the joints from its place, whereby the movement of the joint is hindered, the member is deformed, and the patient is caused violent pain and hurt.	0.8505253
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced immediately without delay.	When anyone sustains a dislocation he should hasten to have it reduced, not delaying it at all.	0.789722
For if one delays, the place swells, and perhaps it is difficult to put it back in place; therefore, it should not be moved while it is swollen: it often causes spasms and other pains; however, when this happens, bleed the patient, then leave it until the swelling has subsided; then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then reduce it gently, and treat each limb as the treatment comes to its place.	For if it is delayed the place will swell up and the reduction will be thereby made difficult. So it should not be delayed, nor moved or extended during the time it is swollen, for that often leads to spasm and excruciating pain. Instead, when this occurs, you must hasten to venesect the patient, and then let be until the swelling has subsided a little. Then massage the member with hot water and oil and let it be gently reduced.	0.8912549
And I have arranged the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.	I have disposed the chapters on dislocations in the same order as the foregoing ones on fractures, that is, from the upper part of the body to the lower part.	0.6037712
