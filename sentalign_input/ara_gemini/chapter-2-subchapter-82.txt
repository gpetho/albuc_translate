Chapter eighty-two on the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts, and corns.
A corn is a round knot, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, that forms throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.
It should be incised around the corn and grasped with tweezers or a hook and removed from its root, then treated.
And if you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter.
As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, dense, round protuberance on the surface of the body, and frequently occurs on the hands of children.
Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it as described previously with fire or a sharp medicine.
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument that I mentioned in the treatment of moles.
As for a mole, it is also a small, dense, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going very deep, and if cold affects it, one feels in it something similar to the sting of ants, and it occurs throughout the body, mostly on the hands.
Its treatment is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong eagle feather, and place that tube on the mole until the circle of the tube surrounds it from all sides, then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the mole and make it go deep into the flesh, and the mole will be removed from its root.
And if you wish, you can do that with a copper or iron tube in this manner.
The top of the tube to the thin part should be solid and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to hold and twist it.
And if you wish, cauterize the fistula as described previously in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
