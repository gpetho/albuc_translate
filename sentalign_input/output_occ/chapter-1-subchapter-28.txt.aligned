On the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.	On incising a tumour of the liver with the cautery.	0.865742
When an abscess forms in the liver and you want to know if the abscess is in the liver tissue or in its covering, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient feels heaviness and pain without sharpness.	When there is an abscess in the liver and you are anxious to know if the tumour is in the body of the liver or in its capsule: if it is in the substance of the liver, the patient will be suffering from a feeling of heaviness and no very acute pain.	0.8242654
And if it is in the covering of the liver, the pain is sharp and sometimes the doctors are already exhausted by treating it.	But if it is in the capsule of the liver there will be the sharpest intensity of pain and you will see that it has baffled the doctors.	0.66642976
So the patient should be turned onto their back; then mark the place of the abscess with ink; and then heat the cautery which is shaped like a needle, the form of which was described on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire tendon is burned, until it reaches the covering, so that pus may escape.	Then the patient should lie back on his neck; then mark the place of the swelling with ink. Then heat the cautery in the fire, this being the cautery resembling a probe, of this form, and with that make one cauterization till the whole thickness of the skin is burnt through, finishing up at the capsule so that all the purulent matter comes out.	0.9004419
And then treat it as with other abscesses until it is healed.	Then apply the treatment for wounds.	0.46737352
And it is not suitable to use this form of cautery except by someone whose study in the art of medicine is advanced and who has treated many illnesses; this operation should only be attempted by experienced practitioners, but it is best to leave it to us.	This kind of cauterization should not be employed except by one who has a long experience of the medical art and who has frequent practice at dealing with this kind of disease. Then he can undertake this kind of operation. But in my opinion it would be better to pass it by.	0.80834323
