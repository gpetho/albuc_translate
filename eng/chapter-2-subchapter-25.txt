 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE.
On warts growing on the end of the nose.
 There frequently spring from the end of the nose warts that grow and increase daily till they disfigure the man.
So you should cut them out when they first appear; totally eradicate them and apply to the place cauterization, either actual or by caustic.
But if excision of them has been overlooked till they have grown big, then examine, and if the growth is stone-like, hard, and pale in colour, and with little sensation, do not interfere with it with an instrument, for it is a cancerous tumour.
For I have often seen people cut these tumours, and great affliction resulted to the sufferer.
But if the tumour be soft to the touch, not pale coloured, and you see it can be wholly removed, then purge the patient, and cut it off him fearlessly, and treat the place with astringents and styptics till healed.
