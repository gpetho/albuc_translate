Chapter Thirty-Eight
On extracting thorns and other things stuck in the throat.
Often a bone or fishbone or something else gets stuck in the throat, so you should remove what is visible and can be seen after pressing down the tongue with the instrument in sunlight.
What you cannot see and is hidden in the throat, you should have the patient vomit before their food is digested in their stomach. Perhaps the stuck object will come out with the vomit, or the patient can swallow a piece of turnip or the root of chicory.
Or they can swallow a bite of dry bread, or you take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a thread, and then they swallow it. When it reaches the location of the thorn, pull the string quickly. Do this several times. 
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out with what we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a probe and have a hook at its end.  The patient inserts it gently into their throat with their head raised upward, taking care not to touch their larynx so as not to cause coughing and dislodge the bone or thorn further. Or the physician inserts it with their hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the embedded object. They push downward or pull upward with the instrument, as they are best able, until it comes out.
