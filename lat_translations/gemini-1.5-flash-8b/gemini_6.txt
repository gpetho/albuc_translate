Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	Having completed for you, my children, this book, which is the last of the medical sciences with its completion, and having reached its end in its expositions and declarations, it seemed to me that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the operation, that is, surgery by hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery by hand is languishing in our region and in our time, quite private, perhaps its knowledge has perished, and its trace has been severed; and nothing has remained of it except small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which changing hands have altered; and error and hesitation have befallen them, until its intentions have been closed and its power has been estranged: It seemed to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise, in it, according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and that I should come with the forms of cautery instruments and the other instruments of the work: with the addition of declaration and the expedition of that which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, the reason why a good craftsman of it with his hand is not found in this time of ours is this: because the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be exercised beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, as Galen recounted, until he knows the helpings of the limbs, and their forms, and their conjunction, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and muscles, and their number, and their emergence, and of the pulsating and still veins, and their places of exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We however have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy is not prevented from falling into error, by which people are killed; just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess of the throat on a woman's neck, and cut some arteries in her neck; therefore the woman's blood flowed, until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man who had advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore, he reached it and extracted it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I myself had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the disposition of the sick man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I saw another physician, who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician hurried with his ignorance, and bound the fracture over the wound with cushions and splints with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound an exit.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he discharged him according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Afterwards he dismissed him for some days, and commanded him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood like that until his leg and foot became ulcerated, and he reached ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I was therefore called to him, and I hurried to loosen the bandage, and there followed tranquility, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become firm in the limb, and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, the corruption ceased to wander in the limb until it perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician, who perforated the cancerous ulcer: and it ulcerated after days, until its malice was magnified with its owner.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humour, then it should not be reached with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate the complete excision of it.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And for that, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that surgery with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is associated, and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already roused in every place of this book, where surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to diminish it, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of it.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and your patients with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading through the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy succession: and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing; and remove your souls from that which makes you afraid, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your advantage.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining for your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your rewards.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called bad physicians.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Concerning the cautery with fire, and the cautery with sharp medicine, treated and arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments and the tools of the cautery, and everything that is necessary in the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Second Chapter.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Concerning incision and perforation, phlebotomy and cupping, and wounds, and the extraction of arrows and similar matters: and everything treated and arranged with the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Third Chapter.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Concerning restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar matters: treated and arranged from head to foot, and the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.

Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery, and to which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time, and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before I recount the operations using it, it is necessary to state the nature of its benefits and harms, and in which temperament it should be applied.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the discourse on the nature of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discourse, requiring knowledge and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed; but for me, a little from their words suffices, fearing to prolong the discussion.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the cautery benefits universally every temperament, whether with or without material, except for the two temperaments which are hot without material, and dry without material.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in a hot and dry temperament with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite, namely that the cautery is not suitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable for being healed from a hot and dry illness with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite stated that through the cautery benefit is achieved in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And indeed I say, through his discourse, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However, it should not be applied to it unless he is already proven and skilled in the final exercise of the cautery chapter, and knows the diversity of human temperaments and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes and their occurrences, and the duration of their time.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, there is no fear concerning the remaining temperaments, and especially in illnesses that are cold and moist.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have now agreed upon them, and they have not disagreed in the benefit of cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know, children, that from the secret of treatment by cautery with fire, and its goodness upon cautery with burning medicine, is that fire is simple, whose action does not reach, unless to the limb that is cauterized; and does not harm another limb joined with it, except for small harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is elongated from the limbs; and perhaps causes illness of difficult healing, and perhaps kills, in the limb.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire, because of its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Now, however, that has become known to us through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and the standing upon the truth of things; and because of that, I am excused from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not so, because it is not permitted to this book of mine, I would present to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation on the bodies of its expulsion, by which it expels illnesses with a demonstrative philosophical discourse, which would be sharpened by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be performed, and they set a better time in the spring.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cautery is appropriate at any time, because the harm that happens because of the time is submerged in the benefit that is drawn with the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay, because it is feared from them that a greater harm may occur than the small harm entering because of the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And do not let it fall into your minds, O children, that the common people and foolish physicians fear that the illness cured by cautery does not always return, and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: for cautery is nothing but a place for medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humours which are the cause why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cautery excels medicine in the speed of its cure, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that the illness may return at some time, according to the patient's complexion, and the location of their illness, and its power, and what is prepared in their body from the aggregation of superfluities in it, and what arrives in them by their acquisition from foods, and things similar to these causes, unless it is an illness in which cautery is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in a limb, of few superfluities and humours, like the cautery of a tooth, because of pain, and things similar to it, for it is possible that that pain will not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But indeed the common people's saying, that cautery is the last resort in medicine, is a correct saying: not according to what they intend by it; because they believe that there is no cure that can compare to medicine, nor to anything else after the cautery has passed.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	However, the reality is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort in medicine is not, except that when we administer methods of treatment for some illnesses, and those medicines do not help; then we administer cautery in the end, and it does help; then from this it follows that cautery is the last resort in medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many simple-minded physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron; and they did not say that unless because of the equal weight of gold, and the excellence of its substance; and they said that the area of the cautery does not form pus.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But that is not absolutely so; because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you are heating cautery of gold in fire, it is not clear to you when it is heated according to the quantity you desire, due to the redness of the gold; and when it is quickly cooled, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire, and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls into that occupation [or: predicament] due to that; and because of this, cautery with iron is quicker and closer to us, for the correctness of the procedure.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters, and have arranged them from head to foot, so that they alleviate the one who seeks what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization contributes to the dominion of moisture and coldness over the brain; these two are the causes of headache, and of a multitude of flows of humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of much sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally every illness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, and headache, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, that you instruct the sick person to be evacuated first with a purging medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and their age, and their custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Wherever therefore your middle finger arrives, mark that place with the cautery.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire: whose shape is this.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, with a descent, whereby your hand is gradually tightened, and you will turn it.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see now exposed from the bone a quantity of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherbi, then raise your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another from it if it cools: until the bones are seen, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cotum in it, and place it upon the place: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked cotum upon butter, and leave it upon the place, until the eschar of fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with tetrapharmacon ointment, until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have now said that the more a wound remains open, the more it emits pus: wherefore it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone: and the cautery should be held, until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then that which is burned from the bone should be shaved off, then treated.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate with the cautery, until it presses an impression on the bone, so that the bone falls, which is done as if shaping a kirate; or an instrument that women place on an infused small alphabet: and they think that vapors of the head are exhaled from this place, and that the wound be left open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be treated until it is healed.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable except in some people, according to the path of caution.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the safety of him.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have witnessed in other limbs; and especially when the head of the sick person is naturally weak.  And indeed, the first type of cautery is more safe and better in my opinion, and I use it; therefore operate with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When chronic pain occurs in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and poultices.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the single cautery that we have described, and none of those things helps him, then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the sick person is of strong natural constitution, and not weak, and finds a violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery slightly beneath the previous one.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it above every horn of his head with a cautery, so that the skin is not pierced, and a quantity of bone is uncovered, as we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with a single cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the *vas*, which is the place where the cupping glass is placed; and elevate your cautery there, and do not uncover the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick person experiences a violent pain because of it, different from the pain of the other cauterizations of all parts of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I shall say this: The cautery in its place should be the cautery with which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head should be cauterized with a finer cautery than that used for the middle of the head.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a half-headache, both with cauterizing medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is purged with purifying medicines, and the remaining treatment, which I have described in the divisions of illnesses, is administered, and yet it does not benefit the entire condition: then cauterization is performed in it according to two methods: either by cauterization with a sharp burning medicine, or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	The cautery with sharp burning medicine is to take one garlic clove, and peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then, with a broad lancet, open the painful area for a time, until a space is made beneath the skin, into which the clove is placed.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into the space beneath the skin, until it is hidden; then bind it above with a suitable constriction bandage, and leave it for fifteen hours; then remove it, and take out the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; then apply to it a poultice soaked in butter, until the place produces pus; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish, do it with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	However, its cauterization with iron is according to this method.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	A cautery of fire, whose form is this.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a "clauilis," because the shape of its head is like that of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle there is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it upon the area, and hold your hand; and you revolve the iron slowly with speed; and let the amount that is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, like its half.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then soak the cloth in salt water, and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter; afterwards, treat with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-edge.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly an ancient one.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When treating hemicrania, with what we have said from the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and the treatment does not help: and you see from the illness that what we have said of the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient for it, then it is necessary to heat the cautery knife until it whitens after having marked the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or something like that; and place your hand on one side, and squeeze it until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, lest the side or the nerve which moves it be burned, whence spasm might result.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and cautious about the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its cutting is the danger, especially for him who does not know what he is doing, and is not studious, nor experienced: and he abandons the operation with it first of all.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with a reminder of the regimen of blood flow arising from the artery according to its manner, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the sick person tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with the cautery having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	Concerning the method of cauterization in earache.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When earache occurs from cold, and is treated with remedies, and the other treatment which we have said in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply a cautery to it: and that is what is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then, after its ignition, touch the points along the entire circumference of the ear, as it revolves; or, along the circumference of each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And draw back the cautery a little from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with the marking-ink; and let the amount of the cautery be ten points on each ear, and approximately that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the places until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	Concerning the method of cauterization in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture that is treated with cauterization is only of the kinds that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And avoid cauterization of the type that arises from desiccation and nerve spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torture with leeches, and head purgings, and gargles, and your treatment is unsuccessful, then you must cauterize the afflicted with three cauteries: one near the base of the ear, and a second a little lower on its temporal part, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur unless in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the tip of the upper ear, under the horn of the head a little: and another on the temporal part; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind of knife, whose form is already described: however, it is not much thinner than that, as you see: and it is necessary that the knife has a little excess thickness in it.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	Concerning the method of cauterization in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy is longstanding, and you have treated it with what we said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be as before.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also, cauterization is performed with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is the more ultimate one.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then let him be treated with what preceded.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	Concerning the method of cauterization in forgetfulness.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that large hyerae and pills that cleanse the brain be given first to the sick person in drink.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on his/her occiput a plaster of mustard, as described in the treatise on plasters; and apply it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is the method of cautery; and do it according to the same order that I have said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by it, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not, then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which shall descend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cautery, with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is tolerating it, then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him until he is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form that was stated previously.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.

Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hyeres, and with what we have said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If, however, in the illness there is a need for the softening of the body with more of those, and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and the last with a cautery, until most of it is burned from the skin, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for him until he is healed; and thus the cautery of Oliuare.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the rest of the treatment that we have described in the division: when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in the taking of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if it is a child, who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and cleansing mastications for the brain are administered, many days before, with the improvement of foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what preceded in the manner: and with another cautery in his occiput, and on every horn of his head with a cautery.

If, however, the sick person is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I have mentioned for the paralytic, and for the softening of the body on the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back: and let the olive cautery be in accordance with the manner that preceded.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity flowing towards melancholy, and the sick person's body is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what has preceded in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and afterwards make a neatly crafted bandage of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head, and the patient, sitting upright, must be held on all sides.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then apply the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is better made from old sheep's butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, which the finger can tolerate when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then apply it to the middle of his head in a circle, and leave it until it cools.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures in it, apart from which you should hold the cautery: indeed, it should be smelling.

When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have said in the division, then begin and treat the afflicted one, with that which will cleanse his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him from all humidities, and make him sit in a bath, in fasting for some days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then order him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if it is the beginning of the descent of water in both eyes simultaneously; or from one side, if it is the beginning of water in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin; and let the cauteries be as long as the width of the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from him, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the skill that is in extracting arteries, and cutting them, and caution from the flow of blood.

Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are chronic, persistent, and located above the veins and arteries that are on the visible exterior of the head, it is ascertained that it arises from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery as I described at the beginning for descending water, using one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on each temple, and two cauteries on the neck beneath the two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if it needs further treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye carefully, above the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery.

Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it, according to what we said in the division, and the treatment is not effective, then act quickly and give the sick person decoctions in a drink for three nights. Afterwards, shave his head and cauterize it with a medium cautery and an olive cautery.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then cauterize it with a claw-shaped cautery, using two cauteries, above the two eyebrows under the hair a little.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the softening of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cautery, using this crescent-shaped cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with a few cauteries on every side: and let them be distant from the two temples: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow: and do not place your hand with the cautery at the very end, but according to the amount that is to be burned of the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the shape of the cautery according to this crescent-shaped cautery method.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are inverted, pricking the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is in it according to two methods: either a cautery with fire, or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery with fire, beforehand, instruct the sick person to remove their own hairs, if they are among those who remove them, until they are elongated and made even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they prick him at their origin: then bind his eyes with a bandage, so that they do not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When therefore they are born and made even, then place the head of the sick person in your bosom; then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with ink, a sign that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, on the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape that you marked, gradually in many stages, until the surface of the skin, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is completely burned away.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the success of your work is that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place upon it a poultice with butter, until the scab is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then again cauterize that spot, as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
¶ De modo cauterizandi cum medicina comburente in eodem casu.	Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.

Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make a shape of a myrtle leaf from paper on cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take from known soap, and from unsoaked lime, each one ounce in weight, or approximately that; then grind them together thoroughly, and do it quickly so that it does not cool down.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then take some of that from the paste and place it over the paper you made, in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one eye, or two.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	And place under the eye a poultice soaked in egg white: and let the head of the sick person be in your bosom.

Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's bite: for its bite is found like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	As long as he finds that bite, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When the bite subsides, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And then consider, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised upon contraction with fire or with incision, it is well; and if not, then again put medicine upon the place where the medicine does not take hold and does not darken, until your operation is equal and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then apply a poultice with butter until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diaphanous ointment, or another, until it is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the final guard, lest something of the medicine fall into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	If the eyelid softens after days, and something of the hair fights in the eye, then again put medicine on the place which softens from the eyelid properly, as you did at first.

When you treat a fistula, if what we have said in the divisions of illnesses does not help your treatment, then you should cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	Tell the sick person to place their head in your lap, and let the attendant hold their head in their hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with their head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then place a heated Cotum, soaked in the white of an egg or in psyllium mucilage, over their eye.  Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be held upwards in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	Then express the fistula, if it is open, and draw out the pus from it, and dry it; and if it is not open, then open it and draw out its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	Then place the cautery, made very hot, upon it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold your hand with the cautery near the eye, towards the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is not disturbed; and you shall place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If therefore you arrive at the beginning of your cautery up to the opening, it will be good.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it, and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a poultice with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	If forty days have passed and it is not healed, then apply to it a sharp corrosive medicine until the opening is exposed, and scrape it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	Aim at the location of the fistula, and split it open; then place in the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a fine cannula, whose form is this.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	And pour into it a drachma of melted lead, and hold your hand with a good retention cannula, and let the sick person not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach his eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	And it is necessary that you place over the sick person's eye a cloth soaked in egg white, or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	For lead burns the location of the fistula, and heals it with a marvelous cure.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	If the fistula is cured with what we have said concerning the cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will be in its proper place.

Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called hairs, and especially in the lips of children.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you treat these fissures, with what we have said concerning the division of illnesses, and if treatment does not help, then use a small, knife-like cautery with fire, according to this form.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	Then quickly place the heated cautery on the fissures themselves until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissures.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	Concerning the method of cauterizing an oral fistula.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth; then it forms pus, and bursts; afterward it becomes chronic, and pus runs, and a fistula forms; then you treat it, and the treatment is of no avail, then it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery, according to its size.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its depth and its furthest point; do it once, or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	Then treat it afterward, with what we said about treatment until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	If therefore the pus is cut off and it heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come to its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help, then place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	Then with fire, a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula on the tooth: and quickly introduce the heated Cautery into it: and hold your hand for a little while, until the sick person feels the heat of the fire already having reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, according to your will.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	Then let the sick person fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour: and let them spit it out.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	Concerning the method of cauterization in toothache.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	When toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or a worm within, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then a cautery is applied to it in two ways: either a cautery with butter, or a cautery with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	However, its cautery with butter is that you should take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pan.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a stick, and wrap it around the tip of the probe.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, and hold it until it cools down; then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, immerse wool or a stick in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place burning iron on top of it, until fire reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	Its cauterization with fire is to apply a copper or iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then apply a cautery, whose shape will come: and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cautery cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on the same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary, in the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for an hour: then he should spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	Cauterize with whichever extremity of force as is possible: and this is the form of the Cannula.

Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	When Strophuls are from phlegm and cold humors, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and force their digestion quickly: then with a concave Cautery of fire, whose form is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open extremities, so that smoke may exit at the cautery from the other extremity; and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time, if that is not enough, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	Then treat it with tooth ointment until the form of the cannula is healed.

When humidities overcome the lung's passage, and especially when it is with a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the infirm be evacuated in the first place with loosening medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	Then cauterize it at the sore spot near the root of the throat in the depressed place: and be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor the skin, unless something of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last vertebra of it, bringing it to a final end: and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	On the method of cauterization in diseases of the Lung and Cough.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	When cough and lung disease are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have fever, nor consumption, and the disease is old, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork, in low, smooth, empty places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts: and let the cautery be of a cannula according to the form that preceded.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	And if your cauterization wishes to be by puncturing with a cautery, called a Point, whose form preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the points be from thirty points up to almost another.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with that which preceded, until he is healed.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this form.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	Therefore, the cauterization is alleviated when you do with it in one turn three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not settle into its position of return from its dislocation until it is accustomed to returning, then, subsequently dislocated by a slight movement, as we have already witnessed, it is necessary to first reduce the dislocation.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	Then the patient is laid supine on his back, or on his healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	Then lift the skin that is within the Titillico towards the top with your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	Then take a cautery with two prongs.
Cuius forma est haec.	Whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the figure of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	And sometimes a cauterization is made with a cautery having three prongs, therefore the figure of the cauterization then is of six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the fineness of the thread.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	And this is the form of the cautery having three prongs.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	And sometimes one is added above this way, therefore there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	Then place crushed leeks with salt upon the cautery.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	Then cause the infirm person to adhere to tranquility, so that the limb is not moved at any time until it is strengthened.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	And if the dislocation is upwards, and that rarely happens, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicular cautery, or with many cauteries by pricking.

Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	When cold and much moisture occur in the stomach, until they draw it out of its complexion, and phlegms multiply within it, and incessant methods of treatment are of no avail, then it is necessary that the sick person be laid on their back, and extend their legs and hands.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	Then cauterize with three cauteries, one cautery under the breastbone the size of one finger with a [small?] cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of one cautery, until the shape of the cauteries becomes triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	And lengthen [the cauteries] between each so that they do not join, when they will form pus.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cautery should be the quantity of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	And let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without addition; and if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form, then let the cautery with which this is done be one in the shape of a circle according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	And the stomach is cauterized by puncturing it for the one who is terrified by this cautery; and it is as if you mark a point on the stomach according to the quantity that you wish with ink; then cauterize it with the point cautery; then treat it with the treatment which preceded until it is healed.

Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	When pain occurs in the liver from cold and moisture, or from thick wind, until it departs from its natural complexion by the exit of superfluities, and the patient is treated with what we have said, and it does not benefit him: then it is necessary that the patient be placed supine on his neck, and mark three cauteries with ink according to this figure, and this same quantity on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches; and let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger; and let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body; and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	And let the quantity of that which is burned be, in thickness of the skin, the quantity of half of it not added; and let the patient be standing on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	If however he is not standing, then let him be lying, having already extended his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	This is the form of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	And it is possible for you, indeed, to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when there is subtlety and prudence in your skill.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	And beware lest you proceed to the utmost in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, wherefore the whole body is burned and it reaches the intestines; for the skin there is delicate, so know that.

Caput XXX.	Chapter XXX.
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When an exit occurs, and you wish to know whether the abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its membrane: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient is afflicted with pain, and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the membrane of the liver, there is intense sharpness with the pain; and you see already that the treatment has wearied his physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, the patient should lie on their back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then, mark the location of the abscess with ink; then apply a cautery that resembles a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned, and it reaches the siphac, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for exits until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not fitting that one use this type of cautery, unless one whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have come together with experience many times; then only should one dare on such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But truly, to leave it alone is better, in my opinion.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that cautery with aristolochia roots is for cold pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you should take from dry, long aristolochia roots, one root longer than the others, which is found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil and light it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in the area between the fork-like junction with the neck and with two small cauteries slightly slanted downward on the area under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slanted slightly backward; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from behind: one on that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulder blades.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And you should not press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be on the skin in plain view, smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod: and they ignite it, and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach the abscess with it, and pus emerges: as we have said regarding the abscess of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this perforation with the cautery there is fear that either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, with no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you treat the illness of the spleen, with what we have said concerning the treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery is to be applied in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of these is to make three cauteries, or four, drawing them along the length of the spleen according to the pattern of the liver cauteries, whose figure preceded.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cautery a distance of the width of a finger, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of the cautery be as we described for the cautery of the liver, equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the infirm person lie supine on their back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another method of cauterization is this: that you heat a cautery having two prongs, as we described in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus, and raise the skin, which is in a direct line with the spleen, where the left arm of the sick person reaches.  And let your raising of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert the two very hot prongs until with them you penetrate the skin on the other side, then withdraw the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then treat the cautery after you have let it emit pus for many days, for it is more beneficial than all the other preceding treatments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cautery does not fall upon dropsy unless properly applied.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around the navel, and one cautery above the stomach, and another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then leave the cautery open, so that it may discharge pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery with him: for it is necessary that two intentions be gathered in him, and healing will hasten to him with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be nail-shaped, according to its previously stated form; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, according to its previously stated form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-four.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses occur in a hydrops patient, and they are filled with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot, in the space between the auricular and annular bones, and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then raise your hand, and do not repeat it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water will sweat out, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the knife-like extremity of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately in the middle of the leg; and make two cauteries above each thigh; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water will sweat out from it; then treat it with the other things we have mentioned.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in abdominal distension.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the distension of the belly is from cold and dampness, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers which are in the stomach and intestines; and it is treated with the methods of treatment, and is not healed; and you see the sick person tolerating a cautery of exuberant power, then cauterize him with a large cautery above his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery, and four fine cauteries in the circumference of the navel, with a fine clavi-shaped cautery; and a large cautery above the hypochondrium, or two cauteries.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see the dampness excessive, and the sick person tolerating it, then cauterize him with a cautery above the breastbone, and with a cautery above each flank; and perhaps you will add two small cauteries to the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For it is a beneficial treatment, whose aid does not err.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from thick, cold humors, or corrupted dampness, and are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries above the lower spine of the back a little below the navel triangularly, and with a cautery below the navel as if with two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face become ulcerated, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, as previously described; and cauterize him on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a key-shaped cautery; and leave the cautery open for a time; then treat him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise althelul, then heat a cautery that resembles a ray.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert it, heated, into the excised althelul; and with the last part of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which blood flows: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with the cautery according to what we have recounted.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with that which benefits them from ointments, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cautery upon the alcatin, it is more effective in helping.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter Thirty-eight.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the incision and work that we have described in its place, and is frightened by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula occurs to someone, and becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humours.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore it is more fitting that you should probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then ascertain its depth with the probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then heat the cautery, which is similar to a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then introduce the heated cautery into the fistula itself, and note the amount by which it has penetrated.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to it, until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to your necessary amount.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula leads to the bladder, or to the intestine, then guard yourself from these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you judge that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then treat the place until it is healed.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	If however the place is sealed, and the matter is cut away from it, and remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if matter is not cut away from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupted bone is deep within it, or something like that from those things: whose discussion will come in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter Thirty-Nine.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from thick wind, and the strength of the sufferer is diminished by it, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the almethen over the kidneys, cauterizing over each kidney with a cautery iron, the description of which has preceded.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the almeidatu itself.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Therefore three lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore the last will be more helpful.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and dampness, to the point that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the summit above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic bone begin.  Cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the summit, and another from the left: and let the length of this cauterization on each side be according to the width of a thumb's breadth. And cauterize with a lower dorsal cautery, or with two cauteries if that is necessary: and let it be as described previously (or according to what preceded) for the cautery's grip.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and dampness affect the uterus, hindering conception, corrupting her menses, delaying their expulsion, and causing pain upon their arrival, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we described in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above on the lower back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery's grip be as before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	Concerning the method of cauterizing the rectum in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When mucous humors are discharged into the rectum, and cause its exit from its proper place; and a sign of this is that one leg is extended over the other when they are compared, and the location of the dislocation is found empty there.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the affected area over the rectum itself with a similar circular cautery; after marking the circumference of the rectum with ink, as it revolves; and the rectum itself should fall in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cautery be of the form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive-shaped cautery; and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the hip socket, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and it becomes chronic: then it is necessary to free the patient from the thick humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	Cauterization with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is to cauterize above the hip socket itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good, or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let the space that is between each cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes however a cautery is made in the middle above the hip itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cautery in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip itself, and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	However, if it extends to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries upon the thigh, upon the place to which the sick person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery upon the calf four fingers towards the wild side for a short time: and let the cautery be a knife-cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the sick person indicates that the pain extends up to near the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a point cautery, three, or four, or more, if it needs them.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with one knife cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not finally use the cautery in such a way that you burn a nerve or a large artery, and thereby draw upon the sick person an evil harm or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And indeed I have already seen one and another, of those who have cauterized above the ankle and have been too thorough in the cauterization, and the leg has swollen until the swelling reached the foot, and the entire foot has been perforated and corrupted; then a dissolution of the belly followed, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts at the same time, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And certain wise men said in the cauterization of the buttock, this is the method of the cautery.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter is half a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date stone, or a little less: and within that cautery let there be a third cautery.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let the space that is between each cautery be the size of a thumb's knot; and let the cauteries be open on both sides; and let their height be like one knot, or two knots; and make a handle for them of iron, fitting well into the cauteries.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in fire, until it glows red and throws off sparks; then let it be placed over the buttock of the sick person lying on their healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, plaster with butter; and leave the wound open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat him with ointment, until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "By this sort of cautery, my sons, we have used little, because of the fear of its appearance; and because we found few who would wait upon it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, it is a good cautery for the one who suffers, and finds its place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	A cautery, however, is with burning medicines, so that you make two samia having a pierced armlet, into which descends the hinge of its door, of bronze or iron, the length of a wall: on whose height there are two knots, or like them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let the space that is between each be the width of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that contain each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying on his healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand upon the box of ashes strongly.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been heated with fire for a short time, and hold it for a quantity of an hour: and let the sick person tolerate its burning and its cauterization, for he finds burning as if it were fire, until the burning subsides.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wash away the hot water from the whole ash with fresh water: then leave it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place butter upon it until the blackness of the cauterization is removed: and leave it for several days, and pus will run from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For it is the final remedy.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, just as you did for the ash equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method for hot water; and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and quicklime, each one part; grind both, and put them in a new pot whose lower part has a small hole, according to the quantity that the radius will enter; and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot; and pour over the alkali and lime sweet water, which submerges both by a finger; after you have compressed them with your hand with good compression; and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then collect all that water and pour it over other lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For then it will be very strong and sharp, which is used in many surgical operations and in cauterizing other limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it produces the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And among the medicines with which the anca is cauterized, are also like tesisie, and honey of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen, indeed, narrating, recounted the cure of a certain man from the ancients, with which the pain of the anca and the sciatic vein were cured; and he magnified it to be very great.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that he did not need any other treatment, and that he was healed in one instance, until he recounted that perhaps he entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from green seitaragi; and if green is not found, let dry, fresh material be taken; and let it be rubbed much with some fat, and placed upon the anca, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh; and let it be bound, and let it be left for the amount of three hours, or for the amount that the sick person feels the sedation of the burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then put him into a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes moist, put him on a couch.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that it is not necessary for anyone to use a cautery with these remedies, unless after the evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides, indeed, said that the dung of goats, when a sciatic vein is cauterized with it, helps it: and the cautery is done in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place, which is between the big toe and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take dry goat dung, and inflame it in fire, until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it upon the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat it.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Therefore do not cease to do this, until sensation reaches the middle up to the ankle, and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the Vaccine cautery.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain in the back occurs due to many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or an evacuation of excess fluids, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and damp matter: and indeed the cautery does not apply except in this single instance, which occurs from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills and similar remedies, three lines should be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the afflicted area itself.  After marking each line with five cauteries, or more depending on the patient's tolerance and the severity of the case, apply the cauterization using a cautery-pointed instrument.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries, using a cautery with a medial point, following this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	Concerning the method of cauterization in the early stages of a hump.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This illness often occurs in young infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is that there is a constriction in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you will find at the end of the thoracic spine and its joints that it has already begun to project beyond the other vertebrae.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cautery cover the entire part of the vertebra equally; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines; and let the points be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, that you do not apply the cautery to the hump that arises from nerve spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	Concerning the method of cauterization in gout and joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains in the joints are from cold humours which flow to any part of the body, then when such pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to properly name it gout.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of treatment, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is to cauterize it, after evacuation, around the joint of the feet, with many cauteries: and let the cautery be oily.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose this is the form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you need to puncture the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries, from every side, with this same cautery, the Claviform.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If, however, more cauteries are necessary for you, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we said about cautery in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture in the circumference of the joints, like two lines revolving.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, over every knot a puncture, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not remove the sick person from good regimen, from the taking of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, and the intestine, or the spermatic cord, descends toward the testicle, and it is in its early stages and close: then it is necessary to order the sick person to abandon his eating on his particular day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives, so that the stool descends from his belly.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands upon his back; and order him to hold his breath until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture above the pubic bone, with a mark whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then cauterize with an iron cautery, of which this is the shape, until it turns white and throws off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand over the area so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the patient's legs, and placed a cushion beneath him, and another servant on his thighs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on the mark itself, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or repeat with it another time, if you have not reached the mouth with it in the first instance.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And prudently observe for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and death or great harm befall the patient through it.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is not effective.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And the cautery for infants should be fine, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat with the other ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you place nourishment for the duration of his healing, which will soothe his stomach, so that the intestines do not expel during straining and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him be lessened in labor, and in filling of food and drink, and in loud voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, he is thus healed with complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak of the treatment of Ruptures with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	However, when Ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are beginning, and force so that they are not added to, then cauterize the Rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and let that which is burned be from then as its third part.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then treat him with what we have said: and it will not be added to.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And already some first ones have said that a Rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery, according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across in the upper side of the Rupture, and another line to the lower.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery iron.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When in certain limbs pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery iron.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery of every limb be according to its size, and its smallness, and its weakness, and its strength, and the location of the twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cautery, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then repeat the cautery on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because it is customary for these pains to shift from one limb to that which is near it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to follow them with cautery until the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in Leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Leprosy patients are sometimes greatly helped by cautery.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	Therefore, if the leprosy is extensive, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it neither recedes nor stops; and you fear that the corruption may encompass the entirety of his constitution; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the noted head, and a second below it towards the forehead near the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And hold your hand with the cautery for a short while, until it imprints a small impression on the bone, and the tissues are loosened from it: so that the expiration of gross vapors from it may be relieved; and cauterize also with the cautery upon the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	However, if the leprosy has already spread over the patient, and is clearly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with those cauteries that we have mentioned on the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jawbones, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and one large one on the haunches near the end of the tail and one above it, in the very flesh of the buttocks; and two on the armpits: namely, one on each armpit, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the soft parts of his chest; and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers and his toes; and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are upon the heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes a cautery is applied to the breastbone, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you apply the cautery, the more beneficial and helpful it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not find pain in the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And there should be cauteries of different sizes, according to the limbs and joints, just as was stated previously in the kinds of instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the cautery with herb flour and honey, and with other treatments, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	Concerning the method of cauterization in numbness.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the deserved size of the limb, or its smallness.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery enter the thickness of the skin a little.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes a cautery is applied to something of numbness that happens to the hand and foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exits of the nerves that move that limb; and the numbness is removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But let no one presume upon it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exit of the nerves moving the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras is old, and nothing from the skills of medicine helps it, then cauterize over it itself with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until its whiteness is removed and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and arnogloss leaves, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: of each one part; mix all these together, and apply them on a cloth, and let them adhere to the place, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	However, it does not seem right to me, because I fear that it will ulcerate; and I have already seen this happen several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we have said; or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or due to the infirm's age, when he is decrepit with little blood, or due to the time, and the force to hasten the maturation of Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then leave it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the infirm, so that the course of pus may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	Concerning the method of cauterizing a corrosive evil.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corrosive is nothing but corruption walking in a member, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate a cautery with fire, then use many cauteries of fire, small and large, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosive is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then leave it for three days, and put ground sulphur with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born in a way where there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And it is sometimes cured by corrosive medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it itself arises in place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cautery with fire is of quicker help; and I have already said that its cauterization with corrosive medicine is in division: so take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in warts, and corns.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This ailment often occurs in the lower parts of the feet: and it is a thick, filtered substance that hurts the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And cautery in them is indeed according to two methods: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	As for cautery with fire, you should make a concave cautery, similar to a hawk's wing, made of iron, in a size that completely contains the wart on all sides, and with thin edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it, heated, over the wart.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then revolve the hand with the cautery in a circular motion around the wart, until the cautery reaches the depth of the wart, and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows and salt, and leave the plaster over it overnight.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with a generative flesh ointment, until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with warm water.  And take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's wing, and place it on the wart, or corn.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula, hold your hand, and rotate it with the pressure of your hand for a short time, so that the edge of the cannula presses on the root of the wart, and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the wart; and the sick person should wait for a while on the mordication of the hot water for an hour.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then leave it, for the wart is eradicated with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do this with each of them one by one, until you have treated all those that are on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which produces flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	Concerning the method of cauterization in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When tremor occurs in someone due to cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, over the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For tremor subsides with the cautery of olives, and the health of the cold ailment speeds.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul Albathir are expelled in the body, that is, pustules, which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it is necessary, first, when they appear, that all pustules on every head be cauterized with a fine cautery of myrtlewood, whose tip has been ignited with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they are not increased; and the superfluity which makes them is broken, and they are healed from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Concerning the method of cauterization in a blood flow from an artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Often a flow of blood occurs from an artery that has been cut in a wound that occurs externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and things similar to them: and it is difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly, until the blood is contained under your finger and no more comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place small, olive-shaped cauteries, and many large ones, in the fire: and blow over them, until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on the vein itself, after you quickly remove your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is driven out when you lift your finger from the opening of the artery, and extinguish the cautery, then quickly take another cautery from the cauteries that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore, do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and cause another harm to the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is then not possible to cut it off, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it should be tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines of a nature to cut off the blood should be placed on it, and it should be bound with a fitting constriction of a pillow.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, he who performs its excision with a ligature and constriction with a cloth, or with the application of burning things and similar methods, does not truly benefit it, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If, however, this should happen to someone, and a physician, nor medicine, be present for him, then let him begin with the placement of the index finger on the opening of the vein itself, as we have described, and with its strong constriction, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, above it with very cold water, continually, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs in terms of cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already stated in the first chapter that every illness in which cautery with fire and burning medicine is appropriate, and the occasions for it, its causes, its instruments, and the forms of cauteries.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall proceed in this chapter along the same path, so that the seeker may have his question relieved.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary that you, my children, learn that in this chapter is the terror that is in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And therefore it is necessary that there be more caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, evacuation with blood frequently occurs, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or the incision over an abscess, or the opening of an exit, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which trepidation and fear are associated, and death falls in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, lest that which causes hesitation befall you, for sometimes in this art the ways of men clash with the ways of illnesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him; because of the intensity he finds in his illness and the length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is he who gives his lyre, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let your caution be stronger than your greed and your rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies to you that to which praiseworthy succession has arrived.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use in the treatment of all your sick, prognostication and indication of that to which health may suitably come.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in that is help for you in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, children, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I, indeed, have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter on the cautery, from the neck up to the feet: so that your inquiry, which you desire from it, and of which you have need, may be alleviated.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Concerning the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this ailment frequently occurs to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause that is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this illness in others than in children, and death has hastened to all whom I have seen afflicted by it.  Therefore, it seemed good to me to omit treatment in this case.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I saw one of them, a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day until it could no longer sit upon itself, because of the size of its head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the sinus.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And if, in that case, the moisture is between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single fissure in the middle of the head, with a width: and the fissure's length should be about two spans, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the form of a lancet.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If, therefore, the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place two fissures, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open from every side, and water is pressed out when you press it with your hand inwards, and that is not hidden from you: then it is necessary to make three fissures in the middle of the head, according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the fissures with cloths and bandages.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply a poultice of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with sutures and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not allow the head to be bound with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person all dry foods with little moisture, until the limb strengthens and heals.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	Because sometimes there is more in the occiput, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, proceed with the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person die from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Concerning the incision of arteries behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When discharges occur to someone in the eyes or chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the ultimate treatment in that case is the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the sick person shave their head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tighten their neck with any cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein beats.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with ink each of the two [spots]: and cut each with a lancet on both sides, the incision reaching the bone, and let it be made across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut it upward with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating discharge, which leaps inward with a frequent bound.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If however the artery is not visible to the sense, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with ink, and cut to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which must be emitted of blood is six ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of that according to the amount which appears to you from the weakness of the sick person and the filling of his artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if anything remains on the bone from the sifac, then cut it, so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man experiences chronic hemicrania, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors and heat in the temporal muscles, or severe chronic pain, and similar afflictions: and if treatment with the methods of medicine does not help: then we are experienced in these illnesses with the extraction of arteries from the temples, or their cauterization, as we have described.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operating on their extraction is that the infirm person should shave the hairs that are on the temples, and direct himself toward the artery appearing in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For it indeed shows itself to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by intense cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then the infirm person should tie their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the area with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or apply steam to the area with warm water, until a clear appearance is evident to you.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the spatula which I have just formed.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards until you have pulled it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tunics that are under it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its ends will be lengthened and drawn together, and so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong, double thread, of silk or of strong cords, so that putrefaction does not quickly occur before the wound is consolidated, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut away the excess that is between the two ligatures.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that hour, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery up to the bone, with a surgical cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will remain in place of the same work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is a better operation, unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because cautery is among those things that help to end humidities.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore, it is a better aid.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old linen, and pads properly made should be placed upon it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the removal, treat it with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If meanwhile, during the operation, a flow of blood occurs from an artery, then hurry to cut it with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi; and bind your hand, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If none of those are present for you, then place your finger on the place, until the blood is congealed.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And embrocate the place with water of great coldness, until the sharpness subsides, and it is bound according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to extract than an artery, is, that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two knives; and let the sharpness of the two knives be similar to an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are of much less sharpness than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Because if they are sharp, like two knives, cold comes quickly to both: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is retained in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let the space between the two knives be the thickness of a finger, after you mark two places with ink; and place both very hot until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that that which is between its extremities may be extended.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not consolidate completely with this cautery.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Concerning the treatment of acute and persistent running of tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins that are on the outer surface of the head, and no medical treatment with medicines helps them, and you see the patient's face already red, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are weakened, damp, so that their hairs are already corroded with the corrosion, and his eyelids are inflamed from the intensity of the tears; then the ancients used this operation in their treatment, and they named this treatment with the Knife.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is necessary to instruct the patient to shave the hair on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three equally spaced incisions on the forehead, following the length of the forehead.  The length of each incision should be about two fingers.  One incision should be equidistant with the length of the nose, in the middle of the forehead; the second, slightly off the temples; and the third, on the opposite side.  Be careful not to cut the arteries which are on either side. Keep your hand away from the area where the two jawbones meet. The distance between each incision should be the equivalent of three fingers placed together.  Prepare a piece of sponge, or many dry cloths, to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form is as follows.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision, and scrape away all the skin that is between the two incisions, with the spatula, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then withdraw this spatula, and introduce into the first incision another instrument, called a sharp scalpel, with one smooth side, not sharp, on the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with skin, and its smooth side towards the bone; and push it, until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut with it all the vessels, which descend from the head to the eyes; except that the incision continues to that which appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do that in the middle fissure until another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after an equal quantity of blood flows out, express the places from the fragments of clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place in every fissure a linen cloth from old cotton, and place over them cushions soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day, loosen the bandage, and administer a plentiful infusion with lukewarm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with basil ointment, and the other remedies with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	Concerning the treatment of acute tears and catarrhs to the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When acute, sharp, persistent catarrhs occur in someone; and you see their eyes weakened, small, and their gaze already weakened; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and a sharp, painful headache deep within the head, followed by sneezing; then, understand from these occurrences that these materials, and catarrhs, do not arise unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is to order the sick person to shave their forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make one incision in the middle of the forehead, or a little wider elsewhere, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and draw your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during chewing, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two edges of the incision with old linen or linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, lest a hot abscess occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you remove it, and see that the hot abscess is already lessening, then you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow; such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and apply it to the growth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something like a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as chickpeas and beans; or it is a fluid substance, such as water, vinegar, and similar things; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone from those which are not added nor grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, then instill into the ear something of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make the person sneeze with condiments, and occlude the nostrils at the arrival of the sneeze, after you have placed around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and extend the ear upwards.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For often it comes out with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not come out, then administer its extraction with forceps, that is, with fine tweezers: the form of which is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If therefore it comes out with the forceps, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine, single-pronged hook.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If therefore it does not come out through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear cavity deeply, and plug what is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no passage by wind except through the tube: then extract with your wind by a strong suction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For many times it comes out with what we have recounted.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If however it does not come out in this way, then take a small amount of birdlime, or of glue, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, and place it at the end of a stick after you have wrapped a bandage around it properly; then insert it into the ear cavity with ease, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If therefore it does not come out with all that we have recounted, then hasten to incision, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, that you should first open a vein in the cephalic (vein), and draw out some blood according to his strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the patient sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, at its fat, in a depressed area of it; and let the incision be crescent-shaped, until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then stitch the incision as quickly as you can, and treat it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the thing falling into the ear is one of the small grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it does not yield to you, then take a thin, slender spatula, of this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And use it to remove that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do so when you think that grain has already been moistened by ear vapor, until you have broken it into many small pieces. Then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we have said, for its removal is thus eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	However, for water that enters the ear, the patient should use sneezing, at first, with a compress; and now he has filled his ear with some old lint; and lies on the ear in which is the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If therefore it emerges through it, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not, then take many stones, the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the opening of his ear; and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, let him not cease to do that with stone and stone until all the water emerges.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water emerges in such a way, that you take one from papyrus, or from reeds, and insert one end of it into the ear; and you set fire to the other end with fire, until the greatest part of it is burned.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then again another reed, and do that many times, until all the water emerges; and extract it with a cannula according to what has been stated about the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of an animal entering it, if it is of small body, like a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is of large body, which appears to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we have said in the division, and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help, then you should look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps, or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If, however, nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this, narrow below, wide above; and introduce the slender end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person tolerates; then suck with it with strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do that many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If, however, they do not obey you to exit, then smear the surrounding area of the cannula with wax, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms; and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your pouring, with which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed below, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Let the impelling thing, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze properly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a reed, and wrap a cloth around its end with a suitable wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from these into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then introduce the reed with the cloth from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is propelled into the concavity of the hearing, and the sick person feels it internally; and that which is poured into the ear, let it be warmed with fire for a short time; and beware that the thing which is distilled into it is not very cold, for the medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	Concerning the treatment of accidental stoppage of the ear.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it happens also to some people that the ear passage is obstructed by a wound, or by flesh growing in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this obstruction sometimes occurs deep within the ear cavity, and the sight does not reach it; and sometimes it occurs near the outer part of the cavity, and sight reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which the sight does not encompass, is in many instances difficult to cure.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which is visible, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look at it.  Then if you see the obstruction appearing, open it with a thin spatula, whose form is as follows: its tip has a small width, part of which is pointed; and the rest of the spatula has two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the obstruction is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a thin hook and cut it away with a forceful ease until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then introduce it into the ear canal.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you sense an obstruction, as the patient finds with a difficult hearing, attempt to open it with ease, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear a pessary according to the size of the opening, wrapped in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take a pessary, and steep it in rose water, and sprinkle ground zegi powder on it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the ear has already become abscessed, then it is necessary to remove the pessary, and apply another pessary wrapped in a cloth made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides.  Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If, however, a blood flow occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and place it over the ear. And use the remaining treatment, which cuts off the blood flow, as previously described in the treatise on distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the Altheli of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Altheli that occur in the eyelids of the eye are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore, it is necessary to grasp them with tweezers, or with a hook, and cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place ground zegi upon the affected areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For they often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	Concerning the treatment of eyelid granulations.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often something occurs in the eyelids that is similar to granulations in its strength and hardness, and on account of that it is called granulations: and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation on them is, that you consider then, if it is granulation proceeding from that which appears on the eyelid, and they move to every part, and its removal is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, make a fissure over it across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from every side with ease, until it disappears.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a hook, and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, its excision is not prepared for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with an incision for a short while, then that harms the sick person in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the fissure is large, then bring it together with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For ointment restores it and causes it to flesh over.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the granulation is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid and suspend the granulation with a hook; moreover, you need an incision and press it from every side.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is extended by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the incision of the granulation with salt water, and treat the place with that which causes fleshing, until the sick person is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	Concerning the treatment of the affliction of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fat that is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and it most often happens to children. It weighs down their eyes, and they have catarrhs in the mornings, and cannot look at the sunlight, because tears rush to them, and because of this you see them lying on their faces always, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under their eyebrows, which are already covered by swelling.  And the prominence of the Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its treatment is that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth, and prepare on it strips, and make a circle from that strip according to the amount that Axirnath contains on all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it over it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is collected in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture, with a lancet, slits along the width, and do not let the slit be larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary that you cut through the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath, for in many arrangements the Axirnath proceeds from the slit in the form of a white fat piece.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have folded between your fingers to the outside, and you turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware, do not increase the slit, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet and wound it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If however the Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the slit, you shall add a little to the slit with ease, until the Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are men who rub salt, and place it in the concavity of the slit, so that it liquefies what remains of that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	If however it happens in a place with a hot abscess, then treat it with soothing plasters, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	Concerning the ways of Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, whence it comes to be wrinkled as it should not be.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When additional hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural hair course, and they become aged: then they harm the eye, and cause various ailments, such as constant tears, and softening of the eyelids, and cloudiness, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And Ataxmir of the eye is indeed treated according to four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cautery with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with a sharp medicine, according to what has been stated in the chapter on cautery.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or Ataxmir is treated by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by tubes, according to what I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If therefore it turns, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into it, in which is the thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle with thread penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow; and pull the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it with the radius.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula proceeding from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton, or cloth; then mark on the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it is necessary that the shape be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, because it is already diversified in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For among them is one who needs a large amount to be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount that softens from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with a spatula, find above the two lines that you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the fissure be close to the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape the whole of it.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together the two lips with a suture, with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make the excess thread adhere to the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then leave the suture and threads for up to three or four days; afterwards, care for it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and care for it with that which dries and constricts it.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sealing and bringing together of the wound: but it will be better.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of treatment the ancients taught Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is care for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that you mark on the eyelid a shape, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, as we have narrated.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or aggregated, according to this form which follows, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with equality in the incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not equal to it: then take a needle in which there is a thread, and introduce it into the middle of the shape; and introduce another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand with equal elevation, and raise the skin upon which the mark is, as we have narrated.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture, and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If, however, an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with a cauterizing agent, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelid, too, that its hairs are turned.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, it is necessary that you use what we said concerning the incision: but a suture is more artificial for both.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is, that you turn the eyelid, and slit the fissure that is within, according to what I have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then skillfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood, whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of the spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then carefully place each of them over that which is left over from the eyelid, and tightly bind the two reeds from both sides with a strong constriction, and leave it for several days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the tight skin will die, and turn black, and putrefy, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two canes, which you will make according to this figure, and quantity in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The procedure in that is to take a fine needle, and insert into it a fine, smooth silk thread.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then tie its ends, and make a very small knot on each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then place in the Alinxotati another fine thread beneath it in brief, and tie its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then let the sick person place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that the operation may be revealed; because it is a subtle, or minute, operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you pull it out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati, and insert that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then pull your hand with it, until the hair emerges with the alinxotati from the eyelid with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	However, if the alinxotati is pulled out, and the hair does not emerge with it: pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread which you have placed in it, until the alinxotati emerges from the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of the eye: then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread; and remove both, and close the eye; and leave it closed for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and raise it with it; or leave it, until it lengthens after a period, and then raise it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, the accidental kind results from the healing of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to them.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of treatment in it is that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen pad, and bind it, until it is healed.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use in its treatment things that dry and constrict; for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocate with water in which cooked althea, flaxseed; and with the unguent dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil; and wrap with it a linen pad, and treat it with that.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your treatment is to strive with all your ingenuity that it not consolidate according to the form that it initially had.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation, which we have mentioned, is nothing but a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was completely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatrati which occurs in the lower part, is the one truly called Alxatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental form results from a wound, or a fissure, or a cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation in it is that you should take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and dip it into the flesh, and cause it to penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches the two ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take a radius, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and form an angle from them: until when they come together they make their shape this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its sharp lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts: sew it with a wool thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we said, of softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an injury occurs from a fissure, or suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, also according to what preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the summary of the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is on the top or below, is that the operation should proceed according to the form of the Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For it is indeed of many varieties in form: and the skilled craftsman prepares his skill in whatever way is possible for him, until he restores the figure to its natural form, or near to it, and the injured person himself, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many arrangements.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this consolidation happens to many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should insert the tip of the probe under the eyelid and lift it upwards; or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp, but rather slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and the spatula is removed, and does not injure the eye with its sharpness. And your incision should be such that you gently scrape away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the entire adhesion is healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distill into it from a sieve made of dissolved zinc with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with linen thread; and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use the sieve, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the toenail and the prominence of the tear-producing flesh.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that the toenail is according to two methods.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sifac.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen white moisture: which when it touches iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is severed, and the hook does not become fixed in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both types do not begin, unless from the greater tear duct, until it goes gradually, until it covers the sight, and hinders the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on it is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and elevate the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then collect the nail with a hook of few doublings, and extend it upward.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hairs of a horse, or ox, or cow: and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upward: and scrape with the hair the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair until its end.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that an incessant flow of tears does not result from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, of which this is the shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful, lest the spatula touch the horny coat, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then, after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a substance made from ziniar, and leave it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fixed in it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicaments, and is healed as I have described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a thin, gentle, weakly-sharpened spatula, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the nail from above with care.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming thin and breaking, and the scraping is affecting it, then distil from your hour into the eye a sieve made of ziniar, or a red sieve, or crushed salt; and bandage the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with scraping, until it is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, if the fleshy prominence of the tear duct is harmful to the eye with great injury, it should be suspended with a hook, and a portion of it should be cut; and do not make the incision too deep, so that the flow of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then instill into the tear duct a red, or one made from ziniari, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and the flesh grown in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses against the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outwards; and it resembles a rose-hip.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the treatment for it is also that the sick person should place their head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and collect all that flesh with suitable hooks: and hold it with one forceps, or tongs.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut into the flesh at first, until the whole of it is finished with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And be careful of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a spatula, which we have described in the incision of the hoof; or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, according to how its shape will appear after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When, therefore, your incision is complete, and the whole of the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar corrosive medicines: and place over the eye externally a cloth with the white of an egg: so that it is safeguarded from a hot abscess.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If any alguardenici remains, and hot blood dominates you, and you fear a hot abscess: then leave the eye, and treat it with that which calms the abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it, until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the added flesh which happens in the eye of this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye by natural or accidental means, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Concerning the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red veins that weave over the eye, and hinder the operation of its vision: and weaken the eye with the length of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, you must first consider if the eye in which the Sebel is present is strong, and there is no other ailment in it beyond the Sebel: then collect the Sebel from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place their head in your bosom.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with one hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be a thin double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graduated in one body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then collect those veins with fine scissors carefully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and are dissolved: and beware that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the scissors.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation: so that you do not injure anything but those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have finished, then instill into the eye green or red juice, that by its sharpness it may corrode what remains of the scab.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then plaster the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days, until its pain subsides; and ensure it is free from a hot abscess; then again treat it in the same way, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the scissors.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Concerning the reduction of a nose injury.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	Physicians call a nose injury a fistula, which you treat with a cautery, or with a sharply burning medicine, according to what its previous description has indicated.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it, unless you open up the abscess at its origin and remove all the moisture and pus in it until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness on it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose shape is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called a "rough head".
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Make it from tempered iron, and let its head be round like a small pestle, pointed with a file, or with a fine-pointed awl, and place it on the diseased part of the bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then revolve it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	Therefore, if the place is consolidated, and flesh grows on it, and the course of pus is cut off; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not become a boil, and no accident occurs in it; then know that it is now healed.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then it has no cure, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you uncover the second bone with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is uncovered, then take a drill according to this form, let its iron tip be triangular, and its wood be a tapering pyramid down to the tip, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the bone itself, and let it be near the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the patient feels it: by this that he finds wind exiting from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter that was being discharged outwardly returns to the nose; thus it is easier for the patient.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	Concerning the reduction of the prominent eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in vision, then it is necessary to free the patient; then bleed him; afterward apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye from above with many small pads over a plaster.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the manner of the small pads is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be folded over four times; make many of them; then place them one over another, according to the quantity required by the eye; then bind them with a firm bandage over them.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again apply cupping glasses with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the cupping glasses, and leave the eye bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be bound tightly; then remove the bandage after one day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the condition of its tunic, it is good; and if not, then apply the plaster again, and pads, and bandage, and cupping glasses, until it is healed.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	Concerning the incision of the uvea tunic.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When rupture occurs in the uvea tunic, then it protrudes and emerges outside the eyelids like a uvea grain, and disfigures the human form because of it, and the desire is to incise it: then the operation in it is as I narrate: and it is, that you insert a needle into the root of the uvea from the inferior to the superior part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle carrying a double thread from the lacrimal side, and make it penetrate; and leave the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the uvea in a circle around the needle; and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the needle, and place upon the eye wool steeped in the white of an egg; and leave it, until the thread falls with the uvea.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the uvea is tightened from every side with a circle of cloth, until the eye adds great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a fine spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white fluid runs out, and the eye descends, and enters immediately; then tighten it until it is healed.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This illness, called Alcomnati, is nothing but pus that collects in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not the eye itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operation in it is that you make the infirm person sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take its head in your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to your eyes below.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and let the light be freed: and let the sick person see things as they saw: and if it does not descend lower, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the sick person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine spatula, and split with it above the corneal membrane slightly at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, in the fold, until pus emerges.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it emerges, then instill warm water in which you have mixed honey into the eye: or water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey: then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Concerning the treatment of water that descends into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already discussed the types of water in the division, and what is suitable for piercing, the speaker declaring and explaining.  Then take that same thing according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary to make the sick person sit between your hands, square, facing away from the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye tightly; then with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye, or with your left hand, if it is the right eye, press the eyelid of his eye.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is the left eye, or with your left hand, if the eye is the right eye.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the almagda near the crown, along the thickness of a ray, on the apparent white of the eye near the smaller tear duct; then propel the almagda with force, and you revolve your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you feel that the almagda has now reached the empty thing.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth be the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the almagda to the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it downwards one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that above which he opens his vision immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore the water descends, then put it down a second time, apart from the almagda exiting.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend: then extract the almagda with ease: and you revolve your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in water some of the clear gem salt: and wash the eye with it from the inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place over the eye all the linen, or wool soaked in rose oil, and egg white; and bind the healthy eye with it.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	We, and those of our time, place on it pounded cumin with egg white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from people whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, gently scrape with it only the conjunctiva, and do not place your hand in the opening: and it is only to make a subtle path to the almagda's location.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagda, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare a suitable sleeping area for the sick person, where they sleep on their back in a dark room: and forbid all movements and coughing: and place their food such that it soothes their nature: and they must not move their head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage remain in accordance with its arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then remove it in that dark room, and test his vision: and make him see objects.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then replace the bandage until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not appropriate to do that at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, it is necessary to delay it, because water ascends quickly through violent looking.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary to remove the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with whatever quiets the abscess, until it subsides; then clear his vision, and apply an oral remedy to his face to regulate his vision under it for some days, while he remains in that dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him gradually emerge from the house, and move about in his own rooms.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in a zaltée, a student is not excused from sight at times; then let him dare to undertake the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And now indeed someone from those who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, from which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand upon it.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with this same fineness, and pointed.
Formae magda.	Forms of the magdan.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Concerning the treatment of flesh grown in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes various fleshy growths arise in the nose, among which is something resembling a scorpion with many feet; and from it is cancerous flesh, stony, of a dark color; and from it is flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that therefore which is soft of these fleshy growths, not deceitful nor cancerous, it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into those growths; then pull them outward, and cut what you have grasped from them with a fine, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains from that whose removal is not possible, then scrape it away with one of the fine instruments with ease, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates it, or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is separated, and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then vinegar, and water, or wine, should be applied to the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose opens, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Therefore, it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger's width, or less; and let the infirm person, as much as possible, direct one end of the thread into the nose with a rod, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it like a needle; and pull his odoriferous thing until it reaches the abscess, and emerges above his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times children like Attomi do a similar thing in schools; and it is an easy thing for him who wishes.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then, and with instruments, cut away the flesh with the knots which are on the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do that until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread; and place in the nose after cleansing the blood, a pledget which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment eats away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then place at the end of the matter, into the nose, a lead cannula, for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it needs a treatment that dries it, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make a nasal douche, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it from silver or bronze: it should be like a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passageway should be similar.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a tube.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the shell of the instrument for nasal irrigation should be full, revealed; which has a handle at its end, with which you hold it when you heat oil or whatever you wish from juices and fluid things in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Of the treatment of nasal warts.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Often a wart is born at the end of the nose, and it grows larger and increases with the days, until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cut it off and eradicate all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the site either a cautery or a burning medicine that stands in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If, therefore, its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider, if it is stony, hard, of dark color, and insensitive: then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For I have often seen that when a man cuts an abscess, and great harm results to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that its incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the infirmity, and cut it without fear, without apprehension, and treat the site with something that dries and constricts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little assistance is given in it by operation, except in some individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something of that sort happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then bring the edges of the wound together with suture; afterward, treat it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the edges of the separation of continuity are already separated, and each part is healthy, then you should scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then bring the two edges together with suture, and tie them, and powder upon it the blood of the dragon and crushed frankincense; and place upon the powders a piece of diafinicon plaster and some other of the consolidating plasters; and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then untie it, and change the medicine; and leave it until the threads cut themselves off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of suturing is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the belly; or bring together the separation with thread, as I have made known to you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	Concerning the extraction of lip nodes.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people often have hard abscesses, similar to the grains of herbs, in the interior of their lips; and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip, and to split over every node of it, and to suspend it with a hook, and to cut it from every side.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with crushed zegi, until the blood is stopped.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be washed with vinegar, and the place where there is astringency should be treated with it, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Concerning the incision of fleshy tissue on the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Flesh often grows on the gums, which the ancients called abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, you should suspend it with a hook; or grasp it with forceps, and cut it near its root, and allow the pus or blood to run.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on the affected area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the extraction of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes rough, foul, and sometimes darkened, yellowish, and greenish, hard crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth from the inner and outer sides, and between the gums, until the decay reaches the gums, and the teeth become unsightly because of it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore, you should have the patient sit between your hands, with his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth, where the crusts appear to you, and matter similar to sand, until nothing remains of them, and similarly do with the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things, until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If, therefore, the matter that is on them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another, second, and third day, until finally the desired result is achieved.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that a tooth requires scrapers of various shapes and forms, according to how the operation is prepared.  Therefore, the scraper used to scrape the tooth from the bottom is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to different shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And have these shapes of scrapers prepared, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	Concerning the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You ought to treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and be slow in its eradication.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For there is nothing to replace it when it is eradicated, because it is a lofty substance: until when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the infirm is forced to eradicate it, so that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be certified by you.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often pain deceives the infirm, and they think that it is in the tooth's saha, and they eradicate it: then the pain does not recede, until the infirm's tooth is eradicated.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on all sides: then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps at first slowly, until you crush it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and the patient's head between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to its straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not emerge, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth: and tie it with the end of a thin ray, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary that you act meticulously with the scarification around the gum from every side very much.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And maintain your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which is greater pain to him at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness in its eradication, beyond what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and the roots of it all remain, or some of them; or to extract it with some of the jawbones: as we have testified many times.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then rub some zegi there, and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed against the tooth; they should be like those with thick handles, so that when you tighten them, they do not yield or double: with short extremities, and made of strong iron, or well-made steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter others, and grip with a fitting, strong constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes the extremities are made like the shape of the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are of strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter Thirty-one.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When, during the extraction of a tooth, something remains, then it is necessary to apply to the spot a poultice of butter for one or two days, until the area softens; then introduce to it algasti, or forceps, whose extremities are similar to the beak of a bird called a stork.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This, however, is the form of the forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities should be made like a file from within, or like aliskilfegi.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If, therefore, it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully approach the root and expose all the flesh, and introduce an instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short in extremity, somewhat thick, and let it not be soaked, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If, therefore, the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with other instruments whose forms are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first is triangular in extremity, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also, it is helped with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools which preceded in the rationale of the teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also, let there be help with this instrument, which is likened to a large hook, of this form, triangular extremity twisted, in which there is something of thickness, so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many instruments for the teeth, and similarly, the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument, according to that which operation and the illnesses themselves signify to him.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since there are illnesses for which the ancients did not say there was an instrument, because of the diversity of their species.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If, however, a bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or rots: then probe over it in its place with that which is fitting to it from among the instruments and forceps which I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and help with a chisel, the shape of which is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of thickness in it gradually, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and does not flee and go, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however there is small rot in the bone, then scrape it from its rot, and treat it until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the sawing of teeth that protrude over others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, a foul form is made by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are for sale.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is therefore necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if a tooth has grown after another tooth, and is not in place, or if sawing or filing it is not possible, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your incision be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another of the teeth is not moved.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	If however it is prominent, exposed to its filing: then file it with a file made of tempered iron, of which the form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	Let the whole be of tempered iron, and its handle of small, pointed points, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls; then smooth it, finally scrape it with certain scrapers.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If, however, there is a tooth from which a part breaks off, and it injures the tongue: then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made equal; and it is flattened, and it does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Concerning the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the front teeth are injured and displaced by a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on it without it falling, and you have treated them with astringent remedies and the treatment was not successful: then it is appropriate for them to be bound with gold wire; for silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of medium fineness and thickness according to the amount that it needs to span between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the method of retention is to take a wire and insert twice its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the loosened teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the weaving to a healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving back to the place where you began; and tighten your hand with delicacy and skill until it is firmly held; and let your tightening of the wire be near the roots of the teeth, so it does not slip out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring both ends together and twist them together; and hide them between the healthy tooth and the loose tooth so they do not harm the tongue; then let it be so tight as to remain.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If however it loosens or breaks, tighten them with another wire and it will remain so during the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the method for teeth, and the shape of retention for two healthy teeth and two loose teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return after falling out to their places and are retained as we have described, and remain; and only a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman can achieve this.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted; and it is shaped like a tooth and placed in the socket, whereby the tooth is strengthened and tightened, as we said; and it remains and serves with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament which occurs under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation on it is that you open the sick person's mouth at his head in your presence, and lift his tongue; then cut that nervous ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its restraint.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something of hardness and knotting in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then apply a hook to it, and split it across its width, until you cut the ligament, and the knotting is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful, lest there be a fissure deep within the flesh, and you cut an artery there, and a flow of blood occur.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then wash the place of the incision with rose water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen bandage under the tongue, which the sick person should hold all night, so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If a flow of blood occurs, then place crushed zegi over the area.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the area with a lentiginous cautery, which is appropriate for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Concerning the extraction of a Ranula which occurs under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes an abscess occurs under the tongue that resembles a small frog, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it grows so large that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the treatment in this is to open the mouth of the sick person in the presence of the sun, and consider the abscess.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it to be of dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined towards whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a thin spatula, and free it from every side.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood overcomes you during your operation, then place powdered zegi upon it until the bleeding ceases; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and treat it with the appropriate remaining treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes there occur between the throat, that is, glands resembling algodad, which occur externally; and they are called the two tonsils. When you treat them with what we said in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, of a dark colour, with little sensation, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of red colour, and its root is thick, then do not touch it even with iron, fearing a flow of blood, but rather leave it until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it, or it will break open by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of white colour, round, and its root is thin, then it is necessary to cut it.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider before his operation, if the abscess has quieted, its heat having been completed by rest, or has lessened with some diminution: then therefore make the sick man sit before the sun, and let his head be in your lap: and open his mouth, and let the servant take between his hands, and press down his tongue with an instrument, of which this is the shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze, which is as thin as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take the hook, and fix it into the tonsil, and pull it outward as much as you can, besides which pull out with it something from the coverings.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument, of which this is the following shape.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It resembles shears: however, let its ends be curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a straight line with the other sharply: therefore take care that it is made of tempered iron, or steeped in alfuled.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, of which this is the form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	Let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one tonsil, cut the other according to this same type of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or the leaves of myrtle, and similar astringents, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, cut it according to what I have said about the incision of the two tonsils equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I myself have already treated a woman from an abscess that arose between her throat, which was drawing to a purple hue, few in senses, which had almost completely closed her throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her from eating and drinking water: and she had already reached death if it had remained for one or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had ascended so much that it had emitted two branches, until they emerged above the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore hastened quickly, and fixed a hook in one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn from it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to that which proceeded from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened its mouth, and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a part of it, and only a little blood ran from it: therefore the woman's throat was healed, and she immediately began to drink water, then took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times for a long time; and the abscess succeeded the place that I was cutting, until it was extended too much and with it that.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore it remained from the addition; then I went away from that place, and I did not know what God did with her afterward.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Concerning the incision of the abscess of the uvula.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and it becomes an abscess, and is long, then it is called a perpendicular one; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the hot abscess has ceased from it, and is subtle; then it is necessary that you should cut it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And that which is collected round from it, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a brown or black colour, and has no feeling, then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For there is fear upon the sick person in it.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I have described, from its whiteness and length, you must make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument of which the description preceded; then fix the hook into the uvula and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments that I have mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added beyond its natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will injure the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we described in the incision of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If, however, the patient is frightened by the incision, then it is necessary that you use ingenuity in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of the cautery on it is not, unless with sharp water, and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument that we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water that I told you about in the chapter on cauterization, and make with it quicklime, not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, of which this is the shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be like the concavity of a spoon's radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself, and let the sick person lie on their side, so that saliva flows from their mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing from it descends to their throat and harms them.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you shall apply it to the uvula for a half-hour, until you see that it is already blackened, and the biting of the medicine has settled.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a pledget, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and instill the pledget with medicine, and insert the radius with the pledget into the cannula from above, until the pledget adheres to the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do that many times, until you obtain what you want from the cauterization of the uvula.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then leave it; for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization, wipe the surrounding uvula with a pledget soaked in butter, and cleanse whatever is around it of medicine; and wash it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And treat it externally with embrocations, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This method of treatment is therefore healthier and further removed from danger.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the uvula is treated with something finer than cautery and incision: it is treated with fumigation, in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and absinthe, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and immerse them in vinegar, and boil them: and let the pot be properly plastered with clay; and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver, or bronze; and let the end, on which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor ascends to the uvula over the tube, until the uvula is darkened considerably.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's arrival.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it usually adds to the abscess; and it is not appropriate for you to do it unless at the decline of its hot abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place on its end the shell of an egg, so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the egg shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from good treatment with health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it is necessary to extract that which is apparent from them upon which the sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument near the sun, and it is declared to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make the weak vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dry sea sponge: and tie it to a thread, then let him swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it reaches the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not come out with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be thicker than a radius slightly, and at its extremity let there be a curve, which he should introduce into his throat with ease: and let him hold his head elevated upwards.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that coughing does not occur to him, and let him push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the infirm introduce it is better, because of his knowledge of the place of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the amount prepared for him, until it emerges.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Concerning the extraction of the Leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is medicated with what I have said in the division concerning treatment with medicines, and it does not help, then consider in the throat of the infirm in the presence of the sun, or in the sun after you have pressed his tongue with the instrument which I have told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with slender forceps properly.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them, then take a concave tube, and introduce it into the throat of the infirm almost to the gullet; then introduce into the concavity of the tube a heated iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times, and let the infirm abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him wash his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If however it does not come out with what we have recounted, then fumigate the infirm person with fleas, or with asa, with the instrument that I have recounted in the fumigation of the uvula.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do that many times, for it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a lid, in the middle of which is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then direct the fumigation, and let the sick person put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has now reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt and garlic, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary that it depart with this treatment.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it visibly.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature that is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its extremity is like the beak of a bird called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter XL.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Abscesses have many species, of many kinds, according to the recollection of them, namely one, and one in this book; and they are diverse in their perforation and incision according to two methods.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of which is from the species of abscess in itself, and because it encompasses humors.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is due to the locations in which it occurs in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in fleshy tissue is different from an abscess occurring in joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of abscesses, some should not be punctured unless after the maturation of the pus in them, and its completion; and of them, some should be punctured while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Like abscesses that are near the joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an abscess occurs near a joint, and its duration continues until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore, it is a more proximate cause of the contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is the abscess in a main limb: because if you delay its puncture until it matures, it will harm either the limb or through the limb the main part.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it immaturely; and it is not fitting to pierce a raw abscess, not of complete digestion, except that which is near the anus, lest it putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or become in its terminus that which is not healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the time of puncturing an abscess that has matured according to its completion: and this is through the calming of pain, the recession of fever, and the decrease in redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the abscess head, and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary to make the same puncture in the lower place of the abscess, and of more prominent elevation; and let the puncture be penetrating in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in places of tendons, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those, however, which are reflected, proceed with the puncture along that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When, however, the abscess is in fleshy places, then it is better to leave its puncture until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to its completion.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you puncture it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and nastiness, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are punctured according to the breadth of the body in necessity, or according to the need of the limb.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small puncture in small abscesses, and a large puncture in large abscesses, or many incisions by similarity of the abscess's size.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses in which it is necessary to hollow out the skin, and to incise when it has already become like a cloth, and it has reached its end, that it is already dead; such as that which happens in many, like carbuncles and buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And some of them are cut with an incision having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions are administered.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, such as mild superficial abscesses, should be pierced with a superficial or merely a flat perforation.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the abscess is large, and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not be hasty and extract all the pus at that hour; rather, extract only a part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then plug the abscess until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then extract some more of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this repeatedly according to stages, until it comes out; especially if the sick person is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old decrepit person: for the animal spirit is often resolved from the animal with the expulsion of the pus; and perhaps the sick person dies, and you do not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or old cloth.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large, and the perforations are many, then it is necessary that you insert a bandage into every crevice, until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the abscess you have cut off a part of the skin, or hollowed it out in a circle: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when a cloth is woven, or shaved with linen fluff without moisture; and bind it tightly until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary of ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after soaking a cloth in them; and place it repeatedly over the site of the blood flow.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If, however, the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and the treatment, and the powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and from the division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is during the winter, and the site of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you insert pads with warm wine and oil; and place them upon the areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place pads soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of it cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until when the third day shall arrive, as we said, then it is necessary that you open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer in its treatment what is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This, therefore, is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how there is a path to its treatment in particular, chapter by chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the nature of nodules, which are contained within membranes that are like sacs to them: as if they were the plucked follicles of a hen.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Some are fatty; and some contain moisture like mud; and some contain moisture like crushed foods and gruels; and similar to these; and some are hard and stony.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the incision of all of them, and their extraction, there is no fear, as long as in their incision the artery does not oppose.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their incision is, that you should test them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called an Intromissum, until you know what they contain.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial longitudinal incision, in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with an incision from line b to line g.  When the moisture is evacuated, then scrape the container holding that moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if anything remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian unguent if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will corrode what remained of the container.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over the cotum with Egyptian unguent a second, and a third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing remains of the container, for then treat the wound with the unguent until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this form, the section having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in extracting the tunic that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If however the artery resists you, then do what I will tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, as we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision on a stony abscess is easier, because there is little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these abscesses that are on the head of certain people, in which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	This is because I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found the abscess like a solid and hard stone, rough, white, which could not be broken; and if anyone struck it while throwing, they would wound themselves.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In other abscesses, however, occurring on the head, apart from these abscesses which occur on the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, the incision of all of them should be a superficial incision.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make a perforation of them always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus is eased downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then treat them with whatever is appropriate for them in terms of treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	Concerning the incision of Strophulae on the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLII.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur in the neck, are single, and multiple: and are generated from each other: and every strophula from them is within the tunic proper to it, as is in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the varieties of these strophulae are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	And from them are stony ones; and from them are those containing moisture; and from them are malignant ones, which do not yield to treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	Therefore, in that one of them which you see of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is manifest, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to remove it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, from line b to line g, and to scrape it from every side; and stretch the two lips of the skin with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution that the vein or nerve not be cut.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the scalpel not be excessively sharp, lest it injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is unnecessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	However, if you cut a vein or artery, or if it prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound crushed zegi, or some powders that stop bleeding, and bind the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens: or it starts and wants to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped then, therefore return to your operation, until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger if any remaining small tumors or other small ones remain; therefore, cut them and cleanse them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If there is a large vein in the root of the tumor, then it is necessary not to cut the tumor from its root; rather, it is necessary to tie it with a strong doubled thread and leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old lint, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then treat it.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire tumor is cut, then it is necessary to bring together the two edges of the wound and suture it immediately, after you see that no excess remains.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	However, if you see that excess remains due to the size of the tumor, then it is necessary to try to cut its root and remove it, and apply the suture we mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And whatever tumors contain humours, pierce it with a superficial incision, so that the place of its maturation may appear to you, and place the incision from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then, after the incision, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound is now clean.  Then treat it with a wound-healing ointment until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Concerning the excision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients spoke of this excision of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has performed it.  And this is the record of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	In those suffering from quinsy, the excision of the epiglottis should be avoided; since no benefit is obtained by it; because all the veins and lungs are weakened.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no disease in the channel, the excision of the epiglottis should be used, to avoid the loss caused by suffocation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we wish to do it, we should cut the epiglottis under three, or four, circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision across, in the area between two circles, so that the incision is in the skin, not in the cartilage.  This place is suitable for the incision, since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then, he should cut the skin, until, when he reaches the channel, he should avoid the blood vessel if he sees any of them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the skin, as we have described: and the incision of the channel is indicated by the phlegm that comes out of it, along with the rupture of it and the severance of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave the wound open for a time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the time when suffocation is feared has passed, bring together the two lips of the wound in the skin, and sew it together itself alone, without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this account we have given is not applicable except when they see that some of these abscesses have already filled the throat of the sick person: and the sick person is raised up above death, and his breathing wishes to be cut off: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the wound by some respiration, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered the wound to be left open until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and as if of itself: then they ordered the wound to be sewn up, and to be cared for, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw myself is that a certain maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung's passage with it.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moan of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	I therefore explored the wound, and found little blood that had escaped from the wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I believed that she had not cut a vein, nor a major artery, and wind was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	I therefore hastened to and treated the wound until it was healthy, and nothing happened to the maid except hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better state.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Concerning the incision of a hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This abscess, called hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, according to the color of the body, and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural one, certainly, there is no ingenuity.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one, however, is in two ways, one of which is similar to fatty tumors.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other way is similar to the abscess that arises from the knotting of an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it there is fear, and it is not fitting that presumption be made towards it with iron, unless it is small; and you should probe it and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it, as tumors are cut, and extract it with what it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then examine its entire extent.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the area with what is appropriate from the treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Concerning the incision on the nature of Tumors.
Caput XLV.	Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of tumors, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division; and it is necessary for me to explain here the difference between a tumor and a fistula, since it is a cause of doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	Therefore, I say that when a fistula is present, there is heat, fever, and severe pain, until the ebullition of the superfluity subsides and putrefaction is complete; then the fever and heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	However, with a tumor, there is no heat, no fever, no pain, and it contains a kind of enclosed cyst, which is a proper sac for them, and it is according to the color of the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batche (or similar object), large or small.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to treating a tumor, you should examine it and investigate it first with an instrument called an *intromissum*, in the way that its form will be shown in the chapter after this.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating abscesses and all tumors is that you should take this instrument and insert it into the moistest place you find in the abscess; and you should revolve your fingers with it gradually until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then place your hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then withdraw the *intromissum* and consider what comes out in its wake.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore running moisture of any color comes out, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I said in other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture comes out in the wake of the *intromissum*, then know that it is fatty; therefore cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all sides easily; and if possible, place a *kistin* upon it, to extract the healthy part along with the tumor.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the *kistin* is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to extract the healthy part, for this frequently happens, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if some small or large part of it remains, the tumor will return most of the time.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it overcomes you, and a little remains, then fill the wound at its completion with certain sharp corrosive powders, and bandage the wound, and place on it what sits warm over the abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If, therefore, the tumor is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with what causes it to heal.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If, however, a pulsating or non-pulsating vein is contrary to you, then hurry, and fill the place with crushed zegi, and leave it bound for two or three days, until the wound putrefies and the ebullition of blood ceases; then return to cutting that which remained of the tumor.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Concerning the external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVI.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Among them are the forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For among them there is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of tempered iron, with square ends, so that they readily enter the abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of probes, and, no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called a *beris*, that is, a perforator: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For among them there is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are suitable for investigating abscesses, and openings, and fistulas, and buboes by means of it, that which is between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, smooth, and gentle, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely of citron, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the best of them are those made of citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And there are also experiences made of black lead, which are suitable for experimenting with fistulas, the concavity of which has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness with those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And they are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them some are long, some medium, and some short, according to the quantity of the fistula's width and its constriction.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of Hooks, and they are of many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because some of them are simple, namely those which have a single curve: and they are of three kinds, as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind hooks; and they are of three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from them there is a large, medium, and small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that a benefit is achieved with them in scraping knots, for fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little peace from the burning pain they find in the scraping of an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are large ones, and are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal, and are similar to a ray, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end there is a hidden point of a spatula: and it runs inward and outward as desired, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	They are made of metal or amber, round, a little in length, as you see: and let them be to the degree of thinness.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you: so that you may cut off blood with speed when necessary, and then when medicine is not present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them for the cutting of blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy places: such as the muscles of the thigh and hip, and the muscles of the arms, and the nipples, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes from them are made other small instruments similar to hazelnuts, according to their form: with which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or at an incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	Concerning the treatment of male nipples that resemble female nipples.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the nipples of some men become inflated at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble female nipples: and they remain foul-looking, ulcerated.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, whoever abhors it, must cut above the nipples with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from line b. to line g.  Then scrape away all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the wound with a medicament that promotes healing.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If, however, the nipple inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to slit it on its two upper sides with two similar crescent-shaped incisions, each one meeting the other at the ends of both, until there is a larger line containing a smaller one, according to this shape from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape away the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If, however, you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, because of the patient's discomfort, or because of the flow of blood, then you ought to fill the wound with wool soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the perforation of an abscess, which occurs beneath the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter XLVIII.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which occur beneath the nipple are of the nature of hard strophules, which contain cysts, and of those which contain humors.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those of them which contain humors must be incised with a lunate incision, following this form, from line b to line g.  When, therefore, all that is within the abscess is evacuated with pus, then fill it with old wool and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the wool should be removed, and it should be treated with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the nature of knotted strophules, then incise over it, as we have said in the section on strophules, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the wound extends so as to emit pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we have said in what has preceded.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs due to artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter XLIX.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery bursts, and the skin above it closes, an abscess often results.  And similarly, this happens with veins, so that an abscess and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which one knows that an abscess and swelling are due to artery and vein are these: for when the abscess is due to an artery, it is long, aggregated deep within the body, and when you press on the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to a vein is round, on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groins, and in the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very large.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, one should avoid treating it with iron, and that which is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, for that which is from them from the swelling of the artery's opening, make an incision in the skin lengthwise.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery; and free it from its coverings, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce a needle beneath it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then pierce the place, which is between the two ligatures, with a lancet, until all the blood within it is discharged, and the abscess is resolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall away; afterwards, treat it with appropriate ointments, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the abscess be due to the incision of a vein, then you should hold with your hand whatever you are able of the abscess with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a needle beneath the place you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it, until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you in the ligature of the grape, with two ends of thread from two sides.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If, however, you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire abscess at the incision of the needle; press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in its middle, until that which is within it comes out; then cut away the excess skin, and leave that which is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place upon it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, so also an abscess occurs in nerves: this occurs in them through blows, or through excessive exertion, and similar causes; and it occurs most often in the areas of the helpers [muscles], or the heel, and in every place where joints move; and it is a severe abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many cases without pain; and when it is squeezed forcefully, the infirm person feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not a deep-seated collected abscess, but rather is under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not advance forward, or back to the rear.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with a knife.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	For perhaps contraction will result.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	However, in that which is on the head or forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it away from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it; then remove it, and close the wound with sutures; and treat it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter LI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Many people frequently have in their bellies, and in other parts of their bodies, growths that are called Fungalia, by reason of their similarity to fungi.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Their root is subtle, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned inward.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And some of them are small, and some of them grow very large.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man, and in his belly there were two growths that were more similar to fungi than to anything else; there was no difference between them, white, with small roots, and their lips turned inward, and split open, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore, I cut them open, and found one weighing about 10 and 8 ounces and the other about 6 ounces.  And the operation for cutting them is this: if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white, moist, with subtle roots, then cut it with a wide scalpel, and have cauteries present in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often a great deal of blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, if the blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it quickly.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a weak and fearful patient from the incision with iron, then take a well-made lead thread and bind it with it: the method for which we described, and leave it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead binding.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore, do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the growth, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the growth is of thick root, then in its incision there is something of fear and dread, especially that which is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then treat it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to cut a growth that is dark coloured, of few senses, and foul in appearance: for it is indeed a cancerous abscess, and I shall come to a discussion of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Concerning the treatment of the navel's eminence.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The navel's eminence arises from many causes.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the abdomen, which is above the belly, and something protrudes from it, either wind, or an intestine, as happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from wind constricted within it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is due to a fissure of the abdomen, and the protrusion is of this sort, then the colour of the abscess is similar to the colour of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears in various locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the protrusion of an intestine, then its location, along with what we have described, is of more diverse variety.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it hides; then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it; and it greatly enlarges at the entrance to the bath and with strenuous exertion.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it increase.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears a blackness from the clivus.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is due to generated flesh: then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed to one amount.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation on it is, that you should consider then, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then you ought to abstain from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it is fear and terror, just as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine or zirb, then you should instruct the sick person to hold their breath and stand outstretched.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Thereafter, instruct him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a broad spatula the area around the navel, over the place you marked with ink.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it tightly around with thread, or with silk cord, a strong binding; and let the knot of the ligature be firm.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscess, extended above the ligature.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you find it already caught by the ligature, then remove the ligature, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine back into the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut away its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however, it is an artery or vein, then go around it a lot.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles, and insert into them two strong threads; and insert the two needles into the circumference you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make pierce through.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie off the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until the stretched flesh rots; and it falls away by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments, until it is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the eminence of the navel is from flesh that is protruding there, or from moisture, then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture, which you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then treat it with what solidifies the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Concerning the treatment of CANCER.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already discussed the classification of cancers, and how to treat them with medicines; and we must be cautious when treating them with iron, so as not to cause ulceration; and we have discussed cancer generated in the womb, and the precautions to take in treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer in the breasts or in the thigh, and similar parts, by removing the entire growth, especially when it is small and beginning.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	However, when it is old and large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not cure anyone of it, nor did I see anyone before me who succeeded in doing so.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the treatment for it, when located as we said, is to proceed and free the afflicted from the black cholera at times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you find it with evident fullness, phlebotomize it.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the afflicted with the preparation in which they will be positioned for the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then insert into the Cancer the hooks that suit it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let the blood run, and do not cut it quickly, but rather squeeze the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with any suitable instrument there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If, however, a contrary flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein occurs, then cauterize the vein until the blood is stopped.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the remaining treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already recounted in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the collection of water occurs: and the signs of every species, and its treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites alone: and it is not approached with iron for the species of tympanitis: nor for the species of hyposarca at all; for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanitis, with medicines, and your treatment has not availed: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another illness with him besides dropsy, such as if there is coughing, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to them: then beware of treating him with iron; because there is fear of that.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If, however, you see the sick person of exuberant strength, and there is no illness with him besides dropsy alone: and he is neither a child nor an old man: then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and a servant behind him press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a pointed, spiny spatula, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it be of two pointed parts, long, with sharp ends, like a spatula.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, let there be something of shortness gradually, so that you do not proceed with it in the operation all the way to the intestines, and harm him.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend the incision from the navel a quantity of three fingers, downward in a direct line above the pubic bone.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If however the generation of dropsy is because of illness of the liver: then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side: and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce through the entire skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the skin, and if you do, as if you are scraping it, and let the amount that is scraped be the quantity of a fingernail, or approximately that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce, if you do so, until the spatula reaches the empty space: and it is the space of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw it out, and introduce into the hole the instrument, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished: to which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side: and the end of it is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see: on its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument arrives at the water, then it itself descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in an hour a medium quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the sick person dies in an hour through the resolution of his animal spirit; or a swoon occurs to him which approaches death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the sick person indicate to you by the strength of his pulse, and by his condition.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it is immediately retained on account of the skin that retains the opening which is above the sifac; of which I spoke, that you should perforate it according to that manner.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then again use the instrument on the second day, if you see the sick person tolerate it; and also extract a small quantity from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error, until only a little remains of the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	However, if you fear for the sick person, and you leave out a great deal of water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines, until he is healed; and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of the water, according to what I have described in that which came before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	Concerning the treatment of infants born with their urinary passages not perforated.
Caput LV.	Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone emerges from the womb of their mother, and the opening of their urethra is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in the wrong place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore, it is necessary to help with its perforation immediately when it is born, with a very fine Spatumili, according to this method.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a fine leaden nail in the opening, and tie it; and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When, therefore, it wants to emit urine, it is removed, and it urinates.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then replace it.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine which flows over the place will not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, the one whose opening is constricted is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in whom the opening is in an improper place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Because in those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis upward with their hand.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line: and it is a very foul sickness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of treatment in him is that the sick person should be placed on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend his penis with a strong pull of your left hand, and cut off the head of the penis from the location of the glans, with a sharp lancet or a pointed scalpel; just as you would cut a reed, or as you would shave something, so that its middle comes out like the head of the penis, and that the opening falls in the middle, as is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And beware of blood flow during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Concerning matters affecting the foreskin and the head of the penis, and concerning its corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These affections frequently occur in the penis, and there is an eminence of foul flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it there is another that is malignant, and another that is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut away until the whole is cleansed.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place upon it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it afterwards with diachylon ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If, however, it is malignant, of foul color, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the albather is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and part of the albather is within the foreskin and part outside, then it is necessary to remove the albather that is inside first, until it is consolidated, then treat the external part: because when you treat them simultaneously, the foreskin is not safe from being pierced.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And such things also occur in the testicles, and the foreskin, with blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that is already blackened, and that which is about to be corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over it after that with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark, and ground, sifted herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply the cautery with the lunar cautery, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for the flow of blood, and a wound when it becomes corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the penis is eroded, and the whole thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra, so that the patient may urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis, and this adhesion indeed occurs only in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon him: and sometimes adhesion occurs because of a wound, or an abscess: therefore it is necessary to exfoliate it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the head of the penis is freed from every part.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish them exquisitely, then it is necessary to exfoliate somewhat from the head of the penis, and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the foreskin is thin, perhaps it is perforated quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the foreskin and the head of the penis with a thin linen cloth that has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with astringent wine, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Concerning the cleansing of infants, and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is proper to boys, it is necessary for us to mark it with a better operation and a lighter path leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	Therefore, I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experiment.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	This is because I have found the majority of artisans and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and they use leeches, and ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And indeed I have already tested all these methods, and have not found a better cleansing than with scissors, and ligation with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer of skin is cut, and the lower layer remains; therefore, it is necessary to make another incision to cut the other, and future pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with the cleansing done by leeches, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured; because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleansing with a claw, perhaps the iron slips out and spoils your operation; and the skin of a child is short-lived by nature, and they are often born in such a way that they do not need cleansing; and I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleansing with shears, and ligature with thread, has shown me a good experiment; because shears are proportional to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	When therefore you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression of a similar shape is made, containing the skin of the penis from every side, with which no error falls at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the proper method of operation is, that you make the boy, especially if he is one of those who understand a little, estimate that you do not do anything except tie a thread to his penis only; and you leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him rejoice and be glad in every way possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and let him not be seated; and conceal the shears in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that the boy sees them not at all, nor anything of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the penis emerges.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it of the dirt that has accumulated on it.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards tie a second ligature a little lower than that.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold the place of the lower ligature with your index finger and thumb, applying a good grip, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then quickly lift the skin upward and pull out the head of the rod.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then allow the blood to run slowly (for this is better) and place powder on top; and over the powder, a cloth on which is spread the yolk of a hard-boiled egg in rose water, stirred with good fresh rose oil: and leave it on top until the next day; and treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the scissors for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be blunt, and be sloping; so that the branch of the nail does not protrude from them; and let the length of the two sharpened parts be the same as the length of the two handles, equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	An error, however, occurring in cleansing is: because perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partially escaped at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary to extend it from your hour with your fingernail before the place becomes an abscess; and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then pull it out with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	However, if three days have passed, and that which is under the rod remains swollen, an abscess: then leave it until the abscess is mature, and scrape it off easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you, and beware of the head of the rod.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders, which we have described in the treatise on powders; and if it is cut from the skin beyond measure, and extends to the upper parts, it will not harm it even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or a growing flesh, and similar things to those that we have mentioned concerning methods of treatment in the division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the urine is not released, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over on his knees.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him stretch his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man strain his breath as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Thus, pressure is applied to the neck of the bladder for the expulsion of the stone to the rear: therefore, the urine is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If, however, it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the sick person, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: it should be of silver, and be thin, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird in its thinness, and long like one and a half palms; with a thin tube at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of the urine's exit through it is that you take a doubled thread, and tie wool or tow, a good ligature, to its end; and insert the thread's end into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any wool protrudes, but insert it into the tube with force, as if hoisting it up.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the sick person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder and his penis with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it upward from the navel's area.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then drive the syringe within it, until it reaches the bladder, and the sick person senses that it has reached the empty space: and this is not done in this manner unless because the passage, in which it travels, is winding.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the urine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary path: and again use the syringe, and do not cease to do it, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When a sore occurs in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or pus is collected in it, and the force is to instill water and medicines into it: then it should be done with an instrument called a Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is indeed deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other side, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the hollow place, in which that which propels it is situated, should be according to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is pulled with it, humidity is drawn out; and when it is propelled, it expels it to a distance; according to which the clepsydra does, by which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in the battles of war.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore, when you wish to project the moisture into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the moisture, and pull with that which propels it upwards, for the moisture is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce its end into the tube, according to what we have described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then propel the moisture with that which propels it, for that moisture arrives at the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of a fine enema, by which the bladder is enematized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver, or brass: whose head be higher, similar to a small alms-dish, and beneath it a sinus into which a ligature falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a ram's bladder, and put into it the moisture with which you wish to enema the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two sinuses with a strong ligature of double thread; and warm that moisture a little over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then introduce the end of the enema into the tube, afterwards press your hand on the bladder with a fitting pressure, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If however a bladder is not present, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around its circumference.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then introduce a strong thread into those openings, as they revolve.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then close the circle, as a flask is closed; after you put in it what you wish of the moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by pressing with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	Concerning the extraction of the Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	We have already spoken in the division of the species of Stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have spoken of the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of each of them; and I have spoken of the stone in which operation is done with the hand and incision: and the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is fixed in the urethra; and I am recounting it with clear explanation and brevity.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	Therefore, I say that a stone generated in the bladder happens most often in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And among its signs is that the urine departs from the bladder like water in its subtlety, and white sand appears in it, and the infirm person rubs his urethra, and suffers with it, and hangs down often.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it becomes erect, and the anus emerges with it in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And the cure is easy for children, as long as they do not reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, in young people it is moderate, in that it lies between those two: and the cure is easier for the one whose stone is larger; and if it is small, the cure is conversely more difficult.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the faeces that are in their intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick person be taken up with their feet, and shaken, and moved downwards, so that the stone may descend to the depths of the bladder, or jump out of a high place at times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then have him sit between your hands prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder may be inclined downwards.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately proceed with the incision over it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe your index finger with the oil of your left hand, if the sick person is a boy; or the middle finger if he is a full grown youth; and insert it into his anus, and examine for the stone, until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outwards against the place whose incision you desire; and order a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to extend the testicles upwards with his right hand; and with his other hand, to remove the skin that is beneath the testicles in the part near the place where the incision is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the Spatumile, which has this shape.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find it in the space between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left flank; and let the incision be over the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision is wide externally and narrow internally, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to emerge from it, not larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And know that the stone, which has angles and edges, makes its exit difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, to the one with angles and edges, add a fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary to devise something over it: either to string over it with a well-formed instrument, the tip of which is like the Moon, that it may string over the stone and not escape from it; or to introduce a slender instrument, curved at the end, beneath it.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot do so over it, then widen the opening a little.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something from the blood overcomes you, cut it away with a zegi.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If however the stones are more than one, then drive the largest first towards the bladder's opening.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, drive the small one after that; and similarly do if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If however it is very large, then it is ignorance to cut over it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the sick person one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him; because the place does not completely heal.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion, until it comes out; or devise means for its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood; and bind it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; as is done for a hot abscess.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then lay the sick person on his back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have therefore loosened it, embrocate the place with water and much oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with diapason ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however a hot abscess, and corrosions, and similar things, happen added to the wound: such as if blood clots in the bladder, and prevents urine from passing; and this is recognized from the passing of blood with the urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and extract that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever is suitable for treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary in the entire course of treatment, to bind the two hips, and apply, because of the medicines that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If a stone is small, and is in the channel of the penis, and is fixed in it, and the exit of urine is hindered, then treat it with what I described before you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often you will be spared from incision by this treatment, for I have already tested it.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is to take a perforator of iron, of which this is the form, triangular end, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread, and tie the penis with it under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and turn the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outer part of the penis.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it breaks, and emerges with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If however this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something preventing it: then tie a thread below the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut above the stone on the penis itself between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And the ligature of the thread below the stone is not necessary, except so that it does not return to the bladder; and the other ligature on top, except so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you to elevate the skin upwards when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	Concerning the extraction of the stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Little stone is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if a stone happens to any of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden due to many methods.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or having husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well-knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the stone's location: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a female physician, well-knowing: and little is found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If truly you keep her private, then seek a chaste, subtle physician, and present a female midwife well-versed in matters of women, or a woman who hints at a part of this art: make her present, and especially to her, let her do all that you command her from the inquiry concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	First of all, that she should see if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she insert her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak woman's vagina, and inquire about the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder, and compresses it with a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then let her cut upon it at the midpoint of the vulva near the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and let her finger not be removed from the stone, holding it tight; and let the incision be small at first.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then let her insert a ray upon that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision according to the proportionate quantity that the stone emerges from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that the species of stones are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For among these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, a long one, and a round one having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore know its species, so that this may be shown to you about that which you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore the blood overcomes you, then add in the place of the crushed zegi, and hold it for one hour, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone emerges: and do as I have prepared for you from the instruments, which I have spoken of in the extraction of stones in men, so that you may help yourself by them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If, however, the flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then place powder upon the place, and bind it with suitable ligatures: and do not change it: and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then treat the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When, therefore, the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the place putrefies, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LXII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	A watery hernia is not present unless there is a collection of moisture in a white sifac, which is under the skin containing the testicle: and it is called sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own membrane, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the testicle, until it is corrupted: which is another testicle, and the skin of the testicle is between the white sifac, which we have said: and this does not occur except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hernia indeed is from the weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out upon them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow to the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For either its color is sloping toward yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is most.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the collection of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white sifac which we said, then the abscess is round, somewhat the length of an egg; and the testicle is not apparent, since the moisture encompasses it on every side.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in the proper membrane to itself, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of this, a man thinks it is another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the inserted square, whose form preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromiss, judge concerning that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When, therefore, we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, that he be bled if possible for him, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he shall be laid on his back upon a somewhat high object, and place many cloths beneath him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit you upon his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right side, who shall extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a broad spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, nearly to the pubic bone; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac that contains it; and scrape it and observe it, or beware of this, so that you remove it; and let your scraping, with which you scrape it, be on the part that hangs more with the egg; and subtly examine it with the scraping, to the extent that is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles containing it; and cut the sifac however you are able to cut it, either with its entirety or in pieces, especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If, however, the egg protrudes outward from its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, return it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then aggregate the two lips of the testicular skin with sutures.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then treat it like other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If you find a corrupted egg, black with other discoloration, then you must tie off the vessels, which are the suspensories, fearing a flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory, and remove the egg: afterwards treat it with what we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If indeed water is aggregated in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part according to what you did to the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, so that it is one operation, then do so: afterwards wipe away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And introduce into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil: and place outside wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the belly area: and place over it doubled cloths, and they are cushions: and tie them over with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness: and make the ends with which they are pressed from cotton, or damp wool: and they are aggregated with a constriction in the lumbar region of the breeches: and one end takes over the anus up to the back, and the second takes to the side of the comb: and two ends over the two thighs below, and two other ends over the two groins, and the whole constriction is aggregated in the lumbar region of the breeches.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the incision site with an iron: and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery, and cut with it the skin of the testicles: and it is heated, as we have described: until when a whitish substance containing water is revealed: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	It resembles the Greek letter.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce it with it, and it is heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then stretch the sifac with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible, until you remove all of it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And be careful, from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than the operation with section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, however, opposition occurs to you at the time of the section, or a hot abscess at the time of the cautery, or a blood flow, or anything else: then it is necessary that you treat whatever causes opposition to you from it with the treatment that suits it, according to what has been stated before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the patient is timid and does not expect this operation because of its horror, then administer the perforation as I describe it: and so it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a broad spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide until all the water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place a poultice on the location, and bind it, and let it run until the remaining water is discharged; then treat it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, there is resistance to the outflow of water at the time you pierce it, and that resistance is only because a white cloth creates resistance in the wound opening, and prevents the escape of water, then it is necessary that you insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of hydrops is extracted, the shape of which preceded: or add a little to the wound operation.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that the water returns and collects after six months, or about that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When therefore it collects, then let it be pierced according to the same method, and the sick person will pass their days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the section concerning this tumor, there is a fear leading to destruction in many conditions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its removal is saved from it.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which testicles are composed; and this happens from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from a sharp or acrid superfluity that is discharged to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and pain is not found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries and their inflation; as its recollection has already preceded; or from the inflation of veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Therefore, that which is from them, from the inflation of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary that you touch it completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	But that which is made from the inflation of the veins, nothing is spread from it by compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible now that a section be made on this type, and on the remaining flesh; and it is, as to sever the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the egg upwards, and pull it out with a white sifach: and free the suspensorium from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensorium after you have freed it from every part of the egg's parts.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an adhesion between something of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free the whole adhesion and cut it with a circular incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you cut the whole of it and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is complete, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	Concerning the treatment of Ramicis, which is with the Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Vitis is an abscess enclosed in a certain covering, similar to a bunch of grapes, with a softening of the testicles: and it causes difficulty in movement and exercise, and walking, for the afflicted.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded its remembrance.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But it is necessary, as we say, to perform the operation on it according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	Therefore I say that it is necessary to have the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then move the suspensory of the testicles downward.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the vessels that are near the penis; and let another servant hold them, and stretch them with forceful extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad, sharp spatula in a transverse section directly across the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape away from every side, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Afterwards, insert a needle with double thread into them, and tie it at the first of the places where the veins occur, and tie it again at their last.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut it in the middle, in a straight section along the length of the body, and remove that which aggregates from putrid, foul humors.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds, in which the force of producing pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For there is no evil through it.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	However, if all vessels in the veins occur, then it is necessary that the testicles be extracted along with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it wastes away, or dries up, and there is no benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	Concerning the treatment of intestinal colic.
Caput LXV.	Chapter LXV.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The outcome of this colic is from a section that occurs in a distended sifach over the abdomen in the groin area, from the mirach of the abdomen.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach, or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal towards the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it, when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes a very severe pain to occur immediately at its beginning; and the abscess is different, appearing beneath the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course towards the exterior of the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with the intestine, a zirb; and this is called a intestinal ramex and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with flatulence.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes faeces run into the intestine and are retained there; and it is a harm to the sick person, because it causes a mild pain, and especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these kinds of illnesses, there is fear with iron; therefore, one must be cautious in its use.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is that you should instruct the sick person to draw back the intestine with their hand into the inner cavity if it obeys the withdrawal.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie on his back with his neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then stretch the skin that follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then insert hooks into the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be, as much as possible, so that an egg can emerge from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape off the siphak and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is exposed on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is beneath the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and break off with it the adhesion that is on the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand; and with this, stretch the white siphak upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and command the assistant to stretch the egg upwards; and you break off the adhesion that is behind the complete separation.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And examine with your fingers that there is nothing there of the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If however you find anything of it: then push it towards the lower belly.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles that follows the incision; then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then arrange some of them over some others with a figure which is in the manner of a cross; and tie them with the alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles, with a violent ligature, until no vessel which nourishes them can send anything to them; so that a hot abscess does not occur from this.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place another ligature again outside the first ligature, distant from it by no more than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, leave out from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity of the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely around, and remove the egg from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut into the lower part of the skin of the testicles, with the incision from which blood and pus run, as we have narrated in that which has gone before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wound; and apply the ligature which we have narrated.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sifach which we mentioned is cauterized, after its incision, fearing blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this happens many times.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligature until it falls away by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, its falling is delayed, then it should be soaked with warm water; and place upon it that which we mentioned, until it falls away.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	About the windy rupture.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LXVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this rupture, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron for its treatment.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed the first ones said that it happens as we have described in the rupture that is with the vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to tie the vessels after the incision, on them, with ease, below; then cut in the middle, and finally treat with that which opens it, until the vessels fall away; and treat the wound, as we said, until it is healed.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	Of the rupture that occurs in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When rupture occurs in the inguinal region, as we have said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if something does descend, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if time passes with it, a fissure is added to the scrotum, until the intestines descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And that occurs from the stretching of the scrotum, which is in the inguinal region, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the scrotum stretches; then the area softens, and the place becomes suppurative, and protrudes.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding account stated.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with an iron, according to this method: and it is so that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then cut the suppurated and protruding place of the rupture, by a cut across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the scrotum and what is under the skin, until when the white scrotum is exposed, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a rod, and place it over the protruding place from the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then sew the two protruding places on the end of the rod from the scrotum, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then withdraw the end of the rod.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the scrotum at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the threads, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it is consolidated.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	For the scrotum contracts, and the protrusion of the rupture is not added.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Of the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	Many times the skin of the testicles in some men is softened, for which reason the flesh which is between them is softened, and its appearance is made foul.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked for treatment of it, that he place the sick man on his back, and cut away all the skin that has been softened from the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he shall unite the two lips with sutures: and if you wish, sew first the excess softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the sutures firm.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then treat the remaining wounds with care, until they are healed, and the threads fall out.
¶ De Castratione.	Concerning Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law; and because of that, it would be permissible for me not to mention it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two methods.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, and so that he may know its treatment for the one who has experienced it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other method is that we often need the castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	Therefore, I say that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by fissure and section.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is this: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles are softened and relaxed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they are dissolved and no longer appear under the touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut above every testicle with one cut, until when two testicles are exposed; then cut them after you have skinned each, and do not leave on them any of the sifaket other than the thin sifak which is on the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves some of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Caput LXX.	Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	A hermaphrodite is from men in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is that there appears in it, in the space below, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, with hairs; and sometimes urine flows from what is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one form, and it is a woman's vulva on top of the pubis, like very small male testicles protruding outward; one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of three types, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh until their impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then treat them as with other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	In the second type, however, of men, from which urine emerges, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the incision of the vulvar swelling, and of the protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	A swelling may perhaps be added to the natural structure, until it becomes disfigured and unsightly in appearance; and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it expands like that in men and reaches the point of intercourse.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, it is necessary to hold the excess swelling with your hand, or with a hook, and to cut it; and do not be extreme in the incision, especially in the deep root, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the treatment for wounds, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that grows is flesh that arises in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it; and perhaps it protrudes outwards in the likeness of a tail; and because of that, some of the ancients called the illness "tailed.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut it, as we cut the swelling, and to treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is a non-perforated woman's vagina.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, as it were, a woman's vagina that is not perforated, or has a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	Accidental is from an illness that preceded: and indeed it comes about either from added flesh growth, or from subtle, or thick syrups: and it comes about either deep within the womb, or on its sides, or at its upper, or lower part: and it hinders intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps hinders menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of it is made through the observation of the midwife, if an apparent obstruction is near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however the obstruction is from a thin syrup, and is near the two lips, then hurry, and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And it is, that you place pads upon the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs spread.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then spread the two lips with strength, until the thin syrup is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the place; and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place is not consolidated again.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If however the syrup is thick, dense: then it is necessary to cut it with a broad spatula similar to a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If however the obstruction is born of flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it; and have with you medicines that soothe the flow of blood without causing a mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead cannula, so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days; and administer a bandage of dry linen, then treat the rest with further treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes there arises in the womb a birth of other flesh; it is therefore necessary that they be cut in this way: while it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, there should be no opposition with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor rubeae in women's vulvas.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins, until much blood flows from them continually.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Therefore, when hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already stated their species and their signs in the division; and I will say here which of them receive a cure, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure with iron for them.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	However, those of them which are in the orifice of the womb over which the senses fall, are those that are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary to put the woman in a cool house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the thelil with shears, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them, at the flow of blood, from one of the powders of the incisions without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then let her feet be pressed against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, place her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and pomegranate bark, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If the blood is thus cut off with it, it is good; and if not, apply cupping glasses to the back and nipples, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, Pontic wine, and apply it to the sore.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When the abscess rests, then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, it is necessary to incise what appears from it, according to what I said in the thelil equally, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Concerning the perforation of the exit of the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many types of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, boils, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already discussed all these illnesses and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary to discuss in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is done with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its inception is sharp with its percussion, and heat, and fever: and you see it reddening: if sensitivity falls upon it, then do not hurry with its perforation: and treat it with that which aids maturation, until when the sharpness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a seat that slants two seats, and lean back, or be placed upon her back, and draw her feet to the lower part of the belly: and let her thighs be spread out, and let her place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is made.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you probe deeply into the womb of the woman: so that that which enters from the instrument be no more than the depth of the womb, and hurt the delicate one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	If, however, the instrument be more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions on the covering of the womb's depth: so that the entire entrance of the instrument into the depth of the womb may be prevented: and it is necessary that it place the turning which runs on the instrument, from the upper side: and that the attendant hold the instrument, and that the attendant turn the turning, until the depth of the womb be opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and it is touched by hand, and is smooth and soft, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place on the wound a linen cloth soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency: and place the cloth, and extract the section into the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place externally upon the womb, and upon the vulva, clean wool soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then treat it after two days with the ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is injected with water and honey: then with water in which the lily root, or long aristolochia, has been boiled: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inwardly in the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we have said in the division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	On the teachings of midwives, how living embryos, born in a non-natural form, are treated.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter LXX.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to know, first of all, the form of natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	Therefore, among its signs is that when you see a woman pressing downwards, and desiring to smell the air, and relief is upon her from the burden of childbirth, and the embryo's exit is hastened: then know that this birth is in a natural form, and its exit is upon its head, and the afterbirth with it: either hanging or suspended from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her abdomen be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it descends upon its head, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed from those superfluities by a good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	Any birth other than this one is unnatural, blameworthy.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the fetus emerges upon its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or its head and one of its hands emerge: or its abdomen emerges: and perhaps it is turned over upon its neck, and similar examples of blameworthy forms.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, astute in all these matters, and to guard herself against error and deception: and I am showing every form from them, and how the nature is within it, and how it is signified by it, and how one should act upon it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the fetus emerges upon its head in its natural expulsion, and it becomes difficult for the woman, and the birth becomes difficult for her, and you see that her strength is already weakened: then have her sit upon a seat, or let women hold her: and apply vapors to her vulva with decoction of fenugreek and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and with it split the afterbirth, and cut it with her fingernail, until that which is in it from moisture runs out: and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If, however, it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be given an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then order her, after the enema, to compress herself; and make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will emerge immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus emerge first, you should gently and gradually draw them back.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If, however, it does not yield in its entry, then place the woman on a stool, and raise her feet upwards; then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman is to be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them and extract the remainder of the fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it with equanimity; for it will emerge.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is upon its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus emerges on its feet, then it is necessary to push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward, straighten it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When therefore they emerge up to the hips, then command him to be pressed, and make him sneeze with concoction; for it will emerge, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For it will then emerge with easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is hindered with all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum: and pound all in a mortar with good pounding; then line with it the woman's vulva, and the lower part of her abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until it reaches the hypochondria.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make her a poultice of myrrh, and apply it.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then make her sit upon a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze, and bind her mouth and nose, and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the foetus will depart immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the foetus is upon the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it emerges according to this form, then gently introduce her hands into it.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman shall lie upon her back, and her feet shall hang downward; and she shall lie upon the bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press gently upon her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out that which is under her feet from the pillows, until it is prepared at the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a forceful motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press gently on that which is above the hypochondria, until the fetus rises upwards.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her insert her hands, and gently straighten the fetus; and command the woman to bear down, until the fetus emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus, hanging sideways from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Let his hand be inserted into the reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If however he cannot reduce it, then lift the woman, and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If however she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the liniment that you have prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If however she receives it in childbirth, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and set the fetus according to its natural form: and make the woman sneeze, and command her to compress herself until it emerges.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is upon its neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it around, and adjust it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When therefore it is adjusted, then place upon its vulva what we have narrated of oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and command her to incline to her right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then command her to compress herself; and make her sneeze with seasonings.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the prepared fetus upon its side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cleave the afterbirth with your nail, until it is evacuated from the moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then urge the fetus inwards, until you place it as it should be; and command the woman to compress herself several times; for it will emerge through a gentle exit.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is unusual and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	However, five is unnatural, and they do not entirely live: and though they multiply, they are contained by one placenta; and they are separated by a sort of partition, distinguishing between them, tied to the umbilical cord of each.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they emerge like a single fetus emerges with a natural, easy exit; and they emerge with an unpraised exit, as we have recounted.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach the unnatural forms we have mentioned, then treat them as we have recounted; and let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and slowness, and devise a strategy according to every form with what is prepared for her from a leading skill towards health.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	A recollection of what is formed in the womb from embryos, and miscarriages.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb; and it has already been verified with me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps something similar to that will come to her; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said in the division from medication, and it does not emerge, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound constitution, and is not afflicted with any of the accidents from which harm to her is feared, then it is necessary that the woman be laid supine on a bed, on her back, and her head be lowered, and her legs raised; and the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be bound to the bed, so that her body is not disturbed during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the os uteri with humid oils, along with the mucilage of marshmallow, fenugreek, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then she should gently insert it into the uterus.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should seek, with it, the place where she should fix the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is ready to descend with its head: then fix the hooks in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in places close to the ribs, and beneath the hypochondria.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If however the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and place its curve in the space between the fingers of her left hand; and she should insert it with her hand gently, and fix the hook in any of those places we have mentioned, until she reaches the empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then she should fix another hook, or a third, if needed, in opposition to it, so that there is an equal contraction, and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not be only in a straight line, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased; just as happens with a tooth during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between it, that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it remains, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with oil and insert them on the side, to turn around with them what remains.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another place, which is higher; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore a hand emerges before the other parts, and it is not possible to return it, due to its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until, when the whole emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint or at the elbow; and thus it is necessary that you do for the other hand, and for the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If however the fetus's head is large, or constriction happens to it in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary to insert a spiny Spatumile between the fingers and split the head with it, and remove the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, the shape of which is found with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that is after this one.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, he should do this if the fetus is of a large-headed nature, then it is necessary to separate it with algengematu; or extract it with misdach, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head emerges, and is constricted at the fork, then it is to be split, until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If however it does not become entangled, nor yields to exit, then cut the head into pieces, as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If the lower part of the abdomen is ulcerated, or has dropsy in it, then it is necessary to pierce it, until moisture flows from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If however the fetus is over its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the womb is slight.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If however it is constricted at the belly, or chest, then it is necessary to extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand: and split the belly, or chest, until that which is within them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If however the remaining limbs are removed, and the head returns, then the Midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then she should insert her hand deep into the womb, and search with it for the head, and pull it with her fingers until it reaches the mouth of the womb; then she should insert one hook, or two hooks, into it, and pull it with that.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If however the mouth of the womb is constricted, on account of a hot abscess which has occurred in it, then it is not necessary to labor upon it, but it is necessary then to administer the effusion of moist, fatty things, and apply plasters; and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to make it straight; then administer what we have said about a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then let it descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose belly a foetus had died; then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another foetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled until it opened, and it began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore, I placed over it certain plasters of strong attraction, and a bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then a few days passed, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	Therefore, I was amazed by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore, I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	Then I investigated the wound, and removed many bones, the woman being in better condition: and she thus lived a long time, and discharged a little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not consider this extraneous, except because it contains knowledge and help for what the skilled physician administers with his hand in the treatment.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of a stretcher, by which books are equalized, with two pivots equally placed at the two ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this pivot should be finer than the stretcher, and to make it, either from ebony or from boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each piece of wood should be about two fingers, and the margin of each of them is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fixed on both sides, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the opening of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two pivots.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the pivot by which the matrix is opened.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to it, finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its end there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is approximately a palm: and the width of each is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	Therefore, when you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two joined additions into the matrix: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with scissors, equally according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the matrix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Another form of Vertigo, which the ancients called the Impelling Form, by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The Almisdac form, by which the large head is crushed: and it is likened to a pair of tongs, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes elongated, like forceps of this shape, as you see, which have teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and crushed.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The Almisdac form by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of a hook with one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of a hook with two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps with saw-like teeth, with which the fetus's head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of a scalpel with two ends for severing the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two broad scalpels.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	All these instruments are used, and the more their types multiply, and are prepared by the craftsman, the more swift is his operation, and the higher is he regarded by men, because of their number.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not disdain any instrument, lest it not be prepared with you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	Concerning the extraction of the Secundine.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the Secundine is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with condiments: and grasp your hand over her mouth and nostrils.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If therefore it emerges through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not, then take a pot, and pierce a hole in the lid: and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sseham, cassia wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a reed stopper over the hole of the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb: and hold it until the vapor reaches the cavity of the womb.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge: then order the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marshmallow mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and seek the afterbirth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds it, then let her take it and extend it gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it be attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until, when she finds the afterbirth, she extracts it gradually in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall away with a sudden pull; rather, it ought to be moved easily to the right and left sides, then an amount of traction should be added.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For it then obeys, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the os of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing, and with a medication of a pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware lest you tire yourself in repeating the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	But it is necessary that whatever emerges from it to the os of the womb be tied to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then administer a clyster to her with the tetrapharmacon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For this will indeed putrefy it after days, and it will dissolve and emerge.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it putrefies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, suitable fumigations must be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated during the retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made of glass similar to a flask, or of bronze: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the prunes: let it hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	Concerning the treatment of an unopened anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born with their anuses not perforated, which are already obstructed by a thin sifac.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, the midwife must perforate that sifac with her finger; and if not, let her perforate it with a sharp Spatumili; and let her be careful not to touch the flesh.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place upon it wool soaked in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If however you fear that it will become obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and let it be removed when the child wishes to evacuate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now obstruction of the anus also happens from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat it with what we have said concerning treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Concerning the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter Eighty.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are swellings and thicknesses which occur near the anus externally; or in the space of one part; and it is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that swelling has become longstanding, it opens, and watery white moisture or thin pus flows from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are penetrating fistulas from these.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore, penetrating ones are recognized by that which comes out through evacuation and windiness, when the sick person uses evacuation; and perhaps worms come out of them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And some of those fistulas, when they are penetrating, are in the space reaching to the bladder and to the urethra.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And some of them are penetrating to the hip joint and to the tail bone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	By this, a penetrating fistula to the anus is recognized, even from one that is not penetrating, that you insert your index finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe into the fistula through the air, or iron, when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then insert into it a thin lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe, or hair, in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything emerge from the opening in terms of excretion, nor wind, nor worm as I said, then know that it is not penetrating: therefore, hasten to the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus, then its sign is the excretion of urine from it, and its prevention from this that the place be consolidated with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	However, if it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone, then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting in it to the bone, and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always, and that treatment does not work in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labor and vanity to him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	However, in the one that is not penetrating, and not ancient, healing is hoped for with a saw, according to what I tell you, and what I have already tested: and it is so that the sick person lies between your hands on his back, and raise his legs above his hips, and his hips are inclined to his stomach.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce a lead or copper probe, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If, however, the patient feels it around the anus, then it is necessary that you insert your index finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If, therefore, you feel the probe already to have penetrated itself detected, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh: then you know certainly that it is penetrating: therefore, do not labour on it, for there is no cure of it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They have said, however, that in some men the flesh heals, and that from the medicine by which help is hoped for it is to apply a thin cautery according to the size of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and to insert it heated into the fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat it twice or three times, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh, which are like bird's feather quills, have been burned.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh parts come out; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If, therefore, it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if a probe emerges, and it has not reached your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such is the case: and you see a fistula in that which follows the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go on cutting with the probe which is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the probe's tip reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh, which resemble the quill of a bird, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation so that you cut those flesh: then it is better, and more quickly helpful, to cauterize it with fire, or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because cautery with fire aggregates good habits, by burning those added flesh, and by cutting off the blood, and drying the moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then treat it with bandages wrapped in butter, or pounded herbs, until the area discharges pus, and those burnt flesh emerge in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then treat the wound with solidifying ointments, which produce firm flesh: and there are medicines in which there is astringency and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and is extended by bodily superfluity: then introduce your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a membrane, and between you and it is a veil of sifac, or flesh, and it is near to penetration: then there is no operation on it, unless according to the path of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	For this is because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it itself, as we said: or to dissect it, until you obtain its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert ligatures, and healing from close proximity.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed too far with the dissection, so that you do not cut the muscle surrounding the anus, and that a spontaneous expulsion of excrement occurs without the patient's will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then treat it with what we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	For perhaps it will be healed: or you will lengthen the membrane, and cleanse it after you have cut it close to the anus, as we said, either with tongs, or with another instrument of sharp end.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered flesh that are in the incision, until where you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula remains open in the interior part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this way: and it is when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is in the side of the anus near the body's surface with the skin and the margin of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing hides, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert into it a thread wrapped in five threads, and about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If, therefore, it is penetrating the inner margin of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and join the two ends together; and tie each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread cuts into the flesh, the better tie it, until those flesh which are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If however the fistula's opening is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not in you to do that on account of the muscle, so as not to injure it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then do with it as we have said, until it is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	A pointed spatula, by which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Concerning the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are of two types.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Either they are within the anus, like bags of coal or prunes, or like bunches of grapes themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And of them there are small and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And some are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are mostly small moist lumps, from which flows yellowish water or little blood with persistent running; and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of that which is within the anus is that you command the sick person to strain: and it is expressed until it emerges from the anus, and you see the atheril for yourself.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	However, if the hooks do not hold on them, because of their moisture and their softening, then take them with a rough cloth, or with a double-wool cloth, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and after the incision, powder over them certain hot powders, so that they may stand in the place of a cautery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what went before in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to evacuation, then administer an enema to the sick person containing a small mordicant, so that it may wash away what is in the anus and quickly yield to evacuation when the sick person expels it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If, however, the piles are external from the anus, then their removal is easy: and it is that you take them with your fingernail, or take them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then treat them with what we have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And whoever abhors incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then pull the piles upwards, and make it pierce with the needle at its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be laterally: and tighten the piles with strong constriction.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do that with all the piles, and leave one of them: and do not sew it, so that superfluity of blood runs from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over the anus a cloth soaked in rose-oil, or in oil of caper, and place it over the anus: and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then leave it until it falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For they often occur from the drying out of excrement and constriction of the nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When therefore they become old, and medicine does not work on them, then it is necessary to scrape them with a pointed spatula, or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper crust which prevents their healing is removed.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then treat them until they heal as is proper.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If however they do not heal, then scrape them again with a more forceful scraping than the first, until they bleed a lot and are scraped off; then treat them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted almirmar, and of dry athelil and formicae.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Almirmar is nothing other than a round knot according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a nail; and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and pain arises from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it is necessary to cut that which is around the nail, and to hold it with shears or a hook, and to uproot it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From dry athelil, however, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And many times they occur on the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its treatment is to stretch the athelil, and cut it; or to bind it with a silk thread; or with a bristle, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been mentioned with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now the inverted athelil are eradicated, and not the inverted ones with the instrument that I will name.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	A formica, however, is also a small, filtered, thick eminence above the surface of the body, going deep very much: and when cold finds it, a sensation similar to an ant's bite is felt in it, and it happens throughout the body; and most of it happens in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its treatment is to take a cannula from a goose's feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula over the Formica until the cannula's circle contains its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you separate what is around the Formica; and place it in the depth of the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn to a height, so that the grasp of the deaf thing wrapped around it, and its turning, may be eased.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what is stated in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on the cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Concerning the forms of instruments which are administered for enemas in diseases of the anus, and for loosening the belly, and for colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter Eighty-three.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes the clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of very young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, so too their enemas.
Clistere magnum.	Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	Small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Its tube, that is, the upper end to which the bladder is tied, should be wide according to this method; and it should have a distinction so that the bladder may be tied as you see, and its lower end which is introduced into the anus should be closed, that is, not open, smooth, very, drawing to a point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of rays, and a little thicker; and let the bladder in which the medicines are placed be made from an animal's bladder, or from parchment, which should be according to the shape of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let it be pierced with many holes, as it is rolled, and let the space between each hole be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread made of raw thread, which should be composed of ten threads, or thereabouts, and bind the bladder to it like an asofrat.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore the bladder is placed in it, the head of the enema should be tied at the top between two distinguishing constrictions with a strong tie.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then administer the enema with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the bladder depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The method of administering the enema with it is: to fill the bladder, or the vessel, with medicine that is warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is not excessively hot or excessively cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person should lie on their back, and raise their legs upward; and place beneath them a mat, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with egg white, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant grasp the bladder with both hands together, and squeeze it with force, until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clyster, and let the sick person raise their legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine compels him to an outcome, then let him hold it as long as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it the whole night, it is more beneficial in helping.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If, however, you administer the clyster in illnesses of the belly's loosening, and his exit is quick: then repeat the clyster until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or ulcerating abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin, gentle, from the clysters with which children are administered clysters.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a thin clyster above which there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter Eighty-four.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for the book, and I will speak here of their treatment with the hand and with medicines, according to the completion.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to that by which the wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The things by which wounds are made are often, as the throw of a stone; or the incision of a sword, or knife; or the striking with a lance, or wood, or arrow; and with similar things from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	And the wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or neck, or breast, or belly, or liver; and similar from those members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am narrating the treatments of certain wounds, so as to place that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple wounds of the head, because the remembrance of compounded ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throw of a stone, or similar things, and has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy: and do not delay it: and draw from his blood according to the quantity of his strength: if there is nothing preventing it by phlebotomy, especially if the blood that emerges from the wound is little.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person beware of fullness, and wine, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prevents diminution, then lessen food and do not approach meats, nor wines.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs, a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If however you are certain of a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder which I will describe shortly: and if the air has already changed it, then place on it certain ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If however the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together by means of pads, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If however the wound has already been separated from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore in it firm flesh in place of skin, and command the sick person to be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads, and cooked wheat, until it is like dough: and things similar to them.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone: then cut away the entire putrefied part, and cast it away: then treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	If however in these wounds there is an artery, or vein from which blood flows: and it is not severed by medicines, then search over the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If necessity prompts when that which we have said does not help, then cauterize it until the blood is severed.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	If however these wounds are small, simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that you pulverize this powder over them: because it consolidates them before air changes them.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Method of the Flesh-forming Powder.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take one part of frankincense, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime:  grind the whole thoroughly, and sieve it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it over with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For the medicine is not eradicated from it until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes the lime alone does this, when you do not have frankincense and dragon's blood present; it also accomplishes the same action on many large wounds, when it is appropriate to place it on them and bind them, and the wounds are recent with their own blood, which the air has not altered.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If it has already altered it with some alteration, especially when it is in the summertime, then the intention of applying this powder is not appropriate: therefore treat it with what we have said, so that you place some digestive ointments upon it; or place poultices of barley flour made with water and honey upon it, until they discharge pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then treat the remaining part with the other treatment until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	However, if a fracture in the bone occurs with a wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps; and I will now state the treatment of skull fractures in what is to follow.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Of wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If however a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference between it in treatment, and between a wound of the head when it is simple.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If however the nerve of the neck, or the artery, is already cut: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in it, except to avoid its treatment with anything that produces strong astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the nerves, and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the wound at all: because the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that which is used for treatment be mild from medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tuttia, when washed also with sweet water: and the remaining mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If however the wound is large, then administer sutures: or constrict its lips with pledgets.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If however the wound has depth, or a sinus has occurred in its lower part, in which pus is already collected, then pierce it in the more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, an artery has already been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity calls for it.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, the windpipe has already been cut, or the whole [throat], and the surrounding tissues have been saved, then bring together the skin flaps with sutures over the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe, rather, equalize it, and restore it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a proper ligature, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments containing astringency and desiccation, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it: then if there are fragments of bone within it, extract them all, or as many as you can: and that which is not extracted, leave it until the wound suppurates, and the discharge separates and is relieved.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then powder it with the powder I have described.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If, however, a bone appears in the wound, and a fistula forms, then treat it with that which is mentioned in its chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Concerning a wound in the shoulders.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter Eighty-Six.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If there is a blow from a lance or a knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If, therefore, wind emerges from the wound when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it does not have depth, and is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person; but put attracting ointment on it, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If, however, ointment is not present for you, then place an old rag in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what emerges from it of humidities; and make the sick person sleep over the wound, so that what is collected in it may run.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If, however, three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred in the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the other conditions of him are good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat him with bandages and the rest of the treatment, until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If, however, his healing is excused, and it is always opening up, then know that it has become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from a sword cut or a knife cut, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what has gone before in terms of sutures, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and has cut fragments from it, then examine the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If, however, they are not separate, then leave them until the wound becomes putrid, for their removal will be easier.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	However, for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the judgment in treatment is the judgment that we have stated.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their expulsion.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	A rupture that occurs in the belly is great, medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their introduction, and their stitching, is more vehement and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	It follows, therefore, that their reduction is more difficult if you do not hasten their introduction to their place immediately, because it is inflated, opened, and thickened; wherefore their entrance becomes difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a middle rupture is better; because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures are found in belly sutures, and in the sutures of other wounds of the body; and two other sutures are proper to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper to the suturing of the belly; and I narrate each one to you with explanation and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine protrudes from it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then that is due to one of two ways.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said, or because there is an inflation in the intestine due to the coldness of the air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When, therefore, it is thus, then it is necessary that you heat it, so that you immerse a sponge, or a damp cloth, in only lukewarm water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with squinanthus, and cyperus, and spike, and apply it to the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it, and it is better than plain water in resolving the inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which mallow or mallow has been boiled.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through it the entrance of it is relieved with a small thing.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however its return is excused after this treatment, then cut in the disruption a little, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when prepared, than the incision; and no compulsion is made to cut after necessity and the instrument's failure.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it which is twisted and sharp, and the other part of it not sharp, and the fine end not be with the fineness of a spatula, but rather somewhat duller: and that is which is similar to a wedge, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When, therefore, the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its proper place, if possible over it; for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When, however, the rupture is wide in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you cause the sick person to lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the belly, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus it is necessary that you administer it in great wounds, and in medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then have a pious minister present between your hands, who holds the entire rupture with his hand, and bring together its lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then uncover from it for him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the mode of a single common suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the amount of the wound's width.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then release from the extremity of the rupture the amount of a ring finger, that is, a physician's: and fix one needle beyond that into which you insert a thread at both extremities of the skin, with the two extremities similarly done which are beneath the skin from the interior, until you cause it to penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together the two extremities of the skin, and two extremities of similarly done: and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with a double thread in a circular motion of the needle several times from both sides simultaneously, until the two lips of the wound are brought together with a proper joining.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then release the thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards draw it through with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do that with whatever needles you need, until you complete the tightening of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And the needles should be intermediate in thickness and thinness, because very thin needles cut the flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to enter the skin; therefore, they should be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary to fix the needle in the two closely adjacent skin edges for too long; so that the flesh is not cut quickly, and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and it should not be stretched too far with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from healing.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then trim the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the sick person in their sleep; and place cushions of cloth around them on every side that hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	Because one, or two, or about that many needles are sufficient in their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second common suture is to gather together with the suture four edges: two edges of skin and two edges of a wound, at one time, with a needle on which a thread wrapped around is equal in fineness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have pierced these four edges with the needle, pull the needle back from the side from which you began, so that the thread drawn back falls from the upper part of the wound, so that it is a suture, like a suture of cloth by which cloths are drawn together, and place between each suture a quantity less than the thickness of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	However, this suture is known by men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture I treated a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound's rupture was greater than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had come out from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	Therefore I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space of about fifteen days: and I treated it, and he was healed; and he lived after that for many years, engaged in his affairs.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not treat it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where there was no ointment, nor any of the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	Therefore, I placed an old bandage over the wound twice a day, and diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	I will now describe two proper types of sutures, according to the account of the discourse.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture, and insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and going into the muscle along the length and width of the entire body, leave the end in the side in which you inserted the needle, and let it penetrate the other end from the inner to the outer part at the other extremity.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have thus caused it to penetrate, then let it penetrate in this same extremity mirach from the outer to the inner part: and leave the end sifac, which is on this side, and let the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inner to the outer part: and let it penetrate with your penetration which you cause it to penetrate into the extremity sifac mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates the whole thing.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity, which is from sifac on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it into that skin, and sew the extremity sifac, which is on the other side, with this extremity mirach: and withdraw it from the skin which is on its part, and do it one time, and another: and do it time after time, until you have sewed the whole outside according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the summit of this suture is to sew the skin of the skinners in the way they sew skins: so that you sew sifac one time from one extremity of the skin; and that you leave it another time from another part, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second species of proper suture, which Galen said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	His discourse relates that one should sew it according to the manner in which some physicians sew them, so that they gather every part to its corresponding part naturally: and apply the extremity sifac to its other extremity, and the extremity mirach to its other extremity.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should place the needle at the mirach extremity nearest to you on the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that sole; and leave the two sifac extremities.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the needle and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two sifac extremities, namely on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both, also making them penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other mirach extremities, which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection precedes.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore also Galen's discourse.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is, that you introduce one thread in each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from where it is with you, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who stitch hides equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the treatment of a wound is like the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is, because when you acquire a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you replace the intestine, and mend it, and fit it, then place it upon the incarnating powder.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already altered the wound, then place certain ointments upon it that are present with you, until they produce pus, and the threads fall away, and the wound is consolidated, and mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as is the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If, however, the medicines are not present with you, then place on it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old cotum; and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicine in many dispositions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If, however, you fear that the wound communicates with the main members in the injury, then it is necessary to immerse soft wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the places that are between the groin and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If, however, he feels pain, or pricks, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens) then enema him with astringent, black, warm wine; especially if putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and a penetrating exit has been made to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier healing; and that which is from those which are subtle is of more difficult healing.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	If, however, that which proceeds from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If, however, a space has passed and it has already become green or black, then you must tie it with a thread above the place that has blackened from it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and hang the two ends of the thread from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the pull on it may be relieved for you, and its extraction in the case of a zirbum, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	A recollection of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people; for this reason, because I have seen someone who was wounded in his belly by the impact of a lance, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old; and it became a fistula, and excrement and wind came out of it.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore, I applied a treatment, until I was not confident in its healing; nor did I cease to refine it, until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, lest an evil accident should befall the sick person in his belly; and no such evil accident befell him from that.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and having intercourse, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied in this manner.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those that have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When therefore it sits upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not loosen.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do this with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it, and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached to the intestine, until the intestine is fed, and healed, and no harm befalls the sick person at all.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible that the intestine be tied also with a thin thread: that which has been scraped from the animal's intestine, attached to it after it is introduced into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is so that you take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and much of it is scraped off.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie a thin linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then introduce that thread into the needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then return it to the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with ants and intestine is only according to the path of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	Know that a wound that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no ingenuity except for refinement, nor is its healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Concerning the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, does not heal, and continually discharges pus, and cannot be cut away: then it is universally called a fistula, wherever in the body it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula, in truth, is a filtered, hard, white knot; with no pain, having the concavity of a bird's feather; and for that reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in some hours moist, which discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is cut away in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is abundant, and sometimes scarce; and sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I already mentioned in the division, when I spoke of wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not due to anything other than one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because there is much filth and impurity; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable for its treatment; or because the corruption prevailing in the region is a type of pestilence, or by its property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of illnesses is difficult, and the healing of boils is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones in it.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with the medicines in the division; and it is necessary here to make you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by surgical means with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from among them are fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinuses; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the joints of compound structures, such as the hand and foot; and from among them are those that proceed to the proximity of the main limb, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, which of these fistulas is in this manner, is from among illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and the occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If, however, there is any fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to achieve knowledge of it, then take a probe, made of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and investigate it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a probe of fine lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Since lead, with its gentle body, is alleviated and curved around the twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, irrigate from those openings of its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture with which you irrigate it goes toward the other openings and runs from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire thoroughly, according to whatever method is possible for you, to ascertain whether there is a bone, or a nerve, and the cavity of the fistula is distant or near; or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over all of it with your utmost strength, with your questioning, by which you question the sick person, and the discovery of pain upon pressing with your hand upon the location, and similar indications and causes of accidents of the abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When, therefore, you have stood over all of it in this true manner, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you should then consider whether the fistula is near, visible, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you: then cut the fistula according to what has been said by me before, and remove whatever is in it by filtration and corrupt flesh, that arises within its opening from flesh, or boils, and similar things; and treat it until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is of deep and distant depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you cut it in depth as much as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply strips soaked in sharp medicines, and insert them into the cavity of the fistula that you have grasped with the iron. Do this with it several times, until the sharp medicine has corroded everything remaining in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If, however, it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is confirmed to you, then seek it out and cut it according to what I have told you: if nothing prevents you from a vein, or nerve, or major member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If therefore bone is found by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with that which makes it flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it is not healed, and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Therefore, expose it again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with all your strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it is healed, then good; and if not, then know that the corruption is in a distant depth of the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, you have no skill in it, except to leave it to nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If a small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, extract it with thin forceps suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If, however, there are many bones, then carefully extract all of them, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If, however, some moisture creates an obstacle for you, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those moistures and flesh, if there are any there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If, however, you are not prepared to remove the bones from your time, then place over the wound that which will cause it to fester; and leave it, until that which is surrounding those bones from the flesh and moistures festers.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And constrict the section which you have cut in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a cloth soaked in ground sulfur with oil; or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other green ointments.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those moistures, namely, fester, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is made easier.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg, or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupt from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however that which is corrupt in it is a large part, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and to cut it all the way to the place where the corruption has reached: then treat it until it is consolidated.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I relate to you the case of a man in his leg, so that you may set it as an example and assistance for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his leg, from a cause that arose within his body, that is, from the interior, until the matters reached the leg, and it became greatly inflamed: and there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, time passed with the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many matters rushed in with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until the leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; all of which discharged pus and bodily humours.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for about two years, and there was no wise practitioner of the manual art among them, until I was called, and saw his leg and the matters that flowed from those openings with great force; even the entire body of the man was already decaying, and his complexion was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, I inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings, and found that they reached each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I then hastened and cut over one of those openings until I uncovered part of the bone; and I found it corrupted; already corroded, and blackened, and rotten, and perforated, until it had penetrated down to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore removed what was exposed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption which I cut away and removed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already eradicated it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried, and I found a second layer of bone above the first layer: and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I cut away what appeared to me also to be from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its restoration.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Therefore, I probed it again, and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and to attempt its restoration: and it was not restored, until I cut approximately a palm's breadth from the bone, and removed it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with medicines, and it quickly consolidated and healed: and this repetition in its operation and section was not necessary, except on account of the weakened state of the infirm person, and their scant tolerance, and my fear for them of death; since it happened to them at all hours, due to an excess of evacuations, from ill syncopes.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore, they were healed with complete recovery: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good condition was established in their body, and their strength returned: and they returned to their normal state: and walking caused them no harm at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If, however, a projecting bone in the body has already been fractured, then it is necessary to saw it, according to this method: and it is to take a bandage, and to tighten it on the end of the protruding bone; and to order someone to extend it upwards; and to place another bandage of thicker wool on the first bandage.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone; and extend its end, so as to draw the flesh downwards; and you uncover the flesh over the place that you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place wood, or a board, properly beneath the bone below; for when you do this, it does not prevent you from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone; and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and forces a sawing of it another time.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	If the bone is corrupted, and is not protruding, but rather its part is continuous with another part, and the corruption is in its middle, or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Afterwards saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continuous from the other part; and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption for a short while, as we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it is continuous on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no remedy in it except abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or in the finger of the foot: then the matter in it is very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But you must investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever remedy rectifies itself for you: when it does not cause you opposition from a vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many incisions and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have long study with you.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the ways of illnesses; for then you will find for yourself what is appropriate to it from instruments for every sickness.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am firmly establishing for you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments, which you will set as examples upon which you will cut, and the proof by which you will test others.
Forma Serrae.	Saw shape.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Shape of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This saw shape depicted, should be made properly.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arch be of sharpness from iron; and its handle of boxwood, and let it be a pyramidally well-made one.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Shape of the razors' joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be, according to the shape of a star-shaped nail's head; and let its points be according to the shape of the points of an elischetfegi.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they become corrupted, or the bone is large and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Shape of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Shape of the middle razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Shape of the broad razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Shape of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Shape of the other, slender razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Shape of the other razor with a curved end.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Shape of a small, slender, taut razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Shape of the razor with which bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Shape of a large razor also.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is similar to a saw, and the end is like a saw: it is shown in many places by the cutting of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	Shape of the razor suitable for the cutting of that which is perforated in bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is triangular, with sharp points.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of Indian material.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, all that we have said concerning razors, and chisels, and saws should be done.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	Concerning the incision of extremities, and the sawing of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	Therefore, if you have treated that corruption with medicinal remedies, and the treatment does not help, and you see the corruption extending into the limb, to which nothing reacts: then it is necessary to cut that limb, to the point where the corruption reaches, so that it escapes from death or from the greater harm that is caused by the loss of the limb.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it smells foul: as if fire had burned it, or it rots after the blackness; until that rot is cut into, reaching the limb itself, and creeps throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, hasten with its incision, and likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain poisonous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and rattlesnake, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If, therefore, the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise, if it happens in the hand, then cut it off at the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption, until it reaches the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however the corruption passes, and you see it approximately at the elbow, then in that is the death of the sick person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that from treatment, is a matter of skill.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades a toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches the sole of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	If however it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no remedy in it, except for release, and leaving the sick person to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the method of cutting or sawing off a limb is to tie the ligament below the one you wish to cut, and tie another ligament above the spot.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And let the attendant stretch one ligament downwards, and let the attendant stretch the other ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a broad spatula until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut or sawn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you place linen cloth on all sides, and that the saw not touch a healthy part; and that the sick person suffer added injury, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	If, however, an internal bleeding occurs while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or put some powders that stop the bleeding upon it.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medication, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a bandage suitable to it, and care for it until it is healed.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that it happened to a man in his foot, this same happening that I tell you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened in his foot with a blackness, with a burn resembling the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore, the man hastened from himself, after he saw the corruption fall upon the limb with its intensity, which he found from its pain and burning: and it fell upon him at the joint, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time passed, that same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore, he came to me, and I attempted to recover that superfluity with what I placed upon his hand from medicines after the purification of his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping from me upon the repulsion of that superfluity: and I also feared for him at the incision of his hand death.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's strength was over the fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Therefore, after he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it came to me concerning him, that he hastened and cut his entire hand: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I have not brought forth this narration, except that it may be a help concerning that which falls from the kind of this sickness: and that it may be a signification by which it may be signified, and according to which it may be done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	Concerning the treatment of Sinuses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess is prolonged, until it forms a collection of pus: then it breaks, or is pierced, and that which is in it of pus comes out, and a hollow place remains as if it were a vessel: and the skin which is over it is like a cloth which has now become thin: and it does not reach its final stage of corruption, nor does it affect the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus; and it is not called a Fistula: but if its space is prolonged, until the corruption affects any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its treatment is to cut that entire skin as it rolls back, and especially when it is thin and made like a cloth; and you are confident that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that final consequence; and if there is thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster; and it is, that you consider the Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then, if it is large, and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be mixed in a vessel; and let them be boiled over the fire, until the medicine reddens; and it becomes the thickness of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need, and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it; and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the Sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is, that you take the ashes of vine wood, or the ashes from the trees of the holly, and pour water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the Sinus is now washed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the sick person does not tolerate Egyptian medicine, nor ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clysterize him with honey and wine mixed, since the property of honey is to cleanse and wash; and wine causes the sinus to adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this repeatedly, and are confident that the corruption of the Sinus is now removed, then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow there.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is to take from the dyafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clysterize him with some medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the Sinus is constricted, so that the clyster tube does not fit: then enlarge it a little with iron; or place in it a linen cloth wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basil ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the opening is also wide, then bring together its lips with suture; and leave in it a quantity into which a clyster may enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the opening from which pus runs is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place which is in it, so that pus runs from it downwards; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the Sinus, it prevents flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to cut the Sinus approximately below the place you want, then try to prepare the limb in such a way that pus runs from it with ease, as is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to prevent any pus from remaining in it; and take strengthening medicines that are placed on the wound, suitable to what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And spread them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the cloth be of such a size that it covers the entire Sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with scissors a hole in the direction of the Sinus opening, slightly larger than the Sinus opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then spread gentle ointments over another cloth, according to the size of the hole; and place it over the first, at a distance from the Sinus opening, so that the pus may be discharged more easily from it; and do not remove the large cloth, except after some days at a time.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from pus may exit; and so that you may know whether the matter running from it, is much or little; or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And with this again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether its master feels pain in it, or whether there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, when your treatment proceeds in this way, and you see the matter that exits from the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering or is approaching adherence; then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you dissolve the wound, then replace the cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	However, if thin matter exits from the Sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is near, because there are people whose flesh generation is slow in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	However, if undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If, therefore, the adherence of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying of the medicines, but let the physicians make them, so that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their power, such as the dyafinicon ointment, when superfluity of addition from zegi is added to it.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last remedies used for treatment, is to take dyafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle upon it old wine, equal in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it now does a similar action to this, when you do not have dyafinicon ointment present, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and aloe, and frankincense: grind the whole, and powder it over honey while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then line a cloth with it, and bind it over the sinus; and line with the honey you boiled, until it thickened; and powder spices over it, and place over the cloth, and bind it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes long aristolochia, and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily, and the herb flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them, simple or mixed, grind them, and sieve them: and powder them over the honey I spoke of, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the sinus condition persists and is not cured by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments; then treat it with the treatment of fistulas, as was previously described.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Concerning the treatment of whitlow, and of a worn-down nail, and the incision of a grafted finger, and of the section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter XCI.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	A whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot; and perhaps it arises on the other fingers.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	Therefore, when its condition prolongs itself, and its treatment is neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess, or it becomes corrupted and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrupts the whole of it, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul odor; and the end of the finger becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	Therefore, when you treat it, with what we have said in division, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut with an iron the entire excess that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cautery is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If however the bone is sound, and the nail also healthy, and the empty additions of the nail now press the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin radium under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards; and cut the flesh with ease, and put on that which remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments, until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, corruption has already impressed itself upon the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and extract it, for it will never be healed while corrupt bone remains within.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see corrosion and corruption advancing into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to the preceding description of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, there is abrasion or impact of the nail, and a severe pain occurs, then it is necessary to first bleed the weak person.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula in a transverse cut from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause severe pain to the afflicted person by that, and it will be a cause of added flesh growing in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then treat the place with that which soothes the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The extra finger, which is born in some people's hands, is perhaps entirely fleshy, or perhaps contains bones in some of them, and perhaps a nail is on it. And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their origin is in some of the finger's knots.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, the one that arises in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that arises at the joint of the finger perhaps does move.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, to cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But the treatment of the one whose origin is in the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In the one, however, that is born on the finger at the last of the nodes, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	The consolidation that occurs between the fingers often happens either by the nature of the human being, that is, it is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place linen strips or cloths soaked in rose oil between them, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them: or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the place is consolidated as it ought to be.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	Concerning the incision of a defect.
Caput XCII.	Chapter Ninety-two.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Ulcers are veins wrapped, thick, full of melancholic superfluities which occur in many members of the body: and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those traveling and working, and carrying burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to administer a shaking of the body from black bile, sometimes with a forceful shaking.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, the patient's veins should be opened.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they should be cut, and the black blood drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And the other method is that the vein should be raised, and the entire one drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, its incision is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, soak the leg in much hot water until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of his thigh, down to the lower part of the knee, with a bandage.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then raise, that is, draw the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg, up to the top, and from the top, it is necessary that the phlebotomist first attend the patient.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then cut the nail until further down: until there issues forth from the blood a quantity which you see sufficient, and which the strength of the patient tolerates.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards tie it: and order him to abstain from foods generating black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy, when the veins are filled, and that harms the patient.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	Its elevation, however, is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the patient, if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce him into a bath: or embrocate his leg with hot water, until it turns red, and the veins are prominent: or let him exercise with vigorous exertion, if a bath is not available to him, until the limb is warmed.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then cut the skin in a straight line along the vein's section: either at its last point near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it appears to the senses: and at its appearance, you will see it sloping from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it thus emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce a probe under it, until when it is lifted and emerges from the skin: suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then cut another section near that section by three fingers' breadth.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then lift it with the probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then cut another section, or several sections, if you need them.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then lift, and cut it at the very last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do that until you pull it out of the section which is higher, or higher than all the sections, until the whole thing comes out: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	However, if it does not yield to you for pulling and lifting, then insert an awl with a strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod beneath it, and revolve your hand in every direction until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And be careful not to cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and a harmful injury enters upon the weak from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When therefore you have pulled it out completely, then put on the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil, or oil; and treat it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is an involvement to the parts, and is not as we have said in a straight manner: then it is necessary to cut into it on every part of its twisting, and its places of involvement.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with hooks, until you lift it all: and be careful at your incision on it not to cut a vein, or wound: for it will be difficult for you to lift, or to extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form of the incident by which the vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of the blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have a curvature like the other hooks, nor a sharp end, so as not to wound a vein: and it is of a thick, smooth bend, because if it were slender, it would cut a vein by its thinness: indeed, superfluous thickness is in it, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is produced in legs in hot lands, such as the Alizegi and the land of the Arabs, and in arid, hot lands, few in tenderness, that is, in which neither grass nor tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is produced in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's occurrence is that a violent inflammation happens in the leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the place becomes blistered.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, then it is necessary to wrap a piece of lead, whose weight is from one drachma to two drachmas, around it and tie it: and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever anything emerges from it to the exterior, wrap that in lead and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it extends a great deal, then cut off a portion of it, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it off at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it must be gently treated and pulled out gradually, until the last part emerges, and nothing remains of it in the body; and from this vein, in some men, it emerges to a length of five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has come to my knowledge that it emerged from a man to a length of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	However, if it is cut during your time of treatment, then introduce a rod into its opening, and pierce it with a long hole, along with its body, until all the material within is evacuated; and treat the putrefaction of the place with remedies for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and many openings occur in it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, treat it, as we said in the division, and with what was previously stated.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in a certain land among us the Cattle Disease; because it often happens to cattle, and is a small single worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes through the whole body, ascending and descending; and its passage from limb to limb is shown to the senses, until it bursts a place in the skin wherever it bursts, and emerges.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humours.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	Just as worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and threadworms, happen in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared because of its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it travels in the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it bursts there, and emerges, and destroys the eye: and that happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	Therefore, when you wish to cure it and extract it, then it is not done except at its wandering and its appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore it is necessary to bind that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong constricting bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then apply a cautery with fire to the place, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If however you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then bind below it the eyebrow with a good constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above it, and extract it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person use the cleansing of his body, with medicines that dissolve bad, putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	Concerning the incision above the ailment Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter XCV.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have already seen it, as I relate to you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was summoned to a woman ill in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I stayed an hour, I saw one swelling move with a quiver, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it is like quicksilver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore, the pain receded from that place, and settled in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of the body, until it reached the other arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was revolving throughout her whole body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its change from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, before that I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a manner.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who find pain changing from limb to limb, and I did not see it with my eyes, as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think it is anything other than because she was one of those who are from the dry lands, with detected veins:  therefore, that windiness appears changing to the senses.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When, therefore, you wish to cure it, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to you by sight, as we said, then compress above it and below it quickly, and cut above it until that constrained windiness exits, and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it with shaking the body, and with things that expel winds, and soothe them with foul pills, and pills of serpent, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Concerning the extraction of Arrows.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter XCVI.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows are diversified according to their types and according to the locations in which they strike the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	Their diversity is indeed such, because among them are those which have large points, and small ones: and concave ones, and blunt ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those with tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those with stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to the limbs on which they fall are in two ways.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For the members are either from the principal hollow members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and the like of these.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and the signs of death appear to you, which I tell you afterwards, then you should avoid extracting the arrow from them, for death follows it in whoever it is in, in many situations.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and emerges through the membrane that is above the brain, are: because violent headaches, and blindness, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of bile occur from it.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood emerges from the nostrils, or the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And a white moisture like gruel emerges from the place of the wound.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And from it exits something similar to the watery part of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not emerge.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	However, the signs of an arrow when it strikes the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that one feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in an empty thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know therefore, that death descends without a doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the outflow of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck become inflamed, and the sick person's colour changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he exhales a large, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow strikes the covering in the chest, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great gasping with violent pain, with a sigh; and all the members of the shoulders move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps undigested food will emerge from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and is fixed in it, something of the excrement, or a piece of the zirbum, or an already ruptured intestine, emerges from the wound.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine emerges, and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger than the weakness, then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	However, the other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder blade, arm, the vertebrae of the back, the collarbone, hip, leg, and similar limbs are saved in various ways, when the arrow does not strike an artery or nerve and is not poisoned.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, so that you may signify it in your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I obtained nothing from it but a small extremity, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the bows of the Turks, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no bad accident happened to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is the one which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I cut above it between the two guides; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore, I worked on it carefully until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed concerning his condition, I cut above the arrow; and I worked on it, and I extracted it; and he was healed, and no misfortune happened to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound had healed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore seven years had passed, an arrow emerged at the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman on whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound had healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her; and no change occurred in her condition, and the woman experienced no harm in any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, on whose face an arrow had fallen: and the wound healed, and it remained, causing him not much pain; and many similar cases to these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I extracted an arrow from a man of the king's leading men, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and had already inclined slightly to the right side: and the arrow was entirely concealed.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore summoned for his treatment after the arrow's impact up to three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I therefore found the arrow wound to be very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore searched for it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and indeed he was finding a prick and pain beneath his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that that prick was from the arrow's tip.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore plastered the area with a plaster having attractive and digestive power, trusting in myself that the area would become an abscess, and that a sign of the arrow would appear for me to cut upon it: and no event occurred in the area signifying that the arrow had reached the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore applied the plaster to it for many days: and no event occurred, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained weak from its extraction for a space of days, until on a certain day he felt the arrow within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he recounted it to me.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened; and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead became visibly apparent to us; and about four months passed with him during this time.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to extraction, I did not cease to refine and devise methods for it, until on a certain day I began to use suitably crafted forceps, in the manner that their form will be described at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the infirm man was healed with complete health; and nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I narrate to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows: so that you may place that as a rule and signification upon that which I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not encompassed with the narrative, nor does the book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares little things to much, and the present to the absent, and discovers a new operation and a new instrument in the descent of the foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by extraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite of another part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which emerges from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place, and is drawn out, and emerges.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not yield to exit at the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary that you leave it for several days, until the flesh that is around it rots, and its extraction and emergence are eased.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And similarly, if it is fixed in the bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for several days, and repeatedly remove it with extraction and movement every day, until it emerges.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary that you pierce the surroundings of the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's path is widened.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it out and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already penetrated one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents that I have described appear in the weak person, then refrain from removing the arrow, and leave it, until its condition is equalized after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate as far as the sifach; and the weak person remains for several days, and nothing of those accidents happens to him; then proceed with removing the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however it is very firmly fixed, and does not yield to removal: then administer a drill around the arrow, as I have shown you: then treat the area until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however the arrow is now hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then remove it with certain instruments that are suitable for its extraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however you cannot remove it, due to the constriction of the wound, and due to the arrow's length deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then enlarge it above it, until the wound is widened, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If however it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, by every means you can, and if means, if the flesh cannot escape from the fracture of the ears, and their twisting, until it escapes.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps to all sides, until you cause it to escape: and use the finest precision, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it within one hour, then leave it for several days, until those things surrounding it have rotted.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try again; for it will then be easier.  But if a contrary flow of blood hinders you, then use what we have stated in the healing chapter, and preserve your skill from the incision of a vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use every means possible to extract the arrow; and let it be with ease and calmness, or with slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary, when you pull the arrow, that the patient be positioned according to the manner in which the arrow was lodged.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Because this is more helpful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If, however, this is not possible for you, then use what is possible for you from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	However, if an arrow emerges from the opposite side, or if something from it is already coming out externally; or if the arrowhead causes a swelling on the skin near the upper part, and you see it protruding; cut over it, and let the incision be according to the amount that the forceps can grip.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out; for it will then become easy to extract.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If, however, it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is pressed into the bone and widens its way out; then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow's shaft is in it, then drive it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If, however, the shaft has fallen off and you wish to administer an impulse, then introduce a concave instrument, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then drive it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is hollow, then drive it out with an instrument entering it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then treat it with whatever is suitable for it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or belly, or bladder, or side; and is close to the point you are touching with your probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and be cautious of cutting a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And many types are made from them, large, small, and medium, according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the width and constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the driving force is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And the shape of the dull driver.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the blunt end, like a ray, so that its entrance into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be driven with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The end of this concave driver is concave, like a bird's feather, so that the arrow's entry into it and its impetus may be eased.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	Concerning the phlebotomy of veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter XCVII.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins to be opened, whose use runs through the body, are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which appear in the two temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called the Lookers; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	And these are the veins called Algecherich.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the head vein.
Et Fusca.	And the Fusca.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And is the Middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the Basilic, and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And the Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called the Itching vein.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	And the common people call it the belly vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And the arm cord, and it is placed above the fold: and it is that in which bloodletting is done, and it is that which appears above the thumb with clear manifestation.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And the Salvatella: and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and in the foot there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is that which is under the curve of the thumb on the wild side.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second is the Saphena: and its place is at the heel on the domestic side.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel on the wild side.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the other leg there are three veins similar to those.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and for hemicrania, and for sahafati, and for old, bad head ulcers.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the phlebotomy of it is according to what I relate.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is done that the patient's head is shaved, and his nape is rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, a good rubbing.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage until the two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in the two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark that spot with ink.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take the phlebotomy knife, and it is called the incider.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then introduce it under the vein in the skin until the phlebotomous reaches the mouth.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then elevate your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incident incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or about that: and make as much blood come out as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with bandages, and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit in principio libri incisio earum, et ipsarum cauterizatio.	And already in the beginning of the book there was incision of them and cauterization of them.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum Arteriarum in timporibus.	Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
Duarum uero Arteriarum quae sunt in duobus timporibus phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad hemigraneam antiquam: et sodam prauam, et obtalmiam assiduam: et cursum superfluitatum effusarum acutarum ad oculos.	The phlebotomy of the two arteries which are in the two temples is a help for old hemiplegia, and crooked neck, and persistent ophthalmia, and excessive flow of acute tears to the eyes.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est secundum quod narro tibi.	And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Stringat infirmus collum suum multum, donec appareant duae uenae sensui apparitione manifesta: et demonstretur pulsus earum sub digito tuo.	Let the infirm person greatly strain his neck, until two veins become clearly apparent to the senses; and let their pulse be demonstrated beneath your finger.
Tunc enim signa cum encaustro.	Then mark the spots with ink.
Deinde eleua cutem desuper uenam ad superiora cum digito tuo indice, et intromitte phlebotomum incidentem desubtus, et eleua uenam ad superiora.	Then lift the skin above the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet cutting underneath, and lift the vein upwards.
Et incide eam, sicut fecisti in duabus uenis aliis: et fac currere ex sanguine secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And cut it, just as you did in the other two veins: and make the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde solue coartationem infirmi, et pone digitum tuum super uenam hora una.	Then loosen the constriction of the infirm person, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Postea pone super ipsam cotum et puluillos, et stringe ipsum desuper constrictione forti: et dimitte ipsam, donec sanetur.	Afterwards place a bandage and pads over it, and bind it tightly above the constriction: and leave it until it heals.
Et iam praecessit rememoratio earum, et ipsarum incisio, et earum extractio in principio libri.	And already the recollection of them, and their incision, and their extraction are in the beginning of the book.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it is opened with a wide phlebotome.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it should not be a phlebotome with a sharp tip, like the other phlebotomes, but rather one with a broad tip.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	And lance it across, because the bone is near, and perhaps the phlebotome will break in it when it is slender.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	Concerning the lancing of the veins in the two tear ducts.

Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	Because the vein is not apparent to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and make the blood flow according to your need.

Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	For it will quickly heal.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	About the phlebotomy of the veins of Guidegi.
Duarum uero Guidegi phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad constrictionem anhelitus, et incaeptionem leprae, et aegritudines melancholicas, et impetiginem et ulcera mala, et corrodentibus, id est, herpetibus estiomenis.	The phlebotomy of the two veins of Guidegi is helpful for the constriction of breathing, and the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and those that gnaw, that is, shingles.

¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	Concerning the phlebotomy of veins, Algeberich.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	Veins, according to Algeberich, are a help in phlebotomy, because they contribute to the removal of swelling in the mouth, and to the corruption of the gums; and to bad ulcers; and to the fissures of the lips, and to bad ulcers, even those that are on the nose and around it.

Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	Therefore, cut each with a single incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger of them, and the more evident of them.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	And similarly do with the two veins which are in the upper lip: and indeed the custom runs most with it; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after phlebotomy of the cephalic veins.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	However, the benefit of phlebotomy of the two veins that are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocations that are in the throat, and the illness of the uvula, and the illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomizing those is such that the sick person sits between your hands before the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it a vein, and on the other side of it a vein; and the color of both is sloping to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	Therefore phlebotomize each; and beware that you do not put your hand in the last stages of phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood will occur from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those in whose phlebotomy custom has run in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle phlebotomize: or olive to the subtlety of the slope: or by cutting with a knife phlebotomize, and it is Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is, what is suitable for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are species broad, and subtle according to the wideness of the veins and their constriction. The form of the myrtle phlebotomize be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotom is of less width, and more subtle extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	Of the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is a help in phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses of the throat and neck, from there following to the chest and abdomen; and it befits the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be above fear from it, for beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore, if he errs, and adds to the phlebotomy puncture, he will cut that artery, and a flood of blood will result.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore, it is necessary that one not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy-piercing instrument; rather, one should cut it with an Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary that one seek another, or substitute for it another, or seek a branch of it; or one should phlebotomize the brachial vein instead.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is manifest, and cut it with the phlebotomy Anesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If, however, you wish to phlebotomize that same one, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the spot until you know the location of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the spot with ink, afterward the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision with a phlebotomy Alnesil, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And be careful that the blow does not fall within the space from the location of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tighten the ligature, an inflation in the place you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore, avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood at the phlebotomy leap, like a child's urine, and it is thin blood, red: then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then quickly place your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then tighten the arm, and release it; and let the sick person beware of its movement; and let it be upon his fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	If however the blood is not cut off, and overcomes you; and there is no medicine present to you at your moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of fig bark, and split it; take one half, and bind it over the place of the vein's constriction in a fitting manner, with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not, then treat it with what preceded concerning the place of powders that cut off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	The phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalic vein, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it befits the phlebotomist that it be above fear from his phlebotomy, for a nerve is beneath it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore the phlebotomist adds in puncturing, and finds a nerve, there occurs numbness in it, and its healing becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and is not shown: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize it, a section with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If however the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Concerning the cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomies of the cephalic vein are helpful, because they draw blood from the head, and contribute to illnesses of the eyes.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by puncturing with an olive-wood phlebotome, or with a myrtle-wood phlebotome: because it is safer than all the veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it befits you in phlebotomy to avoid with the phlebotome the head of the biceps only, and to seek a gentler place; and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first stroke, so that it may be repeated on it with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, perhaps it becomes abscessed in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first stroke, but that abscess does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	Concerning the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents resulting from it, in whose correction you should consider.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First, therefore, it is something you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution against the onset of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely, the Cephalic, and the Fusca, and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy be performed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring, and in summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And phlebotomy be performed on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed of the day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a set time; but when the appropriateness and necessity for it arise, at night, or by day, and at every hour, and at every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that children be bled until they reach fourteen years.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, unless from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should the elderly be bled who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels beforehand with a gentle clyster, if there is a great deal of retained feces in them, so that the veins during the bleeding do not draw out putrid impurities harmful to the major limbs from the bowels.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient be bled who has a toctina, that is, a sickness of satiety, nor the drunkard, nor someone recovering from drunkenness, until that is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor the sick with dropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And bleeding should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, and excessive sexual activity, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, and anything that dissolves strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks, and medications: if it is possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him: or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood is made thinner.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and endeavor that his chest be evacuated that day from all evil animal accidents: such as anguish, and anger, and fear: and from all bodily accidents, such as labor, and pain, and excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him have present in his seat things with whose use the custom of men has run from aroma, and odor, and rejoicing, and things similar to them, to the extent possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion which is higher than the cushion of the phlebotomist; afterward let him draw his arm out, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice, or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then tie the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the constriction be moderate, because when constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, it then hinders the course of the blood; or in relaxation, it then also hinders the course of the blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins inflate and are evident to the senses.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his left index finger slightly over the vein itself, under the place where he wants to phlebotomize, so that the vein does not move away and the blow is not missed.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because there are veins which, like a fleeing chord in phlebotomy, and there are those which are full of airiness; and when you place the phlebotom knife upon them, they contract beneath the phlebotom knife, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and the phlebotom knife does not open the vein; and if it does open it, it is narrow.  Therefore it is necessary for the phlebotomist to be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should lay down the phlebotom knife.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore the vein is opened at the first attempt, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat it another time under that spot a little, or above it quickly, if the place is not already inflamed.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it becomes inflamed, or the patient trembles, then leave him alone for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	For perhaps it will draw the inflammation.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor let him enter a bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him repeat phlebotomy, if he wishes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that not the amount of blood you desire will issue forth, then repeat the phlebotomy in the very aperture itself along the correct path, and add a little in the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this quickly, before the place becomes inflamed, for an inflamed place is in many men at a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If, therefore, you see it already inflamed, then do not repeat on it at all, for it will not excuse anything for you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place upon it something from the dregs of oil, for it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, whereby you phlebotomize veins against the prohibition of blood flow: and they do this, the *tyriaca alfarach* and *sagzenea*, when placed from one of them upon the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood is made thinner and resolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If a large abscess occurs at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist except in that instance, or the vein opening is small, then quickly place on the area a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and bind it for one hour: for it is resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of blood from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If some blackness or greenness remains at the site after a few days, it does no harm: and if you wish, place something of aloe, or dissolved myrrh, or something from the juice of mint, that is, of balm or similar to it, upon it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And very often abscesses and swellings occur at phlebotomy of the Basilica vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon compression with your hand upon it, that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, be careful to place something upon it of that which we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood of the artery will flow from it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster for it with that in which there is astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary that you extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of its strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red; and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes thin; and similarly if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one instance, that the phlebotomy of the vein be broadened, and that the phlebotomist be wide; and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary that he extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow; and better that which is administered in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of bloodletting is safe from a flow of blood, and from the incision of a nerve; and is more praiseworthy, and safer than bloodletting by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is accustomed to come near to fainting in phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before the phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate water; or secaniabin, if it is warmed; and extract from his blood in three or four stages.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before the bloodletting bread soaked in mulse syrup, or in a syrup of aromatized honey with spices, or in a fragrant aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If fainting occurs during bloodletting, and the cause of it is the excessive outflow of blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and let him use aromatics with althea, and let his chest be lined with it; and let him use the rest of what we said in the division in the chapter on fainting from evacuation.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	Whoever wishes to purge their arm and release their blood a second time, it is necessary for one whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to release the blood gradually according to the measure of strength over consecutive days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	Whoever wishes to purge their arm and release their blood a second time, and their body is strong, then let them do so after seven or nine hours from their first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	Whoever wishes to draw blood from their body to the opposite part to which it inclines, it is necessary for them to be purged on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In whose body, however, there is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causing fever, it is necessary that blood depart from it in one instance, and that a large quantity be drawn out of it; and the opening be enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of bloodletting; and so that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For often that happens, when the bloodletter is unaware and negligence occurs.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary, when wishing to purge an arm and release blood a second time, when the vein's opening is already closed and the blood's exit is difficult, to press upon it with force, and quickly bend or extend it.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is very harmful; indeed, leave it alone until it is bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with sharpness the blood clot from the vein's opening, and place upon it some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place upon it something from the tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and apply gentle pressure, until blood emerges.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If however the vein is already inflamed, then leave it and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If necessity compels you to release the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed it above that spot, or in another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the arm's vein should be bled at the place of the Cephalic and Basilic veins, if they are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the bloodletting is such that the weak person should immerse their hand in warm water until the skin reddens and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then, a ligature should be tightened over it with moderate constriction.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then, bleed along the vein's cross-section gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise: and let the opening be wide, and your bloodletting should be above the wrist joint for a short while.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the flow of blood is hindered, then again immerse the hand in warm water, and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your desired result.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	However, if you are during the days of summer, then you may excuse yourself from re-immersion of the hand in warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the flow of blood is greatly facilitated in warm water during the winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And bloodletting from this vein is safer than all veins, because there is no pulse or nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Bloodletting from the Saluatella vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of its bloodletting is such that you should grasp the vein of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells and is clearly visible.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, the phlebotomist should cut across it.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And be careful not to injure your hand with the lancet.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For beneath it are the nerves of the fingers laid bare of flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then, return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood coagulates in the opening of the vein, and is prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When therefore you have drawn out the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not quickly solidify.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly it is necessary to do with every constricted branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	However, the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen; and similarly do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The benefit of saphenous vein phlebotomy is for illnesses located in the lower part of the body, such as uterine ailments, and retention of menses, and kidney ailments, and old sores of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the method of phlebotomy for it is that the patient put their foot into warm water: and make friction upon it until the veins protrude: and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And indeed the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and branches from it into many branches on the front of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its aggregation, because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you phlebotomize it on the front of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the front of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy instrument so that you phlebotomize it across, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If, however, the flow of blood is obstructed, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If the phlebotomist errs in the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the location is safe, and you have no fear of harm from it, when you are wary of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly with the Saphena of the other foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the wild side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the relief of phlebotomy is for the pain of the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and he should bind his leg from the side of the ankle up to above the heel by four fingers, with a long thin strip; for it does not appear except on that account.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	Therefore, when it appears, then the phlebotomist should open it according to whatever method is possible for you, or by transverse incision; and it is better either to cut it by incision, or to divide it by section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If, however, you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all, then the phlebotomist should open any branch of it, and that one which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the ear: and beware of the nerves, and make the blood run as much as you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the binding, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and bind the location.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Concerning Cupping, and the nature of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Cupping instruments are made of horns, and of air, and of glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With scarification, and the extraction of blood: and the other is cupping without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Or indeed it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And cuppings which are administered with scarification and blood extraction are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is, the cupping of the Alnocrati, and it is behind the head; and Alkehel, and it is the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of the Alhagdahim, and they are two blades of the neck at two sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is under the jaw at the lower mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of the Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And cupping indeed does not extract blood from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no strength is lost from them, as happens with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered in any illness resulting from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity prompts cupping from illness or custom, we administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	This is because there are men who, when blood multiplies within them to the point of needing extraction by cupping, find heaviness and throbbing in their head.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And among them is one who scratches the site of their cupping.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue becomes suppurated, and expels blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And among them is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And among them is one who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and slain ones, and wounds, and things similar to those.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore, when we see something like this, and especially if it is in the third middle part of the month, we then order that a wind-drawing procedure be carried out after two or three hours have passed during the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The benefit of neck cupping is that it contributes to the heaviness in the head and that which flows to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it is necessary that it be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this cupping is in the place of a head-vein bloodletting.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not permissible for one of cold temperament, or one with a cold, to use it.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore, the elderly and those with cold ailments of the head should not use it.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But if one is frequently exposed to it, forgetfulness is produced in him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore, you should instruct the wind-sucker to lower his hand somewhat with the wind-sucker, fearing the production of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Wind-suction, or Alkehel, is in place of the dark vein-opening and the basilica vein-opening, and therefore it is beneficial for asthma, and constriction of breathing, and fracture of the breathing instrument, and cough, and fullness.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the Alkehel wind-sucker be moved somewhat, because if it is placed lower, it creates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Wind-suction, however, of the alhagdahim, is beneficial for accidental pains in the head, and for ophthalmia, and for hemicrania, and for perforation, and for pain in the tooth roots: and it is in place of the basilica vein-opening.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-sucker not to press his hand with the scarification, so that he does not strike an artery and blood flow occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Wind-suction under the chin, however, is beneficial for sores in the mouth, and for gum corruption, and for similar ailments which are in the mouth: and it stands in place of the other vein-openings, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Wind-suction of the spatulas, however, is beneficial for alchafacham, which comes about from reflex and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Wind-suction, however, of the interior parts of the two foci, is beneficial to the vein-opening of the three veins, Basilica, Fusca, and Cephalica: because it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh, and those small veins draw from other larger veins until the drawing reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-sucker not to proceed too much in the scarification, because the place is denuded of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	A cupping vessel, however, that is cupped over the alchausos, is beneficial for hemorrhoids of the anus, and for lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you instruct the wind-sucker to use a large cupping vessel, and that it be made of air, because the place needs strong suction, and perhaps the delicate cupping vessels are broken: and a large scarification should be made.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Cupping of the legs, however, diminishes markedly, because they draw blood from the whole body, and benefit old pains in the kidneys, and wombs, and bladder; they induce menstruation, and are beneficial for botor and ademenul; and they stand in the place of bloodletting of the two saphenous veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of the alhorcobeni cupping is close to the benefit of cupping the two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of placing the cupping vessels is that you should first place a vacuum cupping, and draw with moderate suction; and do not prolong the position of the cupping vessels, but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the place with an equal arrival; and do not cease to repeat this and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and the redness of blood appears; then therefore scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For whoever is of tender flesh, of rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once, no more, so that the place is not ulcerated.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the cupper to enlarge the scarification a little, and to deepen it a little; and to temper the suction in ease, speed, and smooth movement.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is thickness in the blood, then it is necessary that you scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first instance, the path is opened to the thinning of the blood and its becoming watery; and in the second, to the meticulous scrutiny of extracting the thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If truly the blood is very foul, then let the scarification be done a third time, so that the final result is achieved.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we wish to extract blood gradually, or a little bit, one scarification suffices for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we wish to extract much blood, we scarify with many scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that it be scarified with a deep scarification, and the equal measure in scarification is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which ought to be administered from oils at the position of Cupping, and what the cupper should beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the places to be cupped with opening, softening, and dissolving oils: if it is in the summer time, such as the oil of alkeiri, or bruised oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the wintertime, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or camomile oil, or sarbantine oil, and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If however the superfluity is thick, cold: then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balsam oil, or white oil, or dill oil, and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If however the cupper has large pores, tender flesh: then it is necessary that he refrain from oil, and it is necessary that these wash the places of the cupping after cupping with rosewater, or with cold water, or with soothing water, or with pumpkin water, or with purslane water, and similar ones to them.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	However, he whose blood is of much moisture, should wash the cuppings with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumac, and similar ones to them.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	However, whose superfluities are thick, let him wash his cuppings with old wine, or with water of sorrel, or with a decoction of dill, or camomile, and similar to them.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that cupping be avoided in a bath, or in the vicinity of a bath, indeed it is necessary that it be administered after leaving the bath by an hour, or by two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary that anyone sleep after cupping.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that cupping or bloodletting ought to be governed by before cupping?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after it, it is necessary to consider first: then if the cupped or blood-let individual be choleric, and sharpness and inflammation overcome his blood: then it is necessary that he take things that cool, such as pomegranate, and also endive with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and iuleb, and things similar to these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And place his food poultry, and mutton sekebiget, and foods seasoned with wild fruit, and things similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that he take in drink a syrup of honey, or of almiua, or alsecaniabin made from seeds, and that he take medium fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and it is prescribed that he use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And place his food poultry, and hempseed, and sparrows, that is, small birds, and young pigeons issiadebet.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink on the day of cupping and bloodletting be more than the food, and it is necessary that in some men be given in the drink at the hours a tyriaca alfaroch, or a medicine of musk, that is, musk, or alesselithe before cupping, and before bloodletting, or after: in order that the principal members may be strengthened and the blood may be refined.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary that they take it in heated drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Concerning cupping without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, cupping without scarification are cupping which are placed upon the liver, and the spleen, and gout, and upon the abdomen, the navel, and the regions of the kidneys, and the chest of the hip: because these members do not tolerate scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And they are not sought out unless either the attachment of blood from a member to a member: as we place a cupping upon the breasts in the sickness of a flux of blood from the nostrils.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to resolve cold, viscous windiness in a member: such as we place a cupping on the belly, and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it indeed rarefies the member, and heats it, and removes pain on account of this, because it resolved that windiness.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	It is also placed upon the kidneys, when obstruction occurs in them, or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For by its virtue of attraction perhaps it opens the obstruction, or eradicates the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when placed upon the liver and spleen, concerning troublesome windiness in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these cupping glasses are administered empty with only incision.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in cases of pleurisy; and that is, that the cupping glass be filled, and be large, with warm water alone, or water in which herbs suitable for it have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Form of cupping glass administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be that of two open fingers, according to what we have formed: and let its depth be half a palm: and let there be a small hole on its side, approximately in its midpoint, for the needle to enter: let it be made of bronze or brass, with thick, smooth, equal, and polished edges, so that it does not harm the limb where it is placed upon it: and let there be a cross-shaped rod of bronze or iron in its center where the candle with fire is placed.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And now this cupping glass is made large, larger than we have described, and slightly smaller than that, according to the illness and the age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the cupping glasses of children and those who are thin are different from the cupping glasses of men and those with large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is as follows: light a wick with fire made of flax or a small candle of wax, and place it over the middle of the cross-shaped rod in the center of the cupping glass, so that the fire is positioned approximately at the lower part of the cupping glass, so that the patient's body is not burned.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is placed on the limb; and a finger should be on the hole that I mentioned, until the time when we hold the cupping glass: when necessary, remove the finger, and vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will immediately be released.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then, ignite the wick according to its manner, and repeat it if you need it.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in a cupping glass administered for pleurisy with water, there is no cross-shaped rod nor hole; and it is administered only by filling it with water and placing it on the limb.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this cupping glass, the larger it is, to hold much water, the better it is.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	Concerning the suspension of leeches.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter Ninety-nine.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Leeches are not applied in multiple places, unless on those limbs where cupping is not possible, due to their small size, like the lip, and the gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a limb bare of flesh, like a finger, and the nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of their use is: that you should choose leeches that are from fresh, clean, and putrid-free waters.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they should be left in fresh water, day and night, until they are hungry, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body should be first evacuated with bloodletting and with cupping.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the sick limb until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then place them upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When, therefore, they are filled and fall, and suction of the place is possible with the cupping glass, then it is more useful: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then with much water, and it should be rubbed, and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the flow of blood, after the falling of the Sanguisugæ, continues and is oozing: then dip a linen cloth in cold water, and place it over it, until the oozing stops.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then powder crushed zegi, or gallnuts, and similar things from astringents, over it, until the blood stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or place the halves of shelled beans on the area: and let them be left until the beans adhere to the area, for the blood stops.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And if a repetition of the Sanguisuga is necessary, when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, the Sanguisugae are prevented from suspension, then the place is to be wiped with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or pierce the area with a needle until some blood comes out.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then place them, for when they feel some blood, they immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you wish them to fall off, sprinkle some crushed aloe, or salt, or ashes over them: and they will fall off immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	A universal discourse on restoration, and dislocation, and the treatment of twisting, and similar matters.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also very necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O Sons, that the foolish among physicians and the common people boast about this chapter, and those who have never examined the book of the ancients, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And because of this reason, this method is private among the sciences in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I have never encountered any good in it at all, and I have not obtained that which I have obtained from it except for the length of reading the ancient books, and the study over their understanding, until I extracted the knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study for the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from it in this chapter all that contains my knowledge; and upon that which passed my experiment, having shortened it for you, and delivered it from the occupation of elongation, and shortened it by the end of shortening, and shown it by the end of declination; and I have formed in it many forms of instruments that are administered in it, as it is from the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries, and collections of the being of fractured bones, from those whose premise is necessary before we begin the remembrance of the fractured members, and of diverse ones, if of each.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, as we say in the prologue of this chapter, to summarize the discourse, and the chapters, the understanding of which compels the artisan in the first place to stand upon their truth: namely, so that you, and those who are ready, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twisting, or fall occurs to someone, then it is necessary to hasten first to bleed him, and to release him, or both at once: if nothing prevents it, such as weakness of strength; or is he to whom something of these has happened a child, or a decrepit old man; or is it a time of great heat, or great cold intensely.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then let him be content in his food, with cold vegetables, and the flesh of birds, and kids: and forbid wine, and thick meats, and filling from foods and every food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when you are sure of the hot abscess, and do not fear the effusion of matter to the limb, then let the sick man return to his first regimen, with which his custom runs.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When, therefore, the fractured bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with nourishing foods, with much, thick, heavy nourishment, in which there is viscosity: such as foods made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of cows, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar things to them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen, the coagulation of the fracture is made quicker and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that fractured bones, when they are in men who are in early old age and decrepit, are not possible to be joined and consolidated according to their nature always, due to the drying out of their limbs; and those that are from them at the end of their softness are consolidated and joined together, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature connects upon the fractured bone from every side something similar to glue, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and binds it, until they are joined together, and bound together, until it comes to the end of its strength and firmness, as it was in the beginning, until nothing hinders it from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you place the sick person's nourishment, foods in which there are heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs; for the fracture of the leg is different from the fracture of the skull; and the fracture of the breastbone is different from the fracture of the spine; and similarly, all the other limbs are different from one another; and I have come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter, distinct from another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the types of bone fracture are diversified even within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	Because its fracture occurs in an arched way, besides which splinters happen in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes its fracture occurs along the length of the bone; and its fractures are jagged, that is, splinters and projecting additions, as are in a reed when a knife is sharpened for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not projecting; and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head; and there is a fracture with a small fissure.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And each type has a specific instrument or method for its restoration, according to which its reunion will come about, distinct in its locations.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of the bone is recognized, there is its twisting, and its own prominence; and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you compress it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	Therefore, when there is no apparent twisting in the location, nor sound upon touch when you touch the bone with agitation, nor does the patient experience great pain, then there is no fracture there, but it is possible that there is twisting, or a small fissure: therefore, it is not necessary to move it with the hand and compression at all, but rather place upon it remedies whose reunion comes about, after the time that suits the location: then a thin bandage is tightened.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when a place is bowed and split in two, besides the struggles which occur in it, nevertheless, every part is removed from its counterpart: then it is necessary for you to begin your work of straightening it, making it equal before a hot abscess happens to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	If however a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days, until the abscess subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make it equal according to whatever method is possible through gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that its restoration and its equalization is easier than in a bone where struggles occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tie it, according to what its remembrance will bring to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	If however there are struggles in the bone, then an extension of this fractured limb is necessary, from two parts, if it is a hand or a foot; or with your hand, if the limb is small; or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And let your position be such that you place the limb on an equal spot, according to its natural shape, until, when the fractured limb parts are extended, then endeavor to restore those additions to their places with all your skill, and in whatever way you can: and beware, according to your strength, that pain or injury does not result from your operation to the weak; and strive according to your strength to apply one of the two bones with its partner, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour that you try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If therefore you see something different there, rectify it, and equalize it by the extent of your ability.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many foolish ones do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many times they cause a hot abscess or contraction in the limb through their operation, as we have seen it many times from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then, after the equalization, and decent operation, and constriction of that limb, and rest, and tranquility, and advise the sick person regarding it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And have him beware lest he move it during his waking hours, and his sleep, during his turning over, and his tossing, and at his bowel movements, and all his movements with his utmost power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he beware that the limb's position not be one that will result in pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, when he feels pain or injury in the limb's position, then it is necessary that he change it to another position in which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him that his position be even, straight, so that no twisting occurs in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the fracture of the limb is, according to what I relate.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that fractured limbs are diversified in their smallness, and their size, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Therefore, those of them which are small, such as the arm, and finger, and foot, and similar to them, then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft, fine cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	However, those of them that are large, such as the thigh and leg, it is necessary that there be a wide, hard wrapping on them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because a wide ligament connects the large limb, and binds it from every side with an equal constriction, so that a spot does not enter it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then, after your evacuation, begin to apply a suitable liniment to it, in soft linen on the very site of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the bandage over the site of the fracture itself with three or four wraps, according to what the limb deserves; and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then proceed with it towards the upper part from the fracture site, and tighten less than your initial tightening with which you tightened the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then move away from the fracture site with the wrap slightly, and gradually loosen the tightening, until you grasp a large part from the healthy area.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another strip, and wrap it again over the fractured site with wraps.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then proceed with the wrap towards the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in tightening the wrap, and loosening it, according to what we have said in the first upper wrap.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the wraps soft stuffing, or cloth, with which the twisting of the fracture is equalized, if there is twisting in it: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another strip over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then place on top of these wraps appropriately formed stars immediately, if there is no swelling in the place, nor a hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is swelling in it, or an abscess: then place on it that which will settle that abscess, and remove the swelling: and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then tighten the stars on top of it.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And let the stars be from the halves of broad canes, shaved, skillfully shaped; or let them be from the wood from which sieves are made, which are made from pine or geraid, that is, palm branches, or calingi; and let the breadth of each star be, according to this shape and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the star placed upon the wound itself should be somewhat thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be in accordance with what is permitted by the limb's size and narrowness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tighten the stars with another bandage, according to the same tightness as the first.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie it from above with threads neatly, according to what we said about the tightness; and it is that your tightness should be over the fracture site more; and the further it is from the fracture, the less the tightness.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the middle threads be in thickness and thinness, and be of soft flax.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I have seen from the operation of foolish men placing their threads from twisted flax cords, it is a great error; because the tightness falls away from them, outside the quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And again, thin threads are not suitable, because you will not achieve with them, through the tightness, that which you want.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's breadth between the suture and the suture.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the patient is injured by the ends of the sutures after the tightness in healthy places, then place under them soft linen or dyed wool, until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When, however, there is a fracture with a wound, and a rupture occurs in the skin, I will come with a recollection of it in the second chapter according to its particularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And know that not every fractured limb needs to be bound with sutures from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	Because, when the limb is large, you should not place sutures upon it unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your own safety in regards to a hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the method of plasters, by which the ancients restored those that are placed upon a fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Method of an abbreviated common plaster, restoring a fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children; because it is from that which neither heat nor cold conquers.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is to take from the mill dust, and it is the flour bran that hangs in the mill walls at the grinding of the millstone: and to mix it as it is, except that you sieve it with the white of an egg: and place its mixture neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster, restoring fracture, dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take of aloes, and laudanum, and acacia, and enula, and mugath, and juice of all, each 10 drams; of myrrh and aloes, each 5 drams; and alethil 20 drams.  Grind all, and sift, and mix with alethil water; or with the white of an egg, if the patient's complexion is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster, which also benefits fracture and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take of mugath, and mess, and white marshmallow, of all 10 drams; of myrrh and aloes, each 5 drams; of acacia 6 drams; of Armenian bole 20 drams.  Grind all thoroughly, and sift, and make into a poultice with water, or the white of an egg, and apply.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	A method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places; and it relieves the pain that accompanies them, and the cracking and fracturing of the bone.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool, and soak it in vinegar and boiled oil, and place it on the affected area.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster there is no power of restoration, but it is good for calming a hot abscess, and it specifically drives away pains.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of plaster which restores a fractured bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of the common fig and leaves of wild poppy; and grind them all, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of a shortened plaster, administered in the restoration of a fractured bone, and when you desire the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take of marshmallow root, camomile, violet flowers, and herb flour, of each one part: grind them all, and mix them with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If, however, it is inflamed, then make it with water of moist coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Method of another stronger plaster for resolution, than this first one, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take of marshmallow root, linseed, pomegranate bark, melilot, marsh mallow, violet flowers, and camomile, of each one part; grind them all, and mix them with willow water, or with fresh water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the warmth of the limb and the quiet of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that anything should be placed on a fractured limb during its restoration except a cerotum made of wax and oil: nothing else; and he recounted that it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	However, Galen thought that things should be placed upon a fractured limb during its restoration that have a drying effect on heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and olibanum, and similar to those we have narrated.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	Method of the plaster that helps for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mugwort, and chickpeas, and the hairs of a man's head, cut, or bird feathers, and marsh mallows, and salt, in equal parts: grind them, and sieve them, and mix them together: and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	The quantity of time, after which the bandage should remain and then be released, is as follows: if no pain or itching occurs in the sick person, and if the fractured bone does not move from its place, then do not remove it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	But if intense itching, or troublesome pain, or swelling occurs in that place: then quickly release it immediately and remove the plaster from it: and take a soft cloth, or a soft sea sponge, moistened: and immerse it in lukewarm water, and cleanse the place with it, until the itching ceases, and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place upon it wool cut finely, soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bind it upon it for one night, until you are certain of the absence of a hot abscess, and the swelling of the limb subsides, and its pain disappears.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply a thin bandage and a small plaster: and do not tighten it with your first binding, and bind it thinly thereafter until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling, and all the associated problems have completely disappeared, and you no longer need a plaster and bandage, then treat it again as you did at first, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If nothing from what we have said occurs to the limb, then do not loosen it, except after three, or four, or five, or seven days.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when twenty days have passed, judging from the condition of the limb as we have described, until the fracture adheres, and the flesh around it is fully consolidated, then add more bandage than your initial one, and increase the strength of the dressing, according to its previous description.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If you see the fracture site becoming dry and thinning more than necessary, then know that nourishment is being prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore, apply warm water to it every time you loosen it, and let it remain for all three days, and slightly ease the bandage.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Through this operation, nourishment reaches the limb, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what foolish bone setters do in a limb's fracture a second time, when it was not initially set correctly, and is set crookedly, is an error in their practice, and a great fear.  And if it were correct, the ancients would have written about it in their books, and performed it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I have seen no trace of it at all in that, and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Concerning the accidental fracture of the head.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The types of fracture are diverse, and its shapes are many: and its causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For there is a fracture that occurs from striking with a sword: and the blow removes the bone completely as far as it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, as an axe does in wood: and because of this, this type of fracture is called Axialis.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the sword cuts some part of the bone, and cuts its surface, and the incision does not penetrate to its innermost part: and this type of fracture is called Kalaan, that is, a Lifting absolutely.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a wound of two fractures, either great or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And there is a fracture which is a crushing, or grinding: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also either penetrating, which already approaches the tissue, which is beneath the bone: or it is on the surface of the bone: and the wound of these two fractures is also either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone in the subtlety of a hair: and it is a small fissure, and because of that this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture, which is made from a fall, or a blow with a stone, and similar things, which cause the lamina of the bone to enter into the interior, and a hollow is made: just as happens to copper pots, when a blow strikes them, and part of them enters into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And this happens most often in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures are produced by separate efforts, and I will return with a reminder of it all in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fractures by probing over them, and by investigating them with probes, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is over them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The Capillary species, however, is recognized by this, that it is detected upon the bone, and is scraped away, and is painted over it with ink: for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the accidents of the sick person: then if you see from the accidents that it signifies evident indications of fear, such as vomiting, cholera, extension, loss of understanding, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, protrusion of the eyes, redness of them, and similar accidents in many dispositions, undoubtedly it is not cured: and if you see accidents not terrifying you, and you hope for health, then begin its treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	If a wounded person comes to you immediately after being wounded, and it is in the days of winter, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the pannicle is corrupted, and those accidents which we have narrated occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has now reached the pannicle touching the brain, and is with small pieces and drawing, then it is necessary to remove the broken and ground parts, as I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And you should shave the head of the wounded person, and uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you, and according to the shape of the wound, and what is easy for the sick person.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess occurs, then apply to it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And you should fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and keep the wound at rest until the abscess subsides and you are secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method is to cut the bone with a scalpel of sharp edge, and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then apply another scalpel somewhat wider than the first, and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then apply yet another scalpel wider still than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second method is to have various scalpels available, some wider than others, and some shorter than others; and let their cutting edges be sharp, and let them be of tempered iron, or steel; and use gentleness in striking the scalpel, so that it does not strike the head and injure it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	However, if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary to pierce around it, before you apply the scalpels, with drills called shallow drills; and they are not so called unless because they do not pass through the limit of the bony tissue to that which is behind it; because a drill has a rounded end above that which is under its pointed head, similar to an edge, and a small circle prevents it from sinking and passing through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it befits you to take many of these drills, each one appropriate to the thickness of the bone, until you have a drill for every skull; whose pointed end in length and shortness should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three types of drills, or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The method of piercing around a fractured bone is this: place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then change the drill to another place, and put that which is between each hole the thickness of a radius, or about that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the chisels that which is between each hole from the bone, and make it finer than you can on it from the end of lightness, as we said, until you eradicate the bone, either with your hand or with some other of those instruments that you have prepared for it: such as pliers and fine forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you beware with every precaution, lest the drill or chisel touch anything of the siphac.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you have encircled the bone by piercing, and it has been separated from the siphac, if it has been continuous with it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary to smooth and even the extremity of that which remains in the bone with another similar instrument, like a chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it be thinner and more subtle than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If any small pieces of bone remain, and splinters: then take them with ease, with that which is at hand of your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then treat the wound after that with the dressings and ointments which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, entirely remote from fear: which Galen said, and praised it with great praise: and this is his statement.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	You must first begin to uncover the portion of bone in the place where the fracture is more violent and more evident; until when you have uncovered that part, and have placed under it the extremity of this lenticular chisel, of which this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part cuts nothing smoothly; and its sharp part, going lengthwise on its two sides, as you see; so that the lenticular part rests against the bone, its sharp face striking the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike the chisel from one side with a small mallet, until you cut the whole bone with ease, as if it were turning over; and you be sure by the cloth that no accident happens to it that you would entirely fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish than men, and more ignorant of it, nor were asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it from it with the extremity of his lenticular chisel, and would free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	It is freed from it without harm and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is cut off from the bone is its surface, and there remain in it roughnesses and subtle irregularities, then it is necessary that you smooth those roughnesses and eradicate those irregularities with the fine razors from which you have prepared a variety of sizes, so that it may be possible for you to administer from them the most suitable and the straightest ones according to the place, according to the work that leads you, and the broken bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary that you administer in your judgment, with which at first you scrape the bone, more broadly than those razors.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a finer one.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do this according to continuity, until you arrive at administering the thinnest and finest of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every remaining small fissure, and fine fracture, it is necessary that you give care, according to that which leads to its straightening.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a matter not hidden from everyone who has any study in this art, and has stood upon what we have written and shown in large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the flap is retained when you remove the bone, then it is necessary to take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth, doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and do it as easily as you can over that, so that it is not weighted by this.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a wide bandage over it: and do not bind it tightly, unless to the extent that holds the wound only: and leave it with this care for one day, or two days, until you are sure of being free from a hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then unbind it, and apply after that remedies with which superfluous dryness is overcome; such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and birthwort, and similar to them: and it is that you make a powder from these remedies, which is powdered over the wound as they are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally apply to it any medicine whose property is to cleanse, and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment is clear; neither be there any dirt of ointment, nor any filth.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor allow the virus to gather on it at all: because when the virus gathers on the membranes of the brain, it corrupts it and makes it putrid, and great harm comes upon the sick person after that; and it occurs in the head, when the bone is cleansed from it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then, if the accidents which we have stated befall the sick person, know that it is undoubtedly harmful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed upon it, and is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness; then it is necessary that you take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and lines with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the bone: afterwards, treat it with the kinds of treatment that are suitable, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of the Nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that the upper two parts of the nose are not broken except simultaneously, or one of them: because they are two bones; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and only attrition, twisting, and crookedness occur to it.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert a small finger into the nostril, and straighten that fracture with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware that your operation does not cause pain to the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it is necessary to straighten it with the end of a radius bone, where there is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If, however, the fracture is in two parts, then do the same; and hasten its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day, at rest from a hot abscess.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a bandage of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part; or insert two bandages if the fracture is in two parts; and let the bandage have a thickness of such quantity as to fill the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that the bandages should be soaked in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	However, that does not seem to me; rather, it is necessary that the bandage be soaked in egg white, mixed with mill dust.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then leave the bandage until the bone is strengthened and the cartilage hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the nose in place of the bandage, after a soft cloth has been wrapped around it; and it does so that it holds the nose fracture more firmly, and so that the weak person is not prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do it; and if you wish, do the bandages.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If, while treating a hot boil on the nose, the nose should again be injured, plaster the nose with cerote, or with cot infused in rose oil, or with a small amount of diaquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	However, if a hot boil does not occur, then it is necessary to plaster it with sesame flour and powdered frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place soft lint over it, and do not bandage the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose are fractured or broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to split them open and remove them with instruments suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the fissure, and treat it with that which causes it to heal and to consolidate with appropriate plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If a wound occurs between the nostrils, then it is necessary to treat it with strips of cloth and apply a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is fractured.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured, and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then see if the fracture is only on the outside, and it does not break into two pieces, and is bent inwards; then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the patient's mouth; likewise, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand; and with it, gently push the curvature of the fracture outward from the inside with your other hand from the inner side of the bone, and with it straighten it.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply external pressure from both sides, in a straight line, until its alignment is possible.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, movement or breakage has already occurred in the teeth, then bind those which you hope remain with gold, silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a poultice on the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and place a large, properly made compress over the cloth; or an equal piece of sole leather, the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to the preparation for its ligature and the suitability of its application, until it is not broken; and instruct the patient to use tranquility and quiet, and give him soft drinks as food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you estimate that something of its shape has already been altered in any way, then hasten and loosen it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then rectify what has been altered in it, and plaster it with mill dust, with egg white, or with sesame flour, after you have removed the poultice; and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that plaster remains attached to it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not loosen it, until it is healed; or the fracture is tightened.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often tightened within three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, meanwhile, a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often said in its sedation, until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If a fragment is already separated from the bone, or from the surrounding tissue, then be meticulous in this, so that you remove those fragments of the surrounding tissue with whatever is suitable to you in removing them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If truly the wound opening is constricted, then widen it with a phlebotom as much as your need requires.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then, when you have removed that surrounding tissue, and nothing remains of it, then suture the wound opening, if it is wide; and if not, place over it plasters that are suitable for it, and cause it to heal, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	Concerning the restoration of a fork, when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, a fork is most often broken from the anterior part on the humerus side, and its fracture occurs in one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Either it breaks and separates into two, apart from the tissues that occur on it; and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or, such that tissues occur in the bone; and it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or, such that it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation on it, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two attendants present, so that one of them holds the aid that follows the fractured fork, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then adjust the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be; and there should be neither a prominence nor a hollow in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then it is necessary that you place under the patient's armpit a sphere of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your necessary quantity; and extend and lift the fork, and contract the sphere with your hand, until you equalize the fracture as it should be.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the extremity of the fork outward, because it has reached a depth, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on their neck; and you should place a medium-sized bolster under their shoulder, and the attendant should press on their shoulder downward until the bone of the fork that is deep is brought upward; and then straighten the fracture and equalize it with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If, however, you feel a splinter from the fork and it moves, then it is necessary that you cut above it, and extract the splinter with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If, however, it is retained in the bone, then make an incision on it with one of the incissors you have prepared for it, after you have placed under the fork the instrument that keeps the sifach; and it is an instrument of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spoon without a concavity.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And let its width be according to that which you need from the size of the bone, and its smallness.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length, however, also according to what is possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it shall have two extremities, as you see: and one extremity shall be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If however the rupture of the wound that you made when you extracted the splintered bone is wide, and you guard against a hot abscess: then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the rupture is small, or you fear a hot abscess: then fill the wound with cloths and bandages according to the amount of the wound's fissure.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If a hot abscess should occur, then soak a cloth in rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it upon it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	A constriction of the bone, however, when it is without a wound and without incision, is such that you should place upon the bone a plaster made from mill flour with egg white.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place soft lint upon it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere beneath its tip, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a *himematem*, that is, a wheel held by the Saracens, which is very long, and let its width be one palm, or approximately that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled pad over the lint and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a thin plank, whose width is three fingers, and similarly in length.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap that cloth with the plank in the place of the alhimemati that falls over the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alhimemati over the fracture as it revolves, and wrap it over its neck, and under its healthy joint, and under its diseased joint: and reduce it over every part, and as you see that the constriction holds the fracture in a fitting constriction: and that is, what is not concealed from you, and all of it, so that the plank is not removed from over the fractured bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this it is necessary that you look after the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Therefore, whenever the ligament softens, and you see the plank already removed, then straighten it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his joint at his sleep at night, so that with it his help may be raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the fork is raised by the elevation of the humerus.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck, and do not loosen the bandage if it does not happen in a place where an accident comes from itching or from an abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see its face at that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and leave him until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And indeed the fracture of the fork is tightened and strengthened mostly in twenty-eight days; and sometimes it happens in some men in a shorter time than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	Concerning the restoration of the fracture of the shoulder blade.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The shoulder blade is rarely broken, and in its broad area; and only its margins are broken from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	Therefore, when a part of it is broken, and it is broken in its middle, and this is not recognized except by touch, then, according to the nature of the fracture, attempt its preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to its natural shape by every means of skill possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place mill dust with egg white, and soft linen, and place a cushion of doubled cloth on top.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place a wide splint of thin wood, according to the size of the entire shoulder blade, or a little larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	If, however, there is a concavity under the splint in any part of the shoulder blade, then equalize that concavity with soft linen until the splint descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then bind it from above with a long bandage, with a fitting constriction, and firmness of the splint, until it cannot be removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Therefore, whenever the bandage softens, tighten it, and adjust the splint if it is displaced from its place: and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the shoulder blade indeed is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When therefore this number is complete, then loosen the bandage: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose connection is not feared, nor their separation.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however a piece of bone projects, and pierces beneath the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said in the fracture of the furcula from the suppuration of a hot abscess, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured breast.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in its middle, and that rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities, indeed, are broken and shattered by its accidents most often.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle breaks, which inclines downwards, and a severe pain and difficulty in breathing and coughing occur to it, and perhaps it vomits blood, and a cavity is revealed in the fractured bone, and is not hidden from the senses, its restoration is that the infirm person be laid supine on their back, and a cushion be placed between their shoulder blades.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders, and gather the ribs from both sides with your hands, and adjust them to their proper alignment, as much as possible and appropriate, until the shape of the bone returns to its proper form.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and a bandage on it, and place on top of that a thin board of willow or chalingi, or similar light materials, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then adjust it in binding it over the fractured bone, so it does not move; and proceed with the bandage around the back several times, and tighten it with a proper tightening.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then check the bandage every hour, and whenever it loosens, tighten it; and if its necessity calls for its removal because of itching or corrosion occurring in the area, or pain, or abscess, then quickly untie it and remove the plaster, and correct whatever happened with its method of treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then replace the plaster, if you see it to be in place; and apply a bandage to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Concerning the restoration of Ribs, when they are fractured.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that a rib fracture does not occur except in the thick parts that follow the back, and from their extremities on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And there is no friction of them unless because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And its knowledge is not hidden from sense in investigation with the fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is done so that the fracture is made equal with the fingers according to the possible manner, until the shape is made equal, according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then plasters, and bind the broken bone with splints, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the rib fracture is sloping inwards, then a violent pain and piercing occurs to the sick person, like the piercing that occurs to one who has pleurisy; because the bone pierces the membrane, and also a shortness of breath, and coughing, and the vomiting of much blood occurs; and this is a difficult cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients have devised many methods for it: and among them are those who say to place the sick person's foods that produce inflammation and windiness, so that the belly is inflamed and extended and the fracture is driven outwards.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We however abhor, lest a quick cause of a hot abscess be made, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If however it already happened, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: let a windy substance be placed upon the area, then it be sucked with strength, and this is similar reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the windy substance will draw superfluities to the area, due to the disposition of the weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: the area should be covered with wool already submerged in hot oil; and cushions should be placed between the ribs until it is full; so that there is an even bandage when you wrap it according to the roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick person should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, through food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If a violent thing constricts the sick person, which they cannot tolerate, and the mouth stings or the covering wounds with a piercing injury, and we fear for the sick person, then it is necessary to cut over the area and uncover the fractured rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we shall place upon it the instrument that preserves the fistula, the description of which preceded: and we shall cut the mouth with ease, and cut it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we shall bring together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures; and we shall treat it with plasters until it is healed.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If meanwhile a hot abscess occurs, then hurry, and pour powders in rose oil, and place it upon the area; and let the sick person be treated with what is suitable for the abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, let the person lie on the side on which they sleep, until they are healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Concerning the restoration of the fractured spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	A fracture of the neck bones sometimes occurs, and attrition rarely happens to them; and similarly to the vertebrae of the back as well.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	Therefore, when this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and in most cases is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If he moves them, and feels the contraction with the fingers and the prick, then know that the neck bone is sound, and that the patient will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If a similar thing happens to the vertebrae of the back, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, then consider his feet. If you see that they are softened, and that what happened to the hands happens to them, then when he lies on his back, wind and excrement come out involuntarily; and when he lies on his stomach, excrement comes out involuntarily; and when he lies on his back, and wants to urinate, and cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in his treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If however, nothing of that happens to him, the matter is less serious.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment for what happens from that is to attempt the calming of a hot abscess; thus, that you place on the vertebra, ground rose oil alone; or with the yolks of a roasted egg.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place that on it several times a day, until when the hot abscess is calmed; then place on the spot one of the strengthening, drying plasters, and bind over it with a bandage; and order the sick person to use quiet and rest.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep on the part where he finds pain until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If it happens at a rubbed-away bone, or something that has already separated from it: then it is necessary to cut above the skin, and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with some healing ointment, from unguents, until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If, however, the last bone of the alhausos breaks, and is the end of the tail: then it is necessary that you insert the thumb of your left hand into the anus, and adjust the broken bone with the other hand, as far as possible, and with a second adjustment.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place it on top of it, and remove it: and treat the wound with the previous treatment, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Concerning the restoration of the Ancha.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the Ancharum rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they do break, then their fracture is not, unless it is a shattering at their extremities: and they are split lengthwise, and deflected inwards: and pain and a puncture occur in the affected place, and the leg that breaks is stunned.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And its restoration is indeed to extend your hand over it, until you stand upon the fracture as its form is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only at its extremities, then equalize that fracture, according to what is prepared for you by the equalization, until it is made similar to its natural form.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however the fracture is lengthwise, or already bends inwards, then make the sick person lie on their stomach, until its fracture's restoration is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have equalized it, place a plaster upon it; then place a splint of wood or leather upon it; and bind a bandage over it such that you do not fear the fracture's shifting, nor the splint's removal.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equalize the concavity of those things with that which fills it, until the bandage takes it according to equality; and command the sick person to sleep on their back, or on their healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however a hot abscess occurs to him, then cease from the extension of it, and its restoration, until the hot abscess subsides; and place upon it that which settles it, according to what preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however it occurs in the bone, splinters, or is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The arm is that which is between the elbow and the shoulder blade.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If therefore it is fractured, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: to take a piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bandages are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it should be hung from a high place: and the sick person should sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he should place his fractured arm over the wood, until it reaches the tickling of it, in the middle of which is attached the curve of the wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something heavy above it, so that the attendant extends it downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the physician should align the fracture with his hands together, until the fracture returns, as it should.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another method is that the sick person should lie on their back: and suspend their arm from their neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two attendants, that one of them should hold that which is above the fracture with his hands, and that the other should hold below it, and that each of them should pull towards their side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish the extension to be stronger, then tie under the fracture with one bandage, and above it with another bandage, and let each of the two attendants pull them towards their own sides.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the end of the humerus, then it is necessary that one bandage be placed under the elbow, and another under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a bandage be placed over that place and over the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then straighten the fracture gently without effort, until when the fracture is straightened as it should be, and a good application is applied, then tie it, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place upon it cut wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until when the abscess subsides; then tie it: and the manner of tying it is, that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then bind the arm to the support itself, and place his open hand on his shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and tie the arm to the support, so that the arm stands in the position of stars: if nothing prevents you from that, nor is anything disturbed on you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something from the broken bone will be disturbed on you, then use splints: and it is that you place a splint over the fracture itself which is broader and stronger than the other splints.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between each splint the width of a finger: and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind the splints with the bandage I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is that your bandage should be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture is extended, the less tight the bandage should be.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the splints and the bandage, as we said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do so; and if you fear a hot abscess, then leave the bandage and the splints until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament for all three days, lest itching or swelling occur in the place, or lest food be prevented from reaching the limb, owing to the disposition of excess from the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, rectify all of it, according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If however you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not loosen the bandage, unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the patient sleep on his back, and his hands on his stomach: and place under his assistance a mattress full of wool evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day that the shape of the fractured limb is not loosened or the bandage softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Therefore, rectify all of that with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And give the patient food according to the order we have previously stated, so that there should be delicate food at first, until his mouth begins to tighten: then it is necessary to increase the thickness of his food.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For it is the custom of a swollen leg and foot to tighten in forty days: then, therefore, it is necessary to loosen it and give a bath and to treat it with ointments that rectify it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul, bruised: then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it until fifty days, and even until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of which is small; and it is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and it is the one that is situated below the small one on the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps therefore only the larger forearm bone is broken, or the smaller one, and perhaps both are broken at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller forearm bone is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the forearm bone is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And worse than that is when both bones are broken simultaneously.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm bone above, then it is fitting for the physician, in restoring it, to apply a small amount of extension with ease, until it is straightened.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If however the larger forearm bone is that which is broken, then it is necessary that he apply a much stronger bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary that he apply a hand-shaped bandage in restoring it, and extend its extension over a pillow.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be higher than all the fingers; and let the lower joint be lower than all the other fingers; and let the patient, sitting upright, be positioned squarely over himself, and let the pillow be before him, or in a direct line with him, in height, so that the patient does not incur fatigue.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let the attendant extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another attendant extend it from above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should adjust the bone until he restores it to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are fragments in the fractured bone, then strive to restore each fragment to its proper place with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If, however, a detached fragment appears in it, and it pierces the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration, then dissect over it and remove it according to the method we have mentioned in the previous ones.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If, however, the fracture is with a wound, I have already made a special chapter on it, therefore receive the treatment for it from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then apply a bandage with a cerate made from rose oil, white wax, and of a consistency between thick and thin; and bind the bandage tightly over it until the abscess subsides; then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster prepared from mill-dust with egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place splints, and let the splint placed over the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of arm splints is six in most cases, whether the fracture is in one or two forearm bones simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then apply your binding over the fracture site more strongly and vigorously, and somewhat more tightly towards the upper or lower portion of the fracture; or apply a looser binding, slightly less tight than the first, as previously described at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the cloths wrapped around the fracture be soft, damp; and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread with which it is tied be of linen, medium between fine and coarse, as we have described.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything should happen requiring correction, such as itching occurring to the limb, then it is necessary to bathe the limb with warm water until that itching subsides, and to leave the limb unbound until it subsides, then reapply the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the constriction has now softened, and the bone has now been removed, and similar things to these: then correct all of it with your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of the excess of the constriction, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and to leave it for some days, until nourishment flows to it, then bind it.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	However, if nothing of what we have said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or about this number.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the sick person's hand should be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be even, and let it be guarded by his skill from violent movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days: and perhaps it is restored in twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All that is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the virtue.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Concerning the restoration of fractures of the Hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that fracture of the hand's ridges and the knots of the fingers rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not occur to it unless by very frequent rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, when a fracture or abrasion of the sole occurs, then it is necessary that the infirm person sit square, and there be a seat before him according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand upon it outstretched.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then let the attendant extend the broken bones, and let the physician align them until when they are joined with a good juncture.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he place a plaster and tow, if a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is towards the lower part, roughly the sole of the foot, then make a sphere out of cloth and order the sick person to press upon it with their fractured foot. Then tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the bandage be made of leather, in which there is softness, so that the leather is applied to the sole of the foot; and bind it, as is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If however the fracture is to the outside, then it is necessary that you place a bandage over it, and another bandage from below on the sole; and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a bandage, as the hand is turned; and stretch between the fingers with a ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture should occur in any of the finger joints, then if it is the thumb, it should be made equal according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then bind it to the sole; and if you wish, place a straight, small bandage on it, so that the fracture is raised and does not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If however the fracture is in the remaining fingers, such as the middle, and index, or ring, and little finger, then it should be made equal and bound to the healthy finger that follows it; or all should be bound according to their continuation; and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small bandage on it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the disposition of the hot abscess itself: and apply with it what is necessary, when anything arises from it, according to the repetition of its account.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken, and it is clear to the senses, since it is turned to the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is done so that the ligament above the fracture, and the ligament below the fracture, are tightened.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person lies prostrate on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then the attendant should extend each ligament on their side, equally; and this, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If however the fracture is near the root of the hip, then let one ligament be on the side of the crest, so that the extension falls upward; and the other ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then let the ligament be near the knee, so that the extension is downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should align the bone with both hands, until he restores it to its natural shape, and the bone is joined with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, if a wound does not occur in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If however a wound occurs in it: then leave it for a few days, until the hot wound subsides, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, its bandage should be like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to wrap the hard bandage, that is, the binding, over the fracture: and double it twice, or three times: and let some excess remain.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the heel reaches the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee, towards the lower part, and let the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two sections.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then wrap the excess from the bandage over the leg and thigh.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place splints on the thigh, at the site of the fracture itself, and place one splint over the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the tightness is equalized.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle, over the fracture site, in three or four wraps.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the further you extend the bandage from the fracture site, the less tight and softer and gentler your bandage should be.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pull on the two ends of the thread that you inserted between the thigh and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie then with both ends the three splints that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then proceed with the two ends of the thread to the lower part, until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both ends, also tighten the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the bandage does not move from its position.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then release the constriction upon it, while it remains, so that no ulceration, nor abscess, nor swelling, and similar things, occur to the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If anything of that sort happens.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, hasten with its solution, and correct whatever happened from it entirely, according to what we have often said.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	If, however, there is a piece of bone in the bone that pierces: then it is necessary to smooth it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, split upon it, and remove it, and treat it with what was previously mentioned, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides which splints are added to it, as we said in the help and the arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in its restoration thus fractured, lameness does not happen to the sick person.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides which the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he whose it is should limp always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound for fifty days, or is somewhat added to, or is somewhat lessened: all that is according to the diversity of complexions, and of the other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that a fracture of the kneecap rarely occurs, but it often experiences attrition.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If, however, a fracture does occur, then it is only either a fissure or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is both with a wound and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it stands upon all of that with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is such that the parts of it that are broken are aligned with the fingers, until they are brought together and joined as much as possible by means of alignment, ease, and making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then apply a plaster of sesame flour, or mill flour, with egg white: and put a round pad on top of it, if you need one: and bind tightly above it with an appropriate bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the treatments we have described in other fractures: like a hot abscess, and similar things: so that you oppose each accident with what is appropriate to it, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Concerning the restoration of a fractured leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is thick and is called the Cruris bone, and the other thin, and is called the Focile bone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And the same types of fracture occur in both, as occur in the two bones of the arm; and because of that, its restoration is done in the same way as the arm's restoration, and the operation is the same.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken at the same time, the leg is twisted in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is twisted towards the front.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it lower; and it is from among those which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer extension, and alignment, and the tying of splints according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having much bleeding, so that the extension should be less and your easing gentler.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg indeed there is something in the operation above the arm; and it is, that when you have aligned the splints and completed all your operation, then take two strips of pinewood, that is used in the making of rafters that are placed beneath planks; and are made of palm leaves; and choose from those which have a small thickness, and neither are from the smallest; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap each one with two wraps according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side, and the other on the other side; and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips in three places, from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when constriction is prohibited, the leg declines to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And now indeed let a cradle be administered made of wood according to the length of the leg, and let the leg be placed in it, so that it may keep it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And very much indeed it is necessary that you do this in a fracture when there is a wound with it properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and strive with utmost care to treat it for an abscess, or swelling, or any other ailments.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore anything of those things happens, then apply to it what is necessary until it is healed, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the fracture of the bones of the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	A fracture of the heel bone indeed does not happen at all.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, a fracture of the bones of the Foot sometimes happens, and a fracture also rarely happens to the Toes; and it does not happen to them except for attrition in many dispositions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture of the bones of the Foot occurs, and you see those bones elevated above one another, then let the patient place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand you, and place your foot upon that which is elevated from those bones; afterward press, or tread it down; and make it even, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then apply a plaster, and put linen over it; and place a small board beneath the sole of the foot, having two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with a proper bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and whatever else it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When therefore three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones aligned, whether broken or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore the operation on them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If however some fingers are broken, then restore them and align them according to what I have told you about restoring the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint along the length of the finger, and let it be slightly wider than it; then place beneath the foot this board that I have told you about, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If, however, what is broken of the bones is two, or three, or more, then place a splint of its appropriate size over each finger, wrapped in linen cloth; and bind the board to the lower part of the foot; and let it stand on one edge of the board outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds with good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it befits you, lest you forget, to consider all that I have told you in the other fractures from accidents that we have discussed; and counter every accident with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	Concerning the fracture of a woman's vulva, and the bone of the breastbone, and the penis of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's vulva is fractured, then make her sit upright.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then incline her towards her own back a little, and let her be held back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then let the midwife fill her vulva with wool, until it fills it: and let it become in the vulva like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that wool will emerge, until it becomes like a sphere before the vulva's opening, and the fractured opening returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a cushion on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	Therefore, when she wishes to urinate, remove the wool with ease, then let her urinate: and return it according to the manner in which you first inserted it: then return to her original cushion.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let him do this for seven days, or thereabouts, for the opening itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a reed tube over its opening, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the tube with force, until the bladder inflates within the vulva, for the rupture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then let it be filled with wool, and let it stand for several days, according to what we have narrated, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the comb of a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and its equalization that which we have narrated concerning the bone of the hip.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the rectum is not concealed in these nearby fractures, which occur rarely, especially in those who have some study or practice of it.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand this book of mine thoroughly, for the fracture itself signifies to you in many dispositions the right way in its restoration and its constriction: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when a man's penis is broken, take the throat of a goose, and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place upon it a bandage of cloth, and let it be wrapped and left for three days, or thereabouts, and it will heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	Concerning the restoration of fractured bones, when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It is appropriate for one who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, like the hip bone, or the auxiliary bone, or similar to it, that you hasten and immediately bleed him: if the conditions of bloodletting are witnessed to you, as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound flows blood, then it is necessary that you hasten to its excision, so that you pulverize ground zegi upon it: if another is not present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that same day: and do not postpone it, if an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If, however, a hot abscess occurs, then postpone its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is settled.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would cause him to experience bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If, however, the fractured bone is protruding above the skin, then it is necessary that you try to reduce it, and to make it level with your hands with ease and little extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, its extension and its levelling with your hands are not prepared, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And it is an instrument made of iron, whose length is the amount of seven or eight fingers, and its width is according to the amount of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And because of that, it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four, according to the quantity he needs for the treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round, and let there be a small thickness in it, so that it is not doubled under compression upon it at the time of the operation; and let it be sharp at the ends, with a margin at its ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let its upper part be at the thickness from its middle to the lower part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation that its sharp curved end be placed upon the projecting end of the bone, and to drive it with it in one turn, until when the bone returns and is made equal by some equalization.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, try to make the fractured ends even with each other.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its fractured ends are thin, and it does not receive the instrument with good acceptance, then it is necessary that you cut the end of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If however you cannot reduce them with what we have narrated entirely, then cut it with what is suitable for it from the incisions we have mentioned, or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then scrape away what remains in the bone of roughness and small splinters.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and the sick person finds intense pain harming him after its reduction, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do therefore that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer great aid to the sick person when your restoration of the bone is completed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse a cloth in astringent, black wine.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And properly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place a roasted piece of meat on the wound, nor anything containing oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption within it.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer the splints at the hour of completion of your restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And leave the wound uncovered; thus, cut with scissors an opening in the dressings according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, lest you bind the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused their patients either death, or decay, or putrid matter, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And let your bandage be soft, gentle, different from the bandage of other fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you fear some bad accident, which we have described, and find pain in the suspended area: then you should not place splints upon it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them bandages of hard cloths in place of splints, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When however it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then remove the cloth that you placed over it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply bandages and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is suitable for you to loosen the bandage.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that pus runs from it downwards with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass over the wound, and it is not consolidated, nor is pus separated from it: then know that there are small bone splinters there.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore it is necessary to examine the wound with probes.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	Remove any of those splinters that are separated, and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain to occur, try to cut them and remove them by any means possible to you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If a wound suffers from a zuchen, or ekileten, that is, festering, or some other form of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary to apply to each of them the appropriate remedy from the treatment, of which the account precedes in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in that which my discourse must dwell upon, and to which you must direct your mind when a bone is fractured and protrudes from the limb, such as the hip bone, and the arm bone, and similar large bones, do not presume to pull it back, for often death results from that; rather, leave it until it becomes rotten.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall out by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, if it seems good to you, treat the wound; and if not, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	Concerning the treatment of Swelling at the site of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This swelling often occurs at the site of healing from a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially if it is near the joints, and it disfigures the shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it hinders the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, if the swelling is recent, apply remedies that have astringent properties, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So that you take some, or all, of these, and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar, and place them over the swelling on a bandage, and bind them firmly over it.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the bandage on, and do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it and apply another, until the swelling is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind a lead sheet over it properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	However, if the swelling has already turned to stone, and is hard, and urgent need compels its removal: then cut upon it from above, and cut away the protruding excess; or scrape it with certain scrapers until it is removed; and treat it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	Concerning the treatment when it is restored, and the limb remains after that slender, not according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When a broken bone is restored, and the limb remains after that slender, weak, then that is not so except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is, the multitude of loosening of the ligament and its tying not according to what is proper; or because of the excess of tightening of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or because of the multitude of excessive poulticing at an unsuitable time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body of the weak person, and their weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the treatment of that is, to nourish the sick person, and to make their body soft, until the blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and gladness upon him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place pitch upon the limb: that the pitch may attract much nourishment to it.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And diligently apply embrocation to it with lukewarm water, until the nourishment flows, and it returns to its natural form.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When, after healing, a limb already restored shows crookedness, and a prominence of the fractured bone, or a knot: and its limb's shape is disfigured thereby, yet the limb is not hindered from its natural function: then it is not necessary to heed the opinion of one who thinks that the limb should be fractured again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And many foolish physicians and bone-setters have already done so in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that it is potentially lethal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and knotting are recent, then it is necessary to bathe it with lukewarm water in which softening herbs have been boiled, such as marshmallow leaves and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And a poultice should be made with a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or take the mucilage of marshmallow root and mix it with hen's fat or sesame oil, and plaster it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or take fat figs and grind them with pigeon dung, and similar medicinal substances which are said to lessen consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the knotting is loosened with constant, ancient, and gentle rubbing, which is done with damp hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And movement of the limb should be administered to every part at all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If, however, twisting has already occurred, and it has become strong, and has turned into stone, and the necessity for its treatment with iron has arisen: then it is necessary that it be cut above it, and the continuity of the bone be loosened, and that what is superfluous from the knotting or bone be cut with fine incisions: and ease should be administered to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Concerning the treatment of dislocations.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of any joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore, it is prevented from its movement, and the shape of the limb is disfigured.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pain and grievous injuries to the afflicted.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore, when any dislocation occurs, it is necessary to hasten its restoration; nor should one delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed, and perhaps the reduction of the dislocation with it.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it is not appropriate for it to be moved or stretched during the time of its inflammation.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because it often causes spasms and harmful pains.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, then it is necessary to hasten to the phlebotomy of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be left alone until the inflammation subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be reduced gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And every limb should be treated with that whose memory comes to its proper place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have indeed already arranged the chapters on dislocation, even as preceded in fractures, from the upper part of the body to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two jaws are seldom dislocated except rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	For either they are moved from their places by a small movement, and are softened a little.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated by a complete dislocation, until they are softened to the part of the chest, until the sick person's saliva runs, and cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped up with his speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When however its dislocation is small, then it returns in many ways by itself with little effort.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	However, if the dislocation is complete, entire: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, and not be delayed at all; and it is so that the attendant holds the sick person's head; and the physician inserts the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocated jawbone between his mouth, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or let him insert two of his thumbs together, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hands should be outside, with which he will balance.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to clean their jaws and to free them to eat in every direction.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician should balance the jaw, and push the jaw until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated at once, then administer vaporization with hot water and oil until the reduction of both becomes easy; nor delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When therefore they return and are balanced, and the sick person's mouth is closed, and does not soften: then place cushions of cloths upon them, with cerot which is made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it should be bound with ease with soft bandages.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the sick person's sleep be on his back, and let his head be supported between two pillows, so that he does not move it to the right and left; nor attempt, or be forced, to chew anything; rather, let his food be soft, to be drunk, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound; then let him eat what he wants, and let it be administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	Let him not exert himself over the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking, and yawning, until the jaw is bound, and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If the reduction of the two jaws becomes difficult, when they are dislocated at any hour, and do not return to their places: then often fevers and constant sweating ensue; and perhaps the sick person's bowels are loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, know that it is destruction, and often the one who suffers this dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	Of the reduction of the dislocation of the collarbone, and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXVI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The collarbone indeed does not dislocate from the inner side, because of its continuity with the breastbone.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it sometimes dislocates outwards: and that is apparent to the senses.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the sick person lie on their back, and extend their arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then grasp the place with a strong hand-squeeze, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place a plaster and pads on it, and bind it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	However, its extremities that follow the elbow, and continue with it, do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If, however, it dislocates some day, then it is necessary that it be reduced and straightened according to what we have said, and as is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place a plaster, and pads, and a bandage on it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the sick person to adhere to peace and quiet until healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same treatment the humerus extremity is reduced when it is also separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	Concerning the reduction of the dislocation of the Humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	Know that the Humerus is not dislocated except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is that it is dislocated to the lower side of the armpit.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is that it is dislocated to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the Humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated posteriorly, because of the scapula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated anteriorly, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And very often it is dislocated and exits downwards towards the armpit: especially in those whose flesh is scant.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because it emerges quickly in them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	However, in those whose flesh is plentiful, it is the opposite of that, namely because it emerges with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some men through a blow or fall, and the humerus becomes inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is thought because of that, that it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, it is necessary that you test it until you stand on the certainty of it, and then proceed in its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And dislocation is recognized when it is directed downwards towards the armpit: and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy humerus.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a clear difference among them, and you will find a concavity in the head of the humerus, and under the armpit, at the touch, the head of the humerus is like an egg itself: and the sick person cannot bring their hand to their ear, nor move it in all motions.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards, then you will find a clear touch, nor is it hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And indeed, a simple reduction of this dislocation is accomplished when it is recent, or the patient is a child.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that the attendant raises his hand upwards.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your thumbs under his armpit, and lift the joint with strength upwards to its place: and the attendant should lift his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should place it below, for it quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If however it does not return by what we have said, and there have been many days since the dislocation occurred, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation administered which softens and soothes, such as if the roots of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and melilot are boiled in water, and administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the patient should be placed on his back: and a sphere and wool should be placed under his armpit, which should be equal between softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician should place his heel upon the sphere, and lift the shoulder head with strength, and pull the patient's hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another attendant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downwards: for it returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this method: and it is that you should have a man present who is taller than the patient, and he should stand on the side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's armpit: and lift his armpit upwards, until the patient is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another attendant should pull the patient's hand downwards towards his abdomen.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If however the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down; for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And it is also reduced according to another method: and it is that a long piece of wood should be fixed in the ground, whose head should be round in shape, like the sleeve of a mortar; which should not be thick, nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then, after soft cloths are placed on the head of the wood, the patient should be placed underneath; and the patient should be standing along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then, let his hand be extended downwards on one side, and let his body be extended on the other side with strength; for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If its reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this treatment: and it is that you should take a piece of wood whose length is the amount of two arms, and its width the amount of four fingers, and its thickness the amount of two fingers; to which there should be a round head, so that its entry into the depth of the hip is eased, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then soft cloths are bound over the round head, so that the wood does not injure the patient.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then place the wood under the patient's hip, so that the hand or arm is extended downward onto the wood; and tie the wood to the support, arm, and hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then place the arm over a step of a ladder across its width, and extend the hand downward, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint immediately enters [its proper position].
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When, therefore, its entry is completed in whatever way possible, then it is necessary that you place under the hip a sphere of equal size made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster, made from mill dust with frankincense and egg white, over the entire shoulder, as it revolves from above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then bind a decent bandage under the hip, and let the bandage revolve over the plaster from above, and bind his hand to his neck, and let it hang, and let his hand not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary that little food be given to the sick person, until the limb is strengthened; because this is quicker for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is to be applied after seven days, or five, and it is to be exercised with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is strengthened and does not soften, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If, however, the joint is dislocated many times, because of the moisture that happens to it, or because of another cause, then it is necessary that a cautery with three holes be administered to it, according to what has been said in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and constriction are applied to it repeatedly, and it is not strengthened, and it falls, and cannot be raised upward: then know that its nerves that are to the head of the shoulder, are already cut, or stretched, or softened: and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	The reduction of a dislocation that occurs towards the breast and nipple, or to the back, is done with pushing and pulling with the hands, until it returns, and the remaining constriction and treatment are administered to it until it is healed.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, heaviness occurs in the limb, and slowness in its movement, then let the sick person use the bath repeatedly, until that heaviness is eased, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of elbow dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and similarly returns with difficulty; and it dislocates indeed to all sides, and especially to the front or to the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you, for it lies under the sight and under the touch, whatever form it may dislocate into.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow with the sound one, it is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint hollows out, and the arm cannot double itself nor touch its shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary that you hasten and reduce the dislocation immediately, before a hot abscess occurs to it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot abscess occurs to it, its reduction becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not completely healed, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and causes more intense pain to them, and often death descends with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration, when it is of those that can be reduced, is that his hand should be extended with two hands, and his arm be stretched out, and the hands of the physician be above and below the elbow, and he should push the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palms, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or truly the dislocation is to the front: then it returns so that he doubles his hand with his hand, until he strikes with the base of his palm the elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a vigorous, very strong extension.  It is so that two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants also hold it so that it is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm should be revolved in every direction after a long doubled cloth, or a broad bandage, is wrapped around his hand.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil, so that it be of those things which aid in the lubrication of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should drive the joint with a forceful impulse until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary to place a plaster on it, containing astringency and desiccation with egg white; and a suitable bandage should be tied.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be released.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If therefore the joint is made firm in its place, then loosen the bandage from it, and leave it.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not being properly bandaged, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for a few days, until it is properly bandaged.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	However, if after the reduction of the joint, heaviness occurs and its condition is in motion, then apply moistening in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place on the joint the fat of a ram's rump.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then it should be bandaged, and leave it over it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it, and immerse him in a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When, therefore, he sweats, then rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then apply it again in one, and in a second, and in a third place using the ointment, upon entering the bath, until it is relieved.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place upon it a poultice of vaccine, moist, heated with butter, and bind it over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For it is thus soothed, and returns to its proper state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The joint between the arm and the hand, the Mahassem, is often dislocated.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Unlike other joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, speed is necessary in reducing its dislocation at the time of its happening, before the area becomes infected; or a hot abscess arises there.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is to place the weak hand's Mahassem on a table, and for the attendant to extend his hand; and for the physician to place his palm on the prominence of the joint, and to push it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider, if the palm has already receded to the back of the hand; then the invalid should place the back of his hand on the table at the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then let his hand's position be inside on the table, that is, the inside of his hand be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand falls upon the very prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If, therefore, it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then bind it with a soothing plaster for the abscess: and leave it, and do not repeat it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if it does not tolerate, nor can you effect its reduction, after the days have passed, the joint nonetheless remains according to its twist: and it does not harm the invalid anything, except that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything; then know that the nerves are severed, or bruised.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	Therefore, there is no remedy in it, except that it be cauterized near its location.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps that will not help anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore the Almahassem does not return, then place upon it the plaster which we have described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then let it be bound, and let it be left for five days; afterward, let it be unbound and left, and let the hand be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however its movement is deprived, and something serious occurs in it, then gently apply warm water and friction several times, until it is soothed.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	Concerning the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a finger is dislocated in any direction, or from its position towards the back of the palm, or the front of it, then extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the finger's head and suspend it towards the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it is made straight on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	Therefore, when it is night, bind it according to the same narration: and do not cease to loosen it by day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it by night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do that for a few days, until it is strengthened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And similarly do this with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand: and bind it to the part itself, and perform your first operation upon it until it is healed.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And similarly do this with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	Concerning the treatment of the dislocation of the spinal column.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the spinal column, or the neck, has a complete dislocation, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death hastens upon the sick person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of it is that the excretion of the sick person comes out without will, and he cannot hold it; and many times some of his limbs are softened, or his two legs, or his two arms, or one of them; or one vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is removed, which happens often in their removal to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore that which is removed to the back is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	However, the treatment for it is that you should consider then, if the gibbosity occurs from childhood: then there is no treatment for it, nor is there any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	However, in that which occurs from a fall, or a blow, or similar things to them, the ancients have already spoken of methods of treatment in lengthy language.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which much does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	However, I have already abbreviated from that, of which little excuses itself from much of it from my proximity to the intention: and by my exposition, in which I have exposed it, and I have formed its instrument in a different manner from that in which they have shown it and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in gibbosity which occurs on the anterior part, there is no remedy, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is made to both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless that which occurs in the back properly, with that which I narrate: and it is, that the infirm person be extended upon their face upon an even raised platform near the wall: and that damp straw be spread beneath them, so that their chest is not harmed.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then let a straight piece of wood, fixed in a hole in the ground, be placed at the end of the platform, approximately at the level of his head; and another piece of wood, approximately at the level of his feet, at the other end of the platform; and let an attendant hold the wood, and it not be firmly fixed in the hole.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And another attendant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then wrap around the head of the infirm person, and under his armpits, a soft, firm bandage: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood which is at his head: and tie it to it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tighten another bandage over his armpits, and over his knees, and at his heels.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and tie them to the other piece of wood which is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let each attendant extend the bandage to a part of the wood, and do not remove the two pieces of wood from their places where they are fixed; however, let them not be firmly secured, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician shall place his palms upon the vertebra with force, until it returns; or he shall place a board upon it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he ties his feet to the board until it returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If, however, it does not return by this treatment, then take a board whose length is approximately three arms' length.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And hollow out a space in the wall of which we spoke, which is near the sick person, into which the end of the board may enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board upon the vertebra.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician place his feet upon the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And let him pull tightly, until the vertebra is narrowed, and returns to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, work with a turning tool held in your hand: and it is as if you were to fix two pieces of wood, each the length of one arm, in the ground near the head of the sick person at the rear of the platform; and two pieces of wood near his head at the rear of the platform.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And let the distance between each piece of wood be one palm; and now a hole has been made in each place for the turning tool to pass through; and let each piece of wood be firmly fixed in the ground so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And let a round piece of wood be inserted; and the turning tool rotates the ligament through the two holes of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole in which a piece of wood is fixed, whose length is a palm together with what is turning; and in the other two pieces of wood there is similarly one of these.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligatures that you have tied around the chest of the sick person with the turning tool that is at his head; and the ligatures that you have tied around his legs with the turning tool that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then let a servant stand by each turning tool, who shall turn his hand with the cord by which the turning tool is rotated; and let the physician adjust the Spondylus, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the turning tool, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the Spondylus returns, and the place is leveled, then it is necessary to apply a drying plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, a piece of linen.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards, place on top of the plaster a small plank from a board, whose width is three fingers, or approximately so.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length the quantity that covers the hump, and over the healthy part of the Spondylus.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then bind it with the bandage we have described.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And let the sick person use light nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something of prominence remains in the place at the end of healing, then it is necessary that medicines which soften and soothe be administered, with the use of the board which we have described for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now a lead plate is administered on it.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs in the final part of the spine of the back, and a dislocation is suspected because of it, and that is the bone that is now prominent.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not appropriate to use this medicine with such a presumption, for perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Concerning the treatment of a dislocated Ancha.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	Know that dislocation of the Ancha joint, and the shoulder joint, does not occur except in a complete dislocation; nor does it happen to them what happens to other joints from a slight displacement and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the Ancha joint dislocates according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And most often it is dislocated inward; and little is it dislocated forward and backward.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment for its dislocation inward is this: because when you join the healthy leg of the weak person with the unhealthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the weak person is more prominent than the healthy one, and the weak person cannot bend his foot at the groin; and there is a place that follows the groin suppurated with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh has reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And the sign of someone who has experienced dislocation outward is that the symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of someone who has experienced dislocation forward is that the healthy leg extends to its full extent; however, he does not bend it without pain in the knee; and if he attempts to walk, he cannot step forward; and his urine is retained, and his groin becomes suppurated, and during walking, his heel is on the ground.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of someone who has experienced dislocation backward is that they do not extend the knee, nor can they bend it before bending the groin; and their leg is also shorter than the other; and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is at the place of the ilium.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction, however, of this type of dislocation is to consider, if the dislocation is old, that it has become established in the affected person.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you administer its reduction, and it remains in its position: then there is no cure for it at all.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary to make a presumption of it entirely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	However, in the case of someone whose dislocation is recent, and is of one of the four types of dislocation: then hasten to attempt to move the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it right and left; for perhaps it returns and does not need further treatment.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and to extend the leg from the lower part: either with his hands, or with a bandage, which is tied above the leg, above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand from above, so that he introduces his hands under the shin.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he should tie with a gentle bandage over the root of the thigh, and hold the other end of the bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let its extension be either from the anterior part of the groin to the part of the crotch, or from the posterior to the back part.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let the extension of all of them be simultaneous, until the sick person is lifted from the ground with his body, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	And this type of extension is a common type among the four types.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we have said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type to do what I will say about its own cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the proper reduction of it when the dislocation is inward, it is necessary that the sick person be laid on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he should place a bandage over the root of the thigh, in that which is between the head of the thigh and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the bandage upwards from the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the pubic bone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong attendant should take his arms, and lessen the bulky place of the sick person's thigh, and extend it outward with forceful extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For now it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this type is easier than the other types of treatment, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	However, if it resists you and does not obey your instructions with this treatment at all: then it is necessary that the two feet of the sick person be bound together with a strong, soft bandage, above the two heels and above the two knees; and let the length of each be from its counterpart a quantity of four fingers; and let the sick leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick person be suspended above a wooden beam, which is in the house; and let its length from the ground be the quantity of two arms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to support the head of the hip; and let another young man be suspended with the sick person; and let another young man, supporting the hip with strength, push, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	However, in its own return, when the dislocation is outward, it is necessary that the sick person lie on a raised platform, according to what we have described in the case of one with a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let a bandage be tied around his sick leg, and around his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then let two pieces of wood be placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let a piece of wood be placed in the middle of the platform, securely fixed; over which let damp cloths be wrapped, so that it does not harm the sick person; and let the wood be between his hips, so that it is not pulled downwards on extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then let each attendant pull in his direction, and the physician adjust the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it yields to the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place it on the board itself and press it, just as we said in the case of the hump, evenly.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick person lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the sick person's leg be pulled quickly: and it is according to this same account on the platform: and let the physician place the palm of his right hand on the sick person's groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then grasp it with the other hand, and with that grasp place it extended downwards towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear, then it is not necessary that the sick person be extended downwards, and be raised above the ground; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard object, as it is necessary, as is also done if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about his lying on his two hips: and it is on his face, and ligaments extended, as we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary that compression be applied with a board also to the place to which the joint emerges, when the reduction is completed as is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its return is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend the two legs of the sick person; and when you see them equal, and the sick person tightens his leg, and extends it without excuse, then know that the limb has now returned as it should; then join the two hips, and place a plaster, and bind with a bandage, that is, a roller; so that the hip is not moved to any part: and the sick person should adhere to rest for three, or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the bandage and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other; then if you see them equal in condition, then know that the dislocation is now firm; therefore dismiss the sick person to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening, then return and plaster it, and bind it according to your first binding; and leave it also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make him slow in walking on both [legs] for some days, until he is well strengthened.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	It is dislocated outward, inward, and downward, that is to say backward.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated forward.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And a sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the sick person to apply their leg to their thigh.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	If however it does not adhere to the thigh: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all the ways of its dislocation is that you should make the sick person sit upright, so that he/she may extend his/her leg if possible upon it, and adhere your back to his/her face, and place his/her foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make his/her knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over his/her knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm the two sides of his/her knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another attendant should extend his/her foot, until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg will adhere to the thigh with ease, not with effort.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then plaster it, and make the leg adhere to the thigh.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And let the infirm person not use walking for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	If, however, its reduction is refused to you, then administer a strong extension with bandages, whose description preceded in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the heel.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter Thirty-Four.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel sometimes is removed by a small displacement, and sometimes is dislocated completely.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, extending towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of its removal is easy to restore: and it is to be extended with ease with the hands, and aligned until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In its treatment, however, when it is dislocated completely, it is necessary that you make the infirm person sit upright: and let a strong minister hold him firmly from the back of his back, in the middle of it.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand his foot from its upper part, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot at the ankle.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the left two times.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and propel the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do that twice, as we have narrated.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then propel the front of the foot to the leg in the third turn, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns in one turn, or in two according to this method, and you see the foot straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation upon it, because it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however, the reduction of it with what we have narrated is prevented, then make the sick person lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a peg in the ground, so that it falls between his thighs; and you have now wrapped a cloth around him, so that it does not harm the sick person.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the attendant take his thigh; afterward let another attendant extend the foot, either with his hands, or with a bandage that is tied around the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let every attendant pull against the pulling of his counterpart; and let the peg stand between the two thighs of the sick person, holding him, so that his body is not pulled downwards during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the physician straighten the dislocation with his hands, and let another attendant hold the healthy leg downwards.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with speed.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore, when the dislocation returns, and its return is declared to you, then place a plaster and lint, and bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a bandage to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware or fear of the nerves that are above the posterior heel, so that the bandage is not too tight upon them and injures them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then leave it for two days, or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the bandage softens, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however he attempts to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not dissolve upon him, and corrupt, and not receive a cure after that.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If however a hot abscess occurs to him, then it is necessary that you administer to its abatement that which our previous account in another place has stated in relation to the treatment, and an embrocation, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Concerning the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and its treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated from them be straightened with slight extension without effort; and indeed this is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some of the dorsal knots of the foot, then it is necessary that the afflicted person place his foot on a level ground, or on a board; and he is standing as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and place your foot on that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then press it with your foot with force, until it returns and you see it now straightened, and no protrusion appears in the place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place a board under the sole of his foot, which takes the whole foot, having two ends.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a suitable bandage for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then unbind it, and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured from reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Concerning types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something of this sort occurs, and you attempt its treatment and restoration, often death ensues.  Therefore, it is not proper for anyone to undertake such treatment unless he is prudent in the long practice of the art, merciful, pious, slow, not rash, nor presumptuous; and that he employ, in the beginning, medicines which calm only hot abscesses; and that he leave the sick person to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for, salvation from destruction with a lessening of the illness, and in which something of hope appears.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, attempt its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If, therefore, the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that calms the abscess, and treat the wound with whatever suitable drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If, however, the dislocation is with a fracture, and separate bone protrusions occur, then attempt their removal, and do in that case what we have said in simple illnesses, from what has preceded concerning their places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And beware according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering the path of fear, according to what my previous teaching was to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more safe for your body among those in your time.
