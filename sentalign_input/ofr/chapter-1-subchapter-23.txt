When the humors prevail over the bronchial tubes of the lung, and especially when this comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be purged by laxative medicines;
afterwards make a cautery at the base of the throat, and be careful not to go down as far as the throat, and do not burn the heart but only a little.
Then make another cautery at the joint of the neck at the top of the spine, and let the cautery be what is called "clavile" of which we have the image before;
and treat the place as we have said before until it is healed.
