of the stone
We have already discussed in the section on types of stones, and their extraction together with medicines; and have explained the difference between stones generated in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stones one should operate by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis; and I will tell you plainly and briefly.
I say that the stone which is generated in the bladder occurs more often in children, and it is a sign that the liquid coming from the bladder resembles water in its clarity; and sand appears in it, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down often, and then becomes erect; and very often the base [of the penis] jumps/twitches; and the healing is easy in children up to four years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young men, in those who are between youth and old age; and the cure is easier for those who have large stones, than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the waste that is in the intestines.
For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and shake him and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes jumps from its high place; then have him sit prepared between your hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards; then search for it and touch it inside; if you feel the stone in the area, then hurry now to cut into the stone. 
And if it does not fall at the touch at all, wet your index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and insert it in his anus, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, guide it to the neck of the bladder; then press down on your finger, and push it aside where you intend to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and tell him to raise the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand to pull back the skin that is below the testicles in the area where the incision is made; then insert the cutting spatula, of which this is the form:
And cut between what is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but on the side of the left buttock; and it should be directly over the stone, and your fingers should always be in the anus, and the incision should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large; perhaps the finger that is in the anus presses it so that it jumps out without difficulty; and know that there are such stones where there are angles, and edges: it is difficult to remove; and there are some that are smooth, resembling an acorn, and round, which are easy to extract. 
For those then which have angles and edges, make the incision larger; and if it does not jump out, you must clamp down with forceps which are like a file at the tip, designed to grip the stone so that it does not escape; or you insert a subtle instrument curved at the tip underneath it; and if you cannot grasp it thus, widen the opening a little, and if the blood flows, staunch it with vitriol; and if there is more than one stone, push the largest to the neck of the bladder first, then cut down on it, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be sawn, and a larger wound made.
For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine constantly flows out so the wound cannot heal; but nevertheless, strive to pull it out, or to break it up with forceps, until you remove it in pieces; and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with frankincense and aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put a cloth soaked in oil and wine over it, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the inflamed area; then lay the patient on his side, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you unbind it, wash the area very well with oil and water, then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses develop in the wound and corrosion, and clotting of blood in the bladder, and because of this the urine is retained, which is recognized in such a way that blood comes out with the urine: then put your finger in the wound and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will corrode the bladder and rot it; then wash the wound with water and vinegar and salt, and help him in all the ways you know, until he is healed; and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs, and apply the medicines to the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and lodged there, and the urine cannot pass; treat him with what I said before, that you cut him many times, though one is excused from cutting by this treatment.
I have already tried this thus.
Take an iron drill of this shape and let it be three-sided, fixed in a firebrand:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder; then insert the drill into the penis gently, until it comes to the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side; then the urine will come immediately, then press your hand over what remains of the stone that is inside the penis.
It is then immediately broken, and comes out with the urine, and the patient is cured; and if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, tie a thread below the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the location of the stone between the two ties, then extract it, and untie the ties, and clean the clotted blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
