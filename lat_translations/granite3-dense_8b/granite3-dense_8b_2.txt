Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After having completed for you, O my son, this book, which is the last of the knowledge in medicine with its complement, and having reached the end of it through its expositions and his declarations, I wished to complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of operation, that is, surgery with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	For operation with the hand has been laid low in our region and in our time, and the knowledge of it has perhaps entirely perished, and its trace has entirely disappeared, and there remained from it only small descriptions in ancient books, which were changed by hand: and they incurred error and hesitation until its intentions were closed off and its vision was lengthened. It seemed to me that I should revive it with the arrangement of this Treatise in it according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation: and that I should come with the forms of Cauterii's tools, and the other tools of operation: since it is made from its declaration addition, and from its operation which is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	The reason why a good artisan of it with his own hand is not found in our time is this: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary for its author to be exercised before that in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of the members, and their forms, and their conjunction and separation, and have knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and sinews, and their number, and their egressions, and the pulses of the veins, and the quieting of them, and the exits of the places of them.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And on account of this Hippocrates said that a name with a name is much, and with work is few, and especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	Indeed, we have already spoken of that at the entrance of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since those who are not aware of what we have said about anatomy are not spared from falling into the error in which men perish: just as I have seen many of those who are formed from this science and boast about it without knowledge and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That is because I have seen a stupid doctor cut open a scrophulous abscess on the neck of a woman and cut some arteries in her neck: therefore the woman's blood flowed, until she died in her hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another doctor who presumed to remove a stone from a man who had grown old, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore he reached him and removed it with a piece of the bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Therefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And indeed I had already been called to remove it: and I saw from the size of the stone and the weakness of the man that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I have seen another doctor who received a bribe from a certain duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to the black eunuch who was with him, a fracture near the calcaneum in his leg: and the doctor hurried with his ignorance, and tied the fracture over the wound with bandages, and with strong bandaging, and did not let the wound breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he healed him according to his own desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then he sent him away for several days, and told him not to untie the bandage: and it stood thus until his leg became an abscess, and his foot, and he came to destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	Therefore I was called to him: and I hurried to untie the bandage: and following this, there was peace, and he escaped from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, corruption was already confirmed in the member, and I could not restrain it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Therefore, corruption ceased to wander in the member until it died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who pierced the carbuncular tumor, and it became ulcerated after days, until its evil was revealed to its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to approach it with iron at all, unless there is a member that can tolerate it, so that the whole of it is cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And because of that, my son, it is necessary for you to know that the operation with the hand is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation with which safety is associated, and the operation with which there is danger in many positions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already awakened in every place of this book, in which operation comes, in which there is fear and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to beware of that and abandon it, so that the fool does not find a way to speak and disgrace.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take the measure with solicitude and protection, and your infirm ones with facility and firmness, and use the better way leading to salvation and praiseworthy succession through the grace of God: and leave terrible difficulties of healing: and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that doubt may enter upon you in your faith and your benefit.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is rather remaining to your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	For Galenus already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not heal bad difficulties: so that you are not called bad doctors.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	Now however, this Treatise has been divided into three Chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter One.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Of the Cautery with Fire, and the Cautery with Sharp Medicine, arranged from beginning to end, including the forms of instruments and tools for cauterization, and everything necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter Two.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Of Cutting and Perforation, Bloodletting and Phlebotomy, and Wounds: and Extraction of Arrows, and similar things: and the entire Chapter arranged according to the forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter Three.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Of Restoration, and Dislocation, and Cure of Twisting, and similar things: arranged from beginning to end, including the forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part One.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Of the Jaw, and the Harm of Cauterization: and with which constitutions it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter One.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	However, before I remind you of the operation with it, it is necessary that I say about the quality of its Jaw, and the harm of that: and in which constitution it appears.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say therefore, that the speech about the quality of the Jaw of the Cautery, and its harm, is a long and subtle speech, a knowledge, and a hidden secret.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Also many wise men spoke about it, and they disagreed in it: and to me indeed it is insufficient by the words of them, fearing the lengthening.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say therefore, that the Cautery brings universally to every constitution, which is with matter, and without matter: excepting two constitutions, which are the constitution hot without matter, and the constitution dry without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In a warm and dry compound with matter, they separated.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	For some said that the cauterizing iron of the juvenile was in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of that, namely that the cauterizing iron is not suitable for the illness which is from warmth and dryness: because the nature of fire is warmth: and unsuitable is it, that one should be healed from the illness of warmth and dryness with warmth and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who said the opposite of that said: that by cauterizing, a cure is made for every illness of warmth and dryness which happens in the bodies of men: because when you compare the body of man, and its moistures, to the compound of fire, you find the body of man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I indeed say by his word: because from experiment he has shown me that many times.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	However it is not necessary to come to that, unless he who has already been tested, and exercised in the chapter of cauterization exercise last, and knows the diversity of human compounds, and the disposition of illnesses in themselves, and their causes, and the accidents of them, and the time of them.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	And from other compounds there is not upon you fear: and especially in illnesses which are cold and moist.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For now all physicians have gathered upon them: and they did not separate in cure with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And know you children, that from the secret of cure with cauterization with fire, and its goodness above cauterization with burning medicine is: because fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except to the member which is cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined with it, unless a little harm.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of medicine reaches as far as to extend from the body: and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing a member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, fire, due to its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed, we have now become aware of that through experiment, because of the length of service and study with the art, and position above truth of things: and for that reason I excuse myself from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, because it is not allowed for this my book, I would bring to you a secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies of its expulsion, which expels sufferings demonstrated by philosophical speech, which would be remembered by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And know, my sons, that they themselves disagree in the time when it is fitting to do cauterization, and they set a better time for the truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say, that cauterization is fitting at every time: because the accidental harm is sunk in the benefit, which is drawn with the cauterizer.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	Especially if cauterization is for pain from necessary pains, strong, urgent ones who do not tolerate delay: because it is feared that something evil may happen which is greater than the small harm that happens through delay.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And may not fall into your minds, my sons, that which they do not fear, namely that the common people and stupid physicians, namely that to the pain which is healed by cauterization, there is not always return: and they put this consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries moistures which are cause why pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, the excessive use of cauterizing can be detrimental to the medicine due to its speed of healing, its effectiveness, and its strong influence over the body. It is possible for the sickness to return at a later time according to the nature of the infirm person, the location of their sickness, and its strength. Also, it can be caused by the accumulation of excessive substances within their body, or from foods and similar causes that led to the application of the cauterization unless the sickness returns.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle sickness in a member with few excessive substances and moisture, such as a tooth cauterization due to pain and similar causes, is possible that this pain does not return in it.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	Indeed, the common saying that cauterization is the last of the medicines is correct, not as they intend in it: because they believe that there is no cure that corresponds with the medicine, nor with another after the fall of the cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	The matter is indeed the opposite of that, and their intention, that cauterization is the last of the medicines, is not so, unless when we administer modes of cure in some sicknesses, and those medicines do not correspond: then we administer at the end of the matter cauterization, and it corresponds: then it falls, that cauterization is the last of the medical arts, not according to the intention which the common people and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	The ancients indeed said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say this unless because of the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its substance: and they said that it does not make pus in the place of cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	However, it is not absolutely true that I have already proven and discovered that it does not work in certain bodies without other things.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And a cautery with it is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you put the cautery into the fire from gold, it is not indicated to you when it is burned according to the amount that you want, because of the redness of gold: and when it approaches the heat, and if you add more to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the craftsman falls from that into the occupation: and for that reason, the cautery with iron is made by us faster and closer, from straightness to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And indeed, I have already arranged this Chapter on Cautery, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from head to foot, so that those seeking it may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the head at the collarbone.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is applied to the dominion of moisture and cold over the brain: which two are causes of sweat, and multitude of discharges of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleep, and pain of the teeth, and pain of the throat: and universally all kinds of distress, which occur from cold, such as paralysis, and sweats, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar diseases to those distresses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is, that you order the sick person: to be emptied at first with a cleansing solution, head three nights, or four, according to what requires the power of the sick person, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then instruct him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit between your hands in a square position, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your thumb on the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whenever your middle finger reaches that spot, mark the location with a pen.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the cauterizing iron of olive oil: its form is as follows.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it on the marked spot with the pen, with a downward movement, as your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it back.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly withdraw your hand, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that the amount of bone from the skull is equal to the amount of alkali or zeuberg, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with the same iron, or with another if it is cooled: until you see the bones that I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink the solution with the wound, and place it on the spot: and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the salt water drunk on the wound on butter, and leave it on the spot until the scab of the fire is destroyed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the ointment tetrapharmacon until it is healed.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said that the more the wound remains open, the more pus is emitted: therefore it is better and more healing.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized until the bone: and the cauterizing iron should be held until something of the density of bone is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is scraped after what was burned from the bone, then it is cared for.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	Some say that when the cauterizer reaches the last part, it should be pressed against the bone until an impression is made in the form of a crescent: or with an instrument like that which women place between their teeth for the purpose of learning the alphabet: and they believe that vapors from the head will escape through this place, and the wound will remain open for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it should be dressed until it heals.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	To me, however, these two kinds of cauterizer do not appear at all except in certain men according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And it is better to leave it alone with its own health, in my opinion.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head becomes weakened from the solution of its natural continuity, just as we have shown in other members: and especially when the head of an invalid is weak by nature: and indeed the first kind of cauterizer is more saving and better for me, and I use it: therefore, work with it in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the head in the pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is chronic pain in the whole head, and it is prolonged in the invalid, and he uses hemlock, and coals, and head-cleansers, and oils, and plasters:
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	Especially if he has already been cauterized with the one cauterizer which we have mentioned, and does not apply anything from them: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head of the invalid is strong by nature, and is not weak, and has found a violent cold: then cauterize with another cauterizer under it slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it on top of all the horns of its own head with the cauterizer, so that the skin does not pass through, and a quantity of bone is exposed, as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize it with a single cauterizing iron at the back of its head, in the place called the "uas": and it is the location where the windpipe is placed: and raise your mat (or blanket) in this, and do not uncover its mouth.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For indeed it has found a remedy for that very severe pain, and different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this cauterizing iron in its place: and it must be a cauterizing iron by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of its head more subtly with the cauterizing iron by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	ON THE METHOD OF CAUTERIZING IN HEMICRANIA, BOTH WITH A BURNING MEDICINE AND WITH AN IRON.
Caput IIII.	HEAD IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	WHEN PAIN AND SORENESS OCCUR IN A PART OF THE HEAD, AND THE PAIN EXTENDS UP TO THE EYE, AND IS CLEANSED WITH REMEDIES FOR CLEANSING THE HEAD, AND THE REST OF THE CURE IS ADMINISTERED, AS I SAID IN THE DIVISIONS OF ILLNESSES, AND IT DOES NOT HEAL ALL OF IT: THEN CAUTERIZATION IS DONE IN TWO WAYS: EITHER CAUTERIZATION WITH A SHARP MEDICINE BURNING, OR WITH AN IRON.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	BUT THE CAUTERIZING IRON WITH A SHARP MEDICINE BURNING IS, THAT YOU TAKE ONE Tooth of garlic, AND REMOVE ITS SHELL, AND CUT OFF ITS EXTREMITIES FROM BOTH SIDES.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	THEN CUT THE PLACE OF THE PAIN AT THE TIME WHEN THE BROAD LANCET IS USED, UNTIL THERE IS A LOCUS UNDER THE SKIN, IN WHICH THE TOOTH IS CAPTURED.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	THEN INSERT IT INTO ITS SKIN, UNTIL IT IS HIDDEN: THEN STRAP OVER IT WITH A PIECE OF CLOTH IN DECENT CONSTRICTION, AND LET IT GO FOR FIFTEEN HOURS, THEN DISSOLVE IT, AND EXTRACT THE GARLIC, AND LET HIM REST FOR TWO DAYS, OR THREE: AFTER THAT, PUT ON IT BANDAGE SOAKED IN BUTTER, UNTIL THE PLACE BECOMES PUS: THEN CARE FOR IT WITH OINTMENT UNTIL IT HEALS.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you wish to do this with certain burning medicines, which I have written about in my twelfth treatise on Burning Medicaments.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	However, the cauterization of that with iron is done in this manner.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cauterization with fire, which has this form.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the Clavil, because its form is like the form of a claw, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it is a small elevation.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it on the spot and hold your hand: and you will turn the iron gradually with speed: and the quantity that is burned from the thickness of the skin, is like its middle.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, does not burn and there is no loss of blood flow.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then take the wound and soak it in salt water, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then place the wound with butter: afterwards care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second edge of the small cauterizer.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And avoid the incision of the artery in this hemicrania, not the ancient one properly.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in the ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating the hemicrania, with what we said about the previous cure, and what we said in the divisions of ailments, and it does not benefit from the cure: and you see from the ailment, that what we said about the first cauterization with medicine, or with the cauterizer with fire, does not suffice for it, then it is necessary to burn the small cauterizer, until it becomes white after the sign of pain with a line, whose length is the middle of a finger, or something like that: and place your hand halfway, and hold it until you cut the artery, and go through to the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the jawbone, which moves during chewing, so as not to be burned by the side or the nerve that moves it, from which a spasm may occur.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And let this be over the guard and the precaution against the flow of blood from the severed artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For in its severing there is fear, and especially for him who does not know what it does, and is not studious or experienced: and he leaves the operation with it first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I will come with the remembrance of the management of the flow of blood from the artery according to its own manner and in its own place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the pain that this cauterizer does not suffice for him, and you see the weak body bearing the cauterizer in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, take care of the wound until he is healed.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, administer the cauterizer which we said in the chapter of extracting the artery with a cauterizer having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more fitting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and it is cured with solutions, and the rest of the cure as we said in division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and this is what is called a prick, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then pricks with it after its ignition around the ear entirely, as it is turned: or around both, if the pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And withdraw yourself with the cauterizer a little from the root of the ear after you have marked the places with the cauterizer: and let the quantity of the cauterizer be ten pricks in every ear, and about that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then treat the affected areas until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	On the method of cauterizing in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	The torture that is cured with cauterization is only from the types that occur from phlegm, as we said in the divisions of illnesses.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And the absence of cauterization of the type that occurs from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you treat this type of torture with honey, and capitpurges, and gargarisms, and your cure does not help, then it is necessary for you to cauterize the sick person with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and second a little lower from his time, and third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterization on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	Because softening does not occur except in the part that appears healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is to cauterize the sick person with the cauterization directly at the tip of the upper ear under the horn of the head a little: and another in the time: whose length is according to the length of the thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And place your hand with the cauterization until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of the cauterization, and it is a species from a knife, whose form was mentioned before: but it is not too sharp, as you see: and it is necessary that the knife be a little too thick.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then treat the affected areas with what preceded until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	On the method of cauterizing in old apoplexy.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy is old, and you treat it with what we said, and your medication does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations on all the horn of his head, and with the cauterization in the middle of his head, as we said, and with the cauterization in the back of his head, according to what preceded: and the method of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Even cauterization is performed with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and it is more final.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then it is treated, with what preceded it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Obliuione.	On the method of cauterization in Oblivion.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Oportet ut in potu dentur in primis infirmo hyerae magnae, et pillulae mundificantes cerebrum.	It is necessary that in the drink first give great hiera powder, and purifying pills cleanse the brain.
Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the head of the sick person all over, and place on his occiput the plaster of synapi described in the treatise on plasters: and place it several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For this is indeed the method of cauterization: and do it according to order, as I said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If therefore he is healed by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	If not: then perform three cauterizations on the posterior part of his head, which are descending from the superior part of the head down to the lower part of the eye: and place between every cauterization the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then treat the cauterization, with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	But if you wish an addition, and the sick person is tolerating this: then perform cauterization on the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	If you wish an addition: then cauterize him over two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then treat him, until he is healed: and let the cauterization be oily according to the form which was previously given.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Paralisi, et mollificatione.	On the method of cauterization in paralysis, and softening.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Oportet ut procedas in mundificatione capitis cum hyeeris, et cum eo quod diximus.	It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hiera, and with what we said.
Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then shave the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize him in the middle of his head, and with a cauterization on every horn of his head, and on the back of his neck, and three on the spines of his neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If you lack the ability to tolerate many of these softening methods for the body and are weak, and the pain is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries on the spines of the back, and the last one with a cauterizer until it burns the most of its skin, and raise your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then care for it until it heals: and thus cauterize with oil.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Epilepsia.	On the method of cauterizing in epilepsy.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Non Cauterizatur epilepticus, nisi ille cuius epilepsia est ex phlegmate.	An epileptic should not be cauterized unless he is the one whose epilepsy is from phlegm.
Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore it is necessary to cleanse his brain first with vinegar, and with the rest of the cure which we mentioned in division: when he is weak, or is not able to bear the taking of medicines.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	But if it is a child who does not bear medicines, then the gargle is administered, and cleansing mastications of the brain are given before many days with good nutrition.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then shave his head, and then cauterize him with a cauterizer in the middle of his head, according to what preceded in method: and with another cauterizer in the back of his head, and on every horn of his own head with a cauterizer.
Quod si infirmus fuerit fortis, et fuerit tolerans, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauteriis, quae dixi in habente paralisim, et mollificationem corporis super spondiles colli, et spondiles dorsi: et sit Cauterium oliuare secundum modum qui praecessit.	But if he is weak and strong, and is able to bear it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I said in having paralysis, and softening of the body on the spines of the neck, and the spines of the back: and the cauterizer should be oily according to the method which preceded.
Si autem infirmus est puer, tunc pone cauterium subtile, secundum hunc modum.	But if he is weak, then place the thin cauterizer in this way.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Melancholia.	On the method of cauterizing in melancholy.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Quando caussa melancholiae sunt humiditates corruptae, et phlegma grossum, tunc cauteriza ipsum Cauteriis, quae diximus in habente paralisim.	When the cause of melancholy is corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned in one having paralysis.
Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of humors flowing down to melancholy, and there is a weak moist body, then give him a drink that cleanses his brain, according to what preceded in division: then shave the sick head, and make afterwards a well-made tortellini from linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then place it in the middle of the head: and the sick one sitting squarely held from every part.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the liniment.
Et est dignius ex butyro ouium antiquo.	And it is more fitting from old butter.
Et calefac ipsum super ignem calefactione temperata mensura, quam toleret digitus, quando intromittitur in ipsum.	And warm it gently over a fire with measured heat, which the finger could bear when inserted into it.
Deinde euacua ipsum in medio capitis eius in circulo, et dimitte ipsum donec infrigidetur.	Then evacuate it in the middle of his head in a circle, and let him go until he is cooled.
Fac illud infirmo omni hebdomada semel, cum reliquo regimine eius bono, donec sanetur.	Do this for the sick one once a week, with good management of his other affairs, until he is healed.
Aut si uis, cauteriza ipsum faciendo puncta parua plurimum eius, praeter quod teneas manum cum cauterio: imo sit odorando.	Or if you wish, cauterize it by making small points as much as possible, except that you hold the hand with the cauterizer: indeed it should be smelling.
Haec enim species cauterii humectat cerebrum cum qualitate.	For this kind of cauterization humidifies the brain with quality.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, aut adipe gallinae.	Then place on it a wet cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aqua descendente ad oculum.	¶ On the manner of cauterizing in water flowing down to the eye.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando declaratur tibi principium aquae in oculo per signa, quae dixi in diuisione, tunc incipe et pota infirmum, cum eo quod mundificet caput eius.	When the beginning of water is declared to you in the eye by signs which I said in division, then begin and give the sick one a drink with it that cleanses his head.
Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And guard him from all moistures, and make him sit in the bath, on fasting days for several days.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then instruct him to cut off his head and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize it over the two temples with two cauteries, if there is an onset of water in both eyes at once: or from one side, if there is an onset of water in one eye: and cut off all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterization be long in the width of the temples: and beware of blood flow.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	If you see anything from it, then cut it off immediately with any possible medicine: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and their cutting, and caution against blood flow.
Et quandoque cauterizatur in ceruice, sub duobus ossibus, duobus cauteriis ultime productis.	And sometimes it is cauterized on the neck, under two bones, with two last cauterizations produced.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lachrymis antiquis.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the eyes of olden times.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Quando lachrymae oculorum sunt antiquae, assiduae: et sunt super uenas, et arterias quae sunt in manifesto capitis exterius, uerificatur quod illud est ex superfluitatibus frigidis, phlegmaticis: tunc cauteriza cauterio eodem quod narraui in incaeptione aquae descendentis, cauterio in medio capitis, et duobus cauteriis super duo timpora, et duobus cauteriis in ceruice sub duobus ossibus.	When the tears of the eyes are olden, persistent: and they are on the veins, and arteries that are in the manifest exterior of the head, it is verified that that is from superfluities cold, phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cauterization that I told in the onset of water descending, cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations over the two temples, and two cauterizations in the neck under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if you need additional, then cauterize it on every side of the eye carefully, over the extreme of the eyebrow with a small cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in foetore Nasi.	Concerning the method of cauterizing in the nostril discharge.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quando tu medicaris illud, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert medicatio: tunc propera, et da in potu infirmocochias tribus noctibus: deinde rade caput eius, et cauteriza ipsum cauterio medio, cum cauterio oliuari.	When you treat it, with that which we said in the division, and there is no remedy: then hasten, and give in the weak medicine for three nights: then cut off his head, and cauterize it in the middle with a fat cauterization.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio clauili duobus cauteriis, super duo supercilia sub capillis parum.	Then, cauterize the eyelid with a cautery hook, applying two cauteries, one above each eyebrow, just beneath the hair.
Et custodite ab arteria, ne incidas eam.	And guard against the artery, lest you cut it.
Et haec est forma cauterii Clauilis.	And this is the shape of the cautery hook.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in mollificatione Palpebrae.	On the method of cauterizing for relaxation of the eyelid.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Quando mollificatur Palpebra oculi ab aegritudine, aut humiditate: tunc cauteriza Palpebram cauterio uno, cum hoc cauterio lunari.	When the eyelid is relaxed from pain or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery and this lunar cautery.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above each eyebrow a little with two cauteries in every part: and they should be extended from both temples: and the length of all the cauteries should be according to the length of the eyebrows: and do not let your hand touch the cautery, but according to the quantity that burns the third eyelid.
Et haec est forma cauterii secundum hunc modum cauterii lunaris.	And this is the shape of the cautery according to this method of the lunar cautery.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	On the method of cauterizing the eyelid when hairs point towards the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery in this case is according to two methods: either a cautery with fire: or a cautery with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In the cautery with fire, however, instruct the sick person before it, so that he may let go of his hairs, if it is from those who remove them, until they are extended and evened out.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if they point at his birth: then close his eyes with a bandage, so that they may not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and evened out, then place the head of the sick person in your lap: then mark on the eyelid with a hot iron, a sign that it is according to the figure of myrtle leaves: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a moistened cotton pad on the albumen or on the mucilage of psyllium over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then apply a cauterizing iron with this shape.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the shape you indicated gradually in several strokes, until the surface of the skin is burned, which appears like the figure of a myrtle leaf, entirely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your work's health is that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs raised at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So wash your hand then, and let it rest for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a cotton pad with butter on it over it until the eschar is removed.

Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	When therefore the bite is quieted, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid raised, as it is raised with contraction with fire, or with incision, it is good: and if not, then repeat on it from the medicine on the place where it does not imprint the medicine, and does not stain, until your operation equals, and the eye contracts.

Let it be concave, like the form of the pen feather of a quill from one end, with which the cauterizing iron is made: and if you wish it to be piercing up to the other end, and if you wish it to be upwards, then test thus.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this concave is better for your work.

When the toothache is due to coldness, or there is fever in it, or worms, and no cure is found with medicines: then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with butter: or cauterization with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	But cauterization with butter is, so you take calf's butter, and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a vessel.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	Then take a cloth, and cover it over the end of the tooth.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	Then submerge it in the boiled butter: and place it on the painful tooth quickly, and hold it until it cools: then repeat it several times, until the power of fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	And if you wish, submerge a cloth, or a rag in cold butter, and place it on the painful tooth: and place a hot iron on it, until fire reaches the depth of the cavity of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But cauterization with fire is, so you direct it to a tube of air, or an iron tube.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	And there should be something thick in its body, so that the sharpness of fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	Then cauterize with fire, whose form will come: and place it on the tooth: and hold your hand until the cauterization cools.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Perform this procedure several times, as the pain will be alleviated either on that same day or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	And it is necessary for the sick person to fill his mouth with good charcoal and hold it for one hour, then spit it out.

When Strophuli are caused by phlegm, and by cold humors, and they do not obey the digestive process through medicines, and you want to quickly promote their digestion: then use a flat cauterizing iron, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	Having two open ends, so that smoke comes out from the cauterizing iron through the other end: and place it on the abscess once, and twice if you need to, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	If the abscess is small: then place the cauterizing iron according to the size of the abscess.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	Then let it go for three days, and place on it a compress soaked in an infusion, until the burn caused by the fire is removed.

Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When it happens, and you want to know if that abscess is in the liver flesh, or in its tunic: then if it is in the liver flesh, it attacks the weak with pain, and there is gravity without sharpness: and if it is in the tunic of the liver, with pain there is very strong sharpness: and you see already, because its cure has tired out the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore it is necessary that the weak person lie down on his neck.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the shape of the place of the abscesses with the cautery: then burn the cautery that resembles a ray.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize with that cautery one, until the whole skin is burned, and it reaches the intestines, until all the pus comes out: then cure him with the cure of the wounds, until he is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary to use this cautery species, unless whose study in the art of medicine is prolonged: and through whose hand these illnesses with trial several times: then for he dares on this operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	It is indeed better to let her go, with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	On the method of cauterizing in Pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said, a cautery with the roots of Aristolochia should be applied to cold Pleurisy in this manner.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is that you should take from the dry roots of Aristolochia, a longer root, which is found among them, and it should be as thick as the size of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and burn it in the fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize it with a single cautery in that which is between the continuation of the backbone with the neck, and two small cauteries under the chin slightly declining to the part which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth rib declining to the backs a little: and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and with another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And with three cauteries from the backs: one in that which is between two spatulas: and with two cauteries from two sides of the chest, lower cauterie which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary to press your hand with the cautery, but rather it should be in plain sight of the skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And indeed some ancients said that from men there are those who use a cautery from a similar iron rod: and they burn, and they put it inside in that which is between the ribs, until it reaches with it to the apostem, and the pus comes out: as we said in the apostem of Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cautery there is from fear, that either he dies weak immediately, or it happens in the place of a fistula, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32 on the method of cauterizing the spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you are treating a splenic affliction, since as we mentioned earlier, the cure lies in dividing the afflictions, and your treatment does not succeed, then cauterization of it is done in three ways, all of which are correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of which is to perform three or four cauterizations along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the liver cauteries, whose figure precedes it.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between each cauterization a thickness of the digit's breadth, or a little more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cauterization be as we mentioned in the cauterization of the liver equally.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not press your hand against the cauterizer: and let the patient be weak and lying on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method of cauterization is: to have the cauterizer with two wounds, as we mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the humerus: and raise the skin which is on the spleen directly, where the elbow of the weak left arm reaches: and let your elevation be according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizations fall according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burning wounds, until you penetrate the skin from the other side: then remove the cauterizer: so there are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with another cauterizer having three wounds.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then care for the cauterizer after you have released it, to emit pus for many days: for it is more helpful than all the other things that preceded from the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	Chapter on the method of cauterizing in hydrops.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterizer does not fall into hydrophobia unless properly trained.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you treat hydrophobia with the methods of cure that we mentioned in the division, and do not combine the cure, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient four times around the umbilicus, and with a cauterizer on the stomach, and another on the epar, and one on the spleen, and two cauterizers after the back between the spines, and one in direct pectoris, and another in direct stomachi: and let the depth of the cauterization be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then dismiss the cauterizer open, so that it emits pus over a long period of time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not remove the sick person from treatment after cauterization with him, for it is necessary that two intentions be gathered to him: and he will hasten to him with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the cauterizer with which the belly is cauterized should be closed, according to its previous form: and the form of the one with which the back is cauterized should be olive-oil-like, according to its previous form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	On the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When abscesses form in hydrophobia and are filled with yellow water: then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nocrati, which is between the auricular and anular: and lift your hand with the cauterizer, and do not twist it: then lift your hand: and do not rub it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the yellow water flows out, and the cauterizer should be according to this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauterizers on both legs, and let the cauterizer be according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below it, around the middle of the leg: and two cauterizers on every hip: and dismiss the cauterizer open without treatment for a long period of time: so that some water flows out from it: then cure him with the rest that we said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	On the method of cauterizing in the operation of ventroscopy.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When there is a dissolution of the belly due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines: and it is cured with the methods of cure, but not healed: and you see an infirm person bearing a cauterizing instrument of excessive power, then cauterize him with a great cauterizer on his stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circle cauterizer, and four cauterizers in the circumference of the umbilicus, with the subtle cauterizer: and with the cauterizer on the alcatin above the alhosos, or with two cauterizers.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see excessive moistures, and the infirm person bearing that, then cauterize him with a cauterizer on the pectin, and with the cauterizer on every ilium: and perhaps add two small cauterizers near the great one on the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For there is a cure that progresses, whose remedy does not stray.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	On the method of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are from thick humors, cold, or corrupted moistures, and are cured with what we said in division, and not with a complete cure: then cauterize with three cauterizers on the lower spondyle of the back slightly triangularly, and with the cauterizer under the umbilicus as if by two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see his face swelling, then cauterize him on the stomach with a great cauterizer, according to what preceded: and with the cauterizer on his Epar, and another on his Splen, with the subtle cauterizer: and leave the cauterizer open for a time: then cure him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Of the method of cauterizing an ulcer after its excision.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you excise an ulcer, then apply a cauterizing iron that resembles a needle.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the burning iron into the excised ulcer: and your last hand, until the cauterizing iron reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flowed, do it once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If therefore the ulcers are many, then cauterize each one with a cauterizing iron according to what we have narrated.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with that which heals them from the ointment until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cauterizing iron over the skin, it is more painful.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Of the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the incision and operation that we have narrated in its place, and is afraid of it, perhaps he will be healed with a cauterizing iron.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When therefore a fistula occurs and is deep, pus flows from it, and corrupt moistures.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore what is more fitting is to probe it with a thin needle.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the quantity of its depth with the needle.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply a cauterizing iron that resembles a needle.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert the burning iron into the fistula and the quantity in which it entered the clod.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeat the iron over it, until those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to the quantity of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself from burning of the nerve, if it is there, or great wound: or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder, or to the body of the intestine, then guard yourself from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do that, unless when the fistula is in a fleshy place: and you think, because it is not piercing.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed, and the materials are cut off from it, and it remains like this for a long time: then you know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the materials are not cut off from it, then you know that it is piercing, or there is a rotten bone in its depth, or something like that from those: whose memory will come back to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the kidneys.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When it happens in the kidneys pain from cold, or from thick ventosity, and is reduced because of the weakness of the breath, then it is necessary to cauterize that above almethenum above those kidneys, with a cauterizer on all the kidney with a clamp, whose memory has already been mentioned.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize it again in the second one in that almethenum.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why three straight lines will come.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore they will be more in the joint.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	¶ On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When it happens in the bladder weakness, and mollification from cold and moisture, until it does not retain infirm urine, then cauterize that in the lower part of the scrotum over the bladder, where the hairs begin to grow, and with a cauterizer from the right scrotum, and another from the left of that: and the length of that cauterization on the side is according to the quantity of the little finger: and cauterize it with a cauterizer on the lower back, or with two cauterizers, if you need that one: and it is according to what has already been mentioned the clamp cauterizer.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	On the method of cauterizing the womb.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and pregnancy is prevented, and the menstruation is corrupted, and the provocation of them is delayed, and pain occurs when they come, then it is necessary to cauterize with three cauterizations around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cauterization on the lower back, or with two cauterizations: and let the cauterizing instrument be sharp.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	On the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture is poured into the anus and becomes a cause of its exit from its place: and the sign of this is that the leg is lengthened over the other when they are compared together: and the location of dislocation is found to be empty in that place.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the infirm one over the anus of that person with a similar cauterization circle: after you sign with the encaustic in the circumference of the anus, as it rolls: and so that the anus falls in the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the cauterizing instrument be of a shape that precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cauterizing instrument is not present to you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, with a large olive cauterization: and let the depth of the cauterizing instrument be according to the thickness of the skin of the whole.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for him until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	On the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the anus and the cause of this is cold and moisture: and the infirm one is cured with him, as we said in division, and the cure does not reunite, and it is renewed: then it is necessary to dissolve the infirm one from gross humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization depends on two methods: either with a cauterizing instrument burning with medicaments, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	A cauterizing instrument with fire is done in many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of these methods is to cauterize on top of the pivot stone of his anchor, in a triangular shape, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them either deep or shallow.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And let there be space that is the thickness of each cauterization according to the size of a finger: and let the cauterization be oily.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	Sometimes, however, the cauterization is done in the middle on top of his anchor.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Therefore there are four cauterizations.
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose preceding form is in the cauterization of anchor dislocation, one: so that it contains the whole anchor.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the skin entirely.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain adheres to his anchor and does not extend up to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	But if it extends up to the hip and leg, then cauterize him with two cauterizations on the hip, on the place where he indicates the weakness, in which is the pain, and with your cauterizing instrument on the thigh four fingers towards the sylvestern part: and let the cauterization be knife-like.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	But if he indicates that the pain extends up to near the toes of his foot, then cauterize him there where he indicates with your cauterizing instrument, three, or four, or more, if it is needed by him.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	If there is an indication of pain under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize that spot with a single knife.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And always remember in all your cauterizations, so that you do not burn the nerves or a large artery, and thus cause harm to the weak body, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I myself have seen one and another from those who cauterized above the knee, and ended up in cauterization, and the leg became swollen, until a tumor followed the foot, and it was perforated entirely, and the entire foot rotted: then diagnosis of the abdomen occurred, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in both parts at once, cauterize each according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men said in cauterization of the ankle, which is this method.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar spatula from iron, whose diameter is the middle of the palm: and it should be at its opening according to the thickness of the nucleus of the finger, or slightly less: and inside that spatula there should be a third spatula.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there should be a space that is between each spatula by the thickness of the nodule of the thumb: and they should be open on both sides: and their height should be like a nodule, or two nodules: and make them a handle from iron properly fitted in the spatulas.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then it should be heated in the fire until it glows red, and throw sparks: then it should be placed on a pillow of the weak ankle lying on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauteries in one stroke.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply plasters with butter: and let the open wound heal over many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says, "In this manner of cauterizing, my son, we have been very little used, because of the fear of its appearance: and therefore, because we find few who are willing to wait over it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, it is from good cauterizations that he who suffers and finds with him the place of his.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterizing iron with medicaments is burned, so that you make two smae having a perforated ring, into which the card of his door descends from the air, or iron, length of the wall: whose height they are two knots, or as themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there is space that is between both quantities of thickness of the finger, and they are open below and above: and there is that they contain themselves to each other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then lay it on the anchorage of a pitcher, sick lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand on the anchorage of a pitcher much.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles from hot water, which is heated with fire a little, and hold it for a certain amount of time: and the sick bears its bite, and its burning, for he found its bite like fire, until the bite rests.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then clean your hand with the tool, and remove hot water from the anchorage all with sweet water: then let it rest for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place on it butter, until the blackness of the burning is removed: and let it rest for several days, and drain from it pus.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	It is the last remedy for a wound.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg: make a splint in that which contains water, as you did in the equal anchor.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unburned lime each one part of the same weight: grind both, and put them in a new pot, whose lower part is perforated with a small hole of the same size as the radius: and put another glass pot under the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime from sweet water, which covers both through your finger: after which you press it with your hand good compression: and leave the pot, until the sharp water flows down the lower part of the glass pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all that water and pour it over another lime: and cook, until it is renewed.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	For this will then be very strong acid, which is administered in many medical operations, and in the cauterization of the remaining limbs.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	Because it performs the operation of its fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the medical remedies with which the anchors are cauterized, also as tesserae, and melted anacardium, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed. ¶
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And indeed Galen himself related in his writings the cure of a certain man from ancient times, by which he was cured of the pain of the anchor and the sciatic vein: and praised it very much.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said that it did not need other cure, and because he was healed from one vice, until he related, because perhaps he had entered the bath carried, and came out of it already healed.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is to be taken from the fresh green of seitaragi: and if it is not found, take the dry, recent one, and pound it thoroughly with a little fat, and place it on the anchor where the pain is, or in the leg, or in the hip: and tie it, and let it remain for three hours, or according to the quantity that the sick person feels sedation of the inflammation.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then immerse him in a bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When therefore his body becomes moist, immerse him in a chair.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain retreats, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And know that one should not use a cautery with these remedies, unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that, when donkey dung is applied with it to the sciatic nerve, it brings him relief: and a cautery is made in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	Take wool, and pour oil on it old, and place it on the deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take donkey dung dry, and burn it in fire, until it becomes coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it on the wool, and let it go, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat that.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not therefore stop doing it, until the sense reaches above the remedy up to the hip, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cautery is called the cautery of Vaccinium.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	§ On the cauterization of the pain of the back.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, or by accident, or by blow, or by excessive evacuation, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and wet matter: and cautery does not fall, except in this kind alone, which is made from the infusion of cold matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after evacuation of the sick with foul-smelling pills and similar ones, they should be placed on the back where the pain is, three lines according to the width of the sick person's spine, after which signs with a hot iron in every line five cauterizations, or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the sick person by its virtue: and let the cauterization be made with a cauterizing needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterize three times or four with a middle cauterizing needle, in this form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	On the method of cauterizing in the beginning of gibbosities.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This affliction often happens to small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its beginning in children is: that which happens to him a tightness on his breathing and movement: and it is found in the last rib of the back and its knots, which already begins to rise above the other ribs.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When therefore you see that and wish to do it, then cauterize that with a cauterizing needle which is a circle in this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he should take the cauterizing needle over every part of the rib equally: and if you wish to cauterize around the rib with a pointed cauterizing needle two lines, or three: and they should be close together.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for the place, until he is healed with that which we said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And beware, that you do not give the cauterizing needle in gibbosity, which is made in a spasm of the nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	On the method of cauterizing in gout, and pains of the joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When pains of the joints are from cold humors, which are poured out to each limb of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is according to the custom of physicians, that they call that gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When, therefore, podagra (gout) of a cold cause is being treated and the pains are not removed, then the burning instrument will remove them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is, that after the evacuation around the joint of the foot, with many burnings, the burning instrument should be olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you lack to make pricks on the face of the foot, then make with the burning instrument a prick.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	But if the pains ascend up to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then burn it over all the knee with three burnings, or four from every part, with this same burning instrument the Hamstring.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	But if you need more of this burning instrument to you, then burn it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand with the burning instrument, but rather it should be about the thickness of the skin only.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	But if the pains ascend up to the knees and back: then give what we said from the burning instrument in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	But if the pains are only in the hands: then make pricks around the wrist, as two lines turn.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	But if there remains from the pains in the fingers: then make pricks on each joint of the finger, and on the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	But if the pains ascend up to the elbows, or shoulders: then burn both from every part.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not evacuate the weak from good regimen, from receipt of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if good regimen is made, and the phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this burning instrument.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	¶ On the method of burning in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LXIV is not present in the provided medieval Latin translation of Albucasis' 10th century Arabic textbook on surgery.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestine or bladder descends to the testicle, and it is near the beginning: then you should order the sick person to abstain from eating on that day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And let him use laxatives so that feces may descend from his intestines.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him to hold his breath until the bladder or intestine appears.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then let him reduce it with your fingers, and mark with a hot iron under the rupture on the edge of the lip, with a sign whose extremity is similar to the middle of a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then let him heat the iron, whose shape is as follows, until it becomes white, and then throw sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then let him reduce the intestine or bladder to its original shape.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let him place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not exit: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed under it a pillow, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds the hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then let him place the iron on the sign, with your hand holding the iron upright.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him until you reach the mouth with it: or repeat with it another time if you did not reach the mouth with it the first time up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it and cause harm or death or great evil through it on the sick person.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you cannot find a cautery, your operation is not complete.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	And it is necessary for the cautery to be delicate for children, according to their size.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care with other ointments until it heals.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let him be weak lying on his back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary to give him food of a length of time for his healing, which soothes his belly: so that the intestine does not exit during defecation and excretion.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then give him a well-made bandage, and hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And reduce his labor, and food and drink intake, and violent voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, thus heals completely with healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will tell the healing of ruptures with incision in his chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however the rupture occurs in the remaining belly, and they are beginning, and you want not to add, then cauterize his rupture with a round cautery according to its quantity: and let that which is burned from then be like the third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for him, with what we said: and he should not be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And now some have said: to cauterize the rupture with a triangular cautery, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is signed with encaustic, and a line is placed which is through the width in the upper side of the rupture, and another line to the lower.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the cautery closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	In the case of pain due to a wound or blow, this is the method of cauterization.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens to certain members due to a wound or blow, and the pain persists for a long time and does not improve with medication, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And the cautery should be of a size and strength appropriate to the member, its weakness, its power, its twisting, and the pain caused by it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If therefore it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not: then repeat the cauterization on it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the habit of these pains, they often change from one member to another that is close to it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Therefore it is necessary to follow them with a cautery until the sick member is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	In the case of leprosy, this is the method of cauterization.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	Sometimes leprosy is healed by the greatest cauterization.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	Especially the kind of leprosy that is caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy, when you want to cauterize it, consider.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If therefore the leprosy is incurable, and you have treated it with what we said in the division, and it has not descended nor stood still, and you fear that corruption will spread over the whole of its complexion: then cauterize it on the head five times: one in the middle of the head, and the second below towards the front of the hair, and two on the two horns, and one behind on the nape of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And finally your hand with the cautery a little, until it imprints a small impression on the mouth, and the skin is loosened: so that the heavy breathing of the vapors is relieved, and cauterize also on the spleen, according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	If the leprosy has already spread over the sick person and is manifestly visible, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries, which we mentioned at the beginning, and with a cauterizer on the tip of the nose, and with two cauterizers on the two maxillae, and with two cauterizers on the spines of the neck, and six on the spines of the back, and one large one on the buttocks and one above it, in the middle of the buttocks: and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of his chest: and cauterize him over every joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize over every heel of his feet, and the wrists of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And beware of the nerves that are on the back of the last heel, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And sometimes cauterize with a cauterizer on the beak of the tongue, and another on the mouth, and another on the esophagus.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And know that the more you add a cauterizer, the greater the relief and the better it helps.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And know that the sick person does not feel pain from the cauterizer, as healthy people do: because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizers be of a size and shape according to the limbs and joints: as was previously specified from the types of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the cauterizer with flour of herb mixed with honey, and the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in a stupor.
Caput L.	Chapter 1.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	When a certain limb is numb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, but does not heal, then burn that numb limb with cauteries, according to the size or extent of the limb.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And sometimes cauterize it for a certain numbness that occurs in the hand, and foot, on the spine at the exit of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness will be removed.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not presume over it, unless he is wise in the anatomy of limbs, and the exit of nerves that move the body.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	On the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Caput LI.	Chapter 61.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albaras is not covered with anything from the skills of medicine: then cauterize it slightly on that deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with flour of herb, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of dove, and blood of goose: each of these is one part: mix all these, and they will be poured on cloth, and adhere to the place, until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	On the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	Chapter 62.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	When cancer is beginning, and you want to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it turns.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But wise men say, that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	To me, however, it does not appear that way: for I fear lest it should fester: and I have seen this thing often enough.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	It is indeed better, to cauterize around it with a circle, as we said: or with many cautery-irons.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the method of cauterizing in Albucasis.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has Albucasis, and the maturation is delayed, either because of excessive bleeding which he causes, or because of old age, when he is an infirm old man with little blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Albucasis, then cauterize around it with many small cautery-irons by pricking.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let it go.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you wish to make a perforation in it with a cautery, then use a cautery-iron of this form.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of Albucasis, until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery-iron be weak from that which follows, to ease the course of the pure.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the method of cauterizing in a corroding wound.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LXXXIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A corroding wound is not other than a corruption in a moving member, and it corrodes it: just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If therefore you see a corroding wound in a place which can bear a cautery-iron with fire, then use many cautery-irons, small and large, according to what is suitable for that place where the corroding wound is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all parts until the whole root of the corruption is removed, and nothing remains of it entirely.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let him rest for three days, and apply powdered sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scabs are removed and all corruption is eliminated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then care for him with flesh-generating ointments.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If therefore you see that after three days flesh is growing in a healthy manner, free from corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And apply a sharp medicine when necessary for corrosion.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises in the place of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, the cauterization with fire is a faster method of healing: and indeed I have already spoken of its division with sharp medicine; therefore take it there when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	Of the method of cauterization in Claus and Verucis.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	Frequently it happens in the lower parts of the feet that this ailment occurs: and it is a rough, running sore that injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And indeed the cauterization in them is according to two methods: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However, when with fire, it is made like a hollow feather of a pen: which is made from iron, according to the amount that it contains the claw on all sides: and it is thin at the edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place it burning on the claw.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then turn your hand with the cauterization around the claw, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the claw: and let him rest for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply plasters of your choice with sulfur, crushed with salt: and let the plaster be applied to him at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	He will be uprooted from his roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with a generative flesh ointment until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted and often occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply heat to them with hot water: and take a cannula from the air, or iron, or from the feather of a turkey dove: and place it on the hole, or althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw in the cannula from hot water a small amount: hold your hand and turn it with your hand compression for a while, so that the edge of the cannula is pressed into the root of the nail, and the hot water finds a way to the depth, to the root of the nail: and wait for the weak one for an hour on the sting of hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let him go, for the nail is uprooted with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do with them one after another, until you come over all who are from them on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then care for them after they are uprooted with that which generates flesh from ointments.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	¶ On the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter 66.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone with tremor from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or from something else: then it is necessary to cauterize him with four or five cauteries on the spines of the back, and between every spine a cauterization, and in his chest a cauterization, and on his stomach a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the tremor is quiet with the oil cauterization, and hastens the health of the cold sickness.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	¶ On the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	Sometimes foul blisters, that is, boils, are expelled from the body, which arise from corrupted coarse matters.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, when they appear, they should be cauterized over the entire head of the blister with a thin cautery and with myrtle wood, whose end is burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of long-leaved achillea.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lens-shaped cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And sometimes they are cauterized in this manner at the beginning of their expulsion: and they do not increase: and the excess is broken, which causes them, and they are cured from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it must be done after evacuation with venesection.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	Of the manner of cauterizing in the flow of blood from the artery in a wound.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	Many times it happens that the flow of blood from an artery which has been cut at a wound, which happens externally, or at the incision of an abscess, or a cauterizing iron on the member, and similar things to them: and it is difficult to remove it.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When therefore it happens to someone that thing, then hasten with your hand to the opening of the artery, and place on top of it your finger: and press it much, until the blood is blocked under your finger, and nothing comes out from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place on the small cautery of wax and many more: and blow on them until they are burned greatly.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or a few, or many, according to the wound and the place in which the artery is broken, and place the cautery on the vein, after which you remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is cut.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If the thorn is expelled from the wound and the finger is cut off from the opening of the artery, and the heated iron is extinguished, then take another heated iron quickly, from the irons that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Therefore do not cease to do this with one after another, until the blood stops flowing.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And beware, lest you burn the nerves which are there, and another evil may occur on the weak part.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is impossible to remove it: especially when the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with an iron, as we said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with the extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, the ends of it are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or it is tied with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or medicines of proper property are placed on it, which is to cut off the blood and tie with a decent compression.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	But whoever administers the cutting of it with a ligature and tying with a cloth, or the position of things that burn and similar, does not give it to him completely, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if something happens to him of that, and he is not present with a physician or medicine: then he begins with the position of the finger index over the opening of the vein itself, as we have said, and the compression of it greatly, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger is not removed, above it with cold water of great cold always, until the blood freezes, and thickens, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And meanwhile he considers in it what is needed from the iron, or from the medicine.

Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars II.	Book of Surgery by Albucasis, Part Two.
¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incisions, Punctures, and Bloodletting in Wounds and Similar Cases.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have already mentioned in Chapter One that all pain which is suitable for the use of a cauterizing fire and burning medicine, along with its causes, reasons, instruments, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I placed chapters from head to foot there.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I proceed in this chapter the same way: so that it may alleviate those seeking the sought.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, it is necessary for you to learn, son, what is in this chapter from the fear of that which is in Chapter One about cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that reason, it is necessary to have greater caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, often falls evacuation with blood, with which stands life at the opening of the vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of exit, or cure of wound, or extraction of arrow, or incision on stone, and from all these, it is associated with trembling, and fear, and falls in many of them death.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I advise you not to fall into that in which is hesitation, for sometimes such people come to you in this art with such ways of men and their weaknesses.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is he who is angry with his pain, and is light in him towards death: because of the vehemence of it which he found from his weakness and length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And with pain is from fear which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from them is he who gives his song, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his pain is destructive.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it is not necessary to consent to him who comes to you from among them whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And your caution should be more urgent than your greed and your ravenousness.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume upon anything from him unless after a certain certain knowledge which verifies with you that succession is praiseworthy to which he arrives.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use them in the treatment of all your sick, for diagnosis and indication of what is fittingly for their health.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him is to you a helper for the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God breathe into you, O son, his understanding, and not take from you direction and inspiration: for that is in his hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And indeed I have arranged this Chapter by distinguishing it into chapters, according to what preceded in the chapter of Cauterization, from the scalp to the feet: so that it may be alleviated to you what you seek from him and what you need.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ On the treatment of water that gathers in the heads of children.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this infirmity often occurs to children at birth: or when the midwife tightly binds the head of the child without gentleness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And also when it happens for an unknown cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And indeed I have not seen this ailment in other than children: and to all of whom I have seen from them hasten death: therefore it seemed to me to leave the operation in it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And indeed I have seen from them a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was glorified every day, until he could not sit on himself, because of the greatness of his own head: and the moisture increased, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	This moisture either accumulates between the skin and bone, or beneath the bone above the sinew.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And if the operation is performed on moisture between the skin and bone, and it is a small abscess, then it is necessary to make a cut in the middle of the head, one in width, and the length of the cut should be like two nodes, until the moisture is drained.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	This is the shape of the incision.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If therefore the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two cuts, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the sign of it is, that you see the edges of the head open from all parts: and water is pressed when you press it with your hand to the insides, and it does not hide itself from you, then it is necessary to make three cuts in the middle of the head, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision, extract all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then bind the cuts with cloths and cotton.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then rub it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the ligament, and care for the wound with compresses, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not dismiss binding the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick person with all food dry and little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another manner of incision is, that you consider where the size of the abscess appears, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For when it is often in the back, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore ascend with the incision where the abscess appears to you and is full of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, lest you cut the artery, and blood flow occurs, and the sick person dies from that flow with the discharge of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	On the incision of arteries which are after the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a person has a catarrh to the eyes, or to the chest, and that is not cured by medical treatment: then the last cure for that person is the incision of those two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the sick person bend his head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person ties his neck with any of his cloths.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the vein pulses.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the locations of both are locations which are after the ears depressed: and it is rarely hidden, unless in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with a hot iron on both: and incise both with a narrow knife on each side, the incision going to the bone: and let that be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert a narrow knife under the artery, and incise it to the upper part with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be like two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is incised, blood escapes with a pulsating flow, which jumps to the inside frequently.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	But if the artery does not appear to the senses, then it is necessary that you measure from the ear the distance of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with a hot iron, and incise until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which is to be emitted from the blood is six unciae, and perhaps you may emit more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	According to the appearance of the quantity that seems to you due to the weakness of the patient and the filling of his artery, do that.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains at the bone from the siphon anything, then cut that, so that it does not happen that a hot abscess occurs: then bind the wound with lint from a cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	¶ About the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When it happens to a man that he has ancient hemicrania, or sharp catarrh because of acrid humors, and heat in the temples, or old bile, strong, and similar to those: and he is treated with the methods of cure of medicine, and does not bear it: then we have experienced these ailments extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have narrated.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of operation in their extraction is, that the sick one shaves the hairs that are in the temples, and directs himself to the artery that appears in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	For indeed it is shown to you from his pulse, and rarely is hidden unless in a few men, or because of the vehemence of cold.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	But if it is hidden from you, then the sick one binds his head with any of his cloths: then he rubs the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or steam the place with hot water, until it appears to you by a clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take the little lancet, which I formed a little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin with ease, until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then thrust in it a hook, and extract it towards the upper parts, until you have extracted it from the skin, and make it go away from the garments that are under it from every part.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If however the artery is thin: then cover it with the tip of the needle.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to the length at which their tips contract and do not cause blood flow.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it does not cut and if it is not cut off, the blood will not rise completely.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then evacuate from the blood six ounces, up to three.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If however the artery is large: then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk or of hair, as not to rush to its putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound and that blood flow does not occur.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut the superfluity which is between the two knots.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cauterizer up to the bone, with a scalpel, until their tips cut and it stands in the place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better work, unless if he is weak and has a fever or of hot constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	Because the cauterizer is of those that help to end moistures.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is a better remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, the place should be filled with old cautery: and they should be placed on it well-made pads.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution, it should be treated with dry medicines that make flesh grow and with liniments until it is healed.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If however in the meantime while you are operating blood flow occurs from the artery, then rush to cut it with a cauterizer or to fill the place with zeolite: and hold your hand, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of those is present with you, then place it on the place of your finger until the blood congeals.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And rub the place with strong cold water until the sharpness subsides and it contracts as it should.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And because it is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it has a cauterizing knife with this cauterizer having two blades: let the sharpness of the two blades be like alum.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	Since if they are as sharp as two knives, each freezes quickly: and they do not cut the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	But since there is a little thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut quickly: therefore it is better for every work, and lighter and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space between the two blades that is as thick as the thickness of your finger, after you have marked two places with the cauterizer: and put both hot ones, until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that it is lengthened between its ends.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not harden completely with this cauterizer.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauterizer.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	¶ On the care of the course of sharp and frequent tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are frequent and their course is from the eyes which are above the skull externally: and nothing of medicine is applied to them with other medicines, and you see the face of the sick already red, and feels in his forehead a walk, as if it were the walking of ants: and his eyes are weakened, humid, so that already the hair on them has been worn away by corrosion: and his eyelids are heated from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients needed in their cure of these this operation, and called it a cure with the Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, that you command the sick one to shave the hairs that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then, you should make three evenly spaced incisions across the forehead according to its length: and let the length of the incision be about two fingers, and one incision should be evenly spaced with the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length slightly above the shoulder blades, and the third on the other side: and beware of the incision of the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand away from the continuity of the two jaws, and let the entire length of the incision be about three fingers joined together: and let there be a prepared piece of sponge or dry cloth with which to absorb the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then, insert a two-bladed sharp instrument, of which the following is its shape.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision that is on the temple side, up to the second incision: and scrape off with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the sphincter, which is above the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do the same from the middle incision up to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this instrument and insert another instrument, called a sharp-edged knife, from one side gently, not sharply from the other side.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place its sharp side towards the flesh and skin, and its gentle side towards the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut off with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to what appears of the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do the same in the middle incision up to another incision.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	After an equal amount of blood has flowed out, press the areas where the clotted blood is located.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place linen soaked in old cooked linseed in every crack, and place on top of them damp cloths soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And be sure that the abscess does not become hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the bandage, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with basilicon ointment, and with other remedies used to treat wounds: until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ On the care of sharp tears and catarrh from the interior of the head to the eyes.
Caput V.	Chapter 5.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When sharp catarrh occurs to someone frequently, sharply, and constantly: and you see his eyes weakened, small, and already weakened in appearance: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the depth of the head, wounding, and following sneezing: then take from these accidents that those materials, and catarrh do not come, except from many vices.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And a better cure for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, that you command the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut one incision in the middle of his forehead, or another a little wider in width, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple: and let the incision be up to the bone: and keep your hand away from the moving jaws at chewing: until when the bone is exposed: and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between two lips of the incision with old cooked linseed, or with linen cloths.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then tie it above with swabs: and drink swabs with wine and oil, so that no heat abscess may occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you untie it, and see that the heat abscess is already diminishing: then it is necessary to knead the mouth, until flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with an evaporating regimen that causes flesh to grow: as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch: and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	¶ On the care of that which falls into the Ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or a stone like it, such as iron and flint: or it is from a plant, such as peas and beans: or it is a fluid, such as water, and vinegar, and the like: or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore a stone, or kind of stone from those which do not add and grow in the ear, falls into the ear, expose the Ear alone: if therefore you see the stone, then pour something from broken oil, or sawdust, into the Ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer its extraction, and make him sneeze with the condensed [substance], and open the nose with an onion at the approach of sneezing, after you have placed in the vicinity of the ear fragments of cloth, or wool, and extend the ear to the superior [part].
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Often indeed it goes out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If however it does not go out, then administer its extraction with Gesti, that is, finely ground pizzarol: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If he goes out with his clothes on, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of his tooth with a blunt-ended, fine, thin hook of few doublings.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If he does not come out through that, then make a canula of air, and insert the end of the canula into the ear hole a lot, and put a softened piece of clay with oil around the canula so that there is no wind except for the canula: then extract it with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Very often he comes out with what we have mentioned.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if he does not come out this way: then take from helkalimbat, or from visco, that is, prepared glue with which birds are caught, a small amount: and put it on the end of the radius after you have wrapped it in a cloth properly placed: then insert it into the ear hole when you have dried the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If he does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then hurry to break it before an abscess of hot pus, or spasm, occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the method of incision is, that you use a lancet on the weak one in the first place in the cephalic: and extract it from his blood according to the measure of its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit between your hands, and turn his ear to the superior parts, and make a small incision in the root of the ear at the fatty part of him in the depressed place: and let the incision be in the shape of a crescent moon until you reach the stone: then take it with that which is possible from your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then sew his incision from your hour with speed, and care for it until he is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If what falling into the ear is from one of the grains that grow and swell: then administer the extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If it still does not obey you at the end, then take a thin, delicate spatula in this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And administer with it the incision of that kind from the grains that fall into your ear, and do not do it when you think that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you place many pieces of it: then extract them with hooks, or with a thin instrument, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is relieved.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But in the water that enters your ear, it is necessary to use a weak sneezing with the disinfected first: and now it has filled its own ear with a little old cooked one: and it is lying on that ear, in which there is water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	Therefore if it comes out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of your finger, thin, gentle, and heat them with fire for a while, and the weak one inserts one of them into the hole of its ear: and he salts one of his feet from that part, and strikes with another stone on the stone that is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore do not stop doing it with the stone and the stone until all the water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And now the water comes out so that you take one from the parpyro, or from the junco, and insert one of its ends into your ear: and light the other end with fire, until it is burned a lot of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then repeat the junco again, and do it many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a cannula as was prescribed in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	But in the extraction of the animal that enters it, if it is small of body, like a flea, and similar to it, care for it as I said in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	However, if it is a large body part that is visible to the senses: then perform its extraction with forceps and hooks, and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	However, in the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it with what we mentioned in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your cure does not combine: then you must look at the ear in the sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	Therefore, if something appears there from the worms, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	But if nothing appears there, then take a cannula, whose form is this: narrow below, wide above: and insert its fine end into the ear according to the amount that an infirm person can bear: then suck with it strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this many times, until all the worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	But if they do not obey you to exit, then wrap the cannula with ash, as I said in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	But if they do not come out with that which we said: then perform distillations which the ancients have been experienced in in the piercing of worms: and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your effusion be what you pour out oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	Just as you see make it from silver, or from brass, below narrow, in which there is a small hole, wide above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	Therefore let the pushing that is in the hollow of the cannula be made from brass properly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you wish, take a ray, and wrap it in the end of it with a proper wrapping: then project oil, or succum, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula: and it is in the ear: then insert the ray with cotton above, and press it gently by your hand until the oil is pushed into the hollow of the ear, and he feels it inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be already warmed with a little fire: and beware that what is distilled into it is not very cold: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	¶ On the care of the accidental wounding of Gold (possibly a reference to gold fillings or dental work).
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes, certain infants emerge from their mother's wombs unharmed, not having been pierced.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some men that the wounding of the ear occurs in the opening of the ear due to an injury or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this wounding of the ear sometimes occurs in the deep opening of the ear, which vision does not reach: and sometimes it happens to the outer part of the opening, and vision reaches it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Therefore, that which happens in the deep part of the ear, and which does not include the scope of vision, is often difficult to heal in many positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which vision reaches, it is necessary to place the ear of the sick person in the sun, and look at it: then if you see the wounding appearing, open it with a thin, subtle spatula, whose form is as follows: its end is small, and has a slight width; and the rest of the spatula is two-sided, smooth: so that it does not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If therefore the wounding is born from flesh in the opening of the ear: then hold it with a thin tweezer, and cut it with great force until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the wounding is in the deep part of the ear: then take a thin, smooth, warm needle, and heat it with a small fire: then put it into the opening of the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If therefore you feel the wounding with that which the sick person has, when he has great difficulty hearing, try to open it with ease: and beware, lest you wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place in the ear, linen according to the quantity of the foramen's width, which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment. Make it for several days until you are secure about the consolidation of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take linen and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle powdered zeig on it, and use it thus.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see that the ear is already abscessing, then it is necessary to remove the linen and let it with another piece of linen, which you have soaked in rose oil, until the abscess sits warm: then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	But if bleeding occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear: and use the remaining cure, which stops the aforementioned blood flow in the treatment of distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	¶ On the care of Althaea's eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Althaea's which occur in the eyelids of the eye, sometimes are moist, and sometimes are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore you must hold them with tweezers: or with an unguent, and cut them with a lancet from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place powdered zeig on the spots.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	But if blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens cauterizer.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For often they return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	¶ On the care of Granatum's eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	It frequently happens that something similar to a storm (Grando) occurs in the eyelids due to its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called Grando. It is an accumulation of thick moisture above the upper eyelid and below the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore, the operation in this case is to consider whether it is Grando that is proceeding from what appears from the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its nature is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore, find a cut above it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape it from all parts with ease until it becomes smooth.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a probe and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	But if the cut of it is not prepared for you unless after you penetrate the eyelid with an incision a little, then it harms the weak one in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the cut is large, then gather it with a suture and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, you will not encounter harm from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For the ointment restores it and fleshens it.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if Grando is declining towards the inner parts of the ear towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid and suspend the Grando with a probe: but you will need an incision and press it from all parts.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	But if the eyelid is lengthened by an incision, it does not harm it in some way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the cut of Grando with salt water: and care for the place with it that fleshens until the weak one heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ On the care of Axirnath of the eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is a fatty substance that forms in the eyelids of the upper eyelid: and it particularly affects children: and it makes their eyes heavy, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because their tears rush to them, and because of this you see them lying on their faces all the time, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are wet under the swollen eyebrows, which has already been covered by inflation: and the protrusion of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press it with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation for this is that the sick person puts his head on your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare linseed in it, and make a circle from it of the size that contains Axirnath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place him on it, and press with your fingers from all sides, so that Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of that moisture with a sharp lancet making incisions of width, and let there be no incision larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it is necessary to make an incision in the whole skin, until you reach Axirnath, for in many arrangements Axirnath proceeds from the incision according to the shape of a white fat slice.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then extract it with the cloth that you have placed between your fingers to the outside: and you turn your hand to the right and left, until it is spread: and beware, do not add to the incision, so that it does not reach with the lancet to the eye, and you hurt him.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the incision, you will add it with some ease into the incision until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then extract it, as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the spot, and bind it with bandages.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are some who apply salt to it, and place it in the hollow of the incision, so that what remains from that moisture may melt.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if an abscess occurs in that place, then care for it with soothing plasters, until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	CONCERNING THE WAYS OF ATAXMIR'S EYES, THAT IS, WHEN THE EYEBEAM SOFTENS THE EYES, WHEREBY IT BECOMES SUCH THAT IT TEARS AS IT SHOULD NOT.
Caput XI.	CHAPTER 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	WHEN ADDITIONAL HAIR IS BORN IN THE EYEBEAMS BEYOND ITS NATURAL COURSE UNDER THE HAIR, AND IT AGES: THEN IT HARMS THE EYE, AND CAUSES THE ONSET OF AILMENTS, SUCH AS FREQUENT TEARS, AND SOFTENING OF THE EYEBEAMS, AND WHITE OF THE EYE, UNTIL THAT BECOMES THE CAUSE OF DESTRUCTION OF THE EYE.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	AND ATAXMIR'S EYES ARE CURED ACCORDING TO FOUR WAYS.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	OR BY CAUTERIZATION WITH FIRE.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	OR WITH ACUTE MEDICINE, AS PREVIOUSLY STATED IN THE CHAPTER ON CAUTERIZATION.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	OR ATAXMIR'S EYES ARE CURED BY INCISION AND SUTURING.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	OR BY CANNULAS, AS I WILL SAY.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	IT IS NECESSARY TO PLACE THE HEAD OF THE INFIRM ON YOUR BOSOM.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert the needle into it, where the thread is from the lower part of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate with the thread from above, and let it be near the hairs, that is, near the margin of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a forceps.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with a probe entering from the larger lacrimal canal up to the smaller one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then remove the thread, and place a small amount of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: then mark on the eyelid with a cauterizer, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it must be made like the shape according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: because it is already varied among men.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For there are those who need that a large amount of it should enter from the eyelid according to the quantity which is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with a probe find above two lines which you marked, and begin from the larger lacrimal canal up to the smaller one, and let there be a slit near the natural hairs, like the size of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert a hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape it all off.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather it with a suture two lips, with a needle and fine wool thread: and wipe off the blood, and make what is superfluous from the threads over two eyebrows, with some things that cover, if you want to do that: and if not, do not care.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the suture and thread for three days, or four; afterwards care for that.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let go of the wound without suture, and care for it along with that which dries and constricts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid is raised at the sign of the wound and its union: but a better one is to come.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This method of healing, the ancients taught Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	However, there is anxiety over the weak one, and it is from good operation, and there is not in it fear.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is, that the signs above the eyelid are shaped like a figure, which is like the figure of myrtle leaves, as we have told.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then raise the eyelid with three separate or joined needles, according to this following form, then cut off what exceeds with small scissors, according to this form, with equality of incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if it is not possible for you to hold the needle, and it is not equal: then take a needle in which is thread, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the lacrimal larger, and thread near the lacrimal smaller: and gather the threads with equality between your fingers.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then raise your hand evenly: and raise the skin over which is marked with the sign, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather two lips of the wound with suture: and care for it, until it is healed.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if indeed abscess happens at your incision, or your wound: dry up that abscess with charcoal, and with these similar, from ointments suppressing.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens to the eyelid also, that its hairs are turned.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore, you should use what we mentioned in the incision in that [place], but a stitch on both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	On the care of Ataxmir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	AND IT IS, that you turn the eyelid and split the wound which is inside, as I have said.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	THEN YOU SHOULD MAKE TWO CANES, OR TWO THIN WOODEN STICKS: THE LENGTH OF WHICH SHOULD BE ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE EYELID, AND THE WIDTH LESS THAN THE WIDTH OF A FINGER: AND YOU ALREADY INCISED IN THE EXTREMITIES OF BOTH FROM BOTH SIDES WHERE YOU HOLD THE THREADS.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	THEN YOU SHOULD AGGREGATE BOTH WITH THINNESS ON TOP OF WHAT OVERFLOWS FROM THE EYELID, AND TIE THE TWO CANES FROM BOTH SIDES WITH A STRONG KNOT, AND LET IT GO FOR SEVERAL DAYS.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	BECAUSE THE SKIN IS TIGHT, IT WILL DIE, DISCOLOR, AND ROT, UNTIL IT FALLS OFF BY ITSELF.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	IF HOWEVER IT DELAYS, THEN CUT IT WITH FORCEPS.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	THEN CARE FOR IT, UNTIL IT HEALS.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	WHEN HOWEVER IT CONSOLIDATES, LIFT THE EYELID: AND DO NOT PICK AT THE HAIR.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	AND THIS IS THE SHAPE OF TWO CANES, WHICH YOU SHOULD MAKE ACCORDING TO THIS FIGURE, AND IN QUANTITY IN LENGTH AND WIDTH.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	ON LIFTING HAIR THAT PRICK THE EYE WITH A NEEDLE.
Caput XII.	CHAPTER 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	THE OPERATION IN THAT IS, THAT YOU TAKE A FINE NEEDLE, AND INSERT IT INTO THE HAIR FROM FINE SILK THREAD, GENTLY.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	THEN YOU AGGREGATE ITS EXTREMITIES, AND TIE BOTH KNOTS WITH A THIN KNOT VERY WELL: AND THE LENGTH OF THE THREAD SHOULD BE ONE FINGER.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose in Alinxotati a thin thread under it in short, and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then place the weak person's head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the operation can be seen: for it is a delicate or minor operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the needle with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly, until you remove it from above the natural eyelash.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the needle up to above Alinxotati: and insert the needle into Alinxotati if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it until the needle exits with Alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural eyelash.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If however Alinxotati is drawn and the needle does not exit with it: draw Alinxotati to the lower parts, with the thread that you composed in it, until Alinxotati exits from the upper opening, and see it with the vision of the eye: for then draw Alinxotati and the thread, and remove both, and close the eye: and let him be closed for two days or three, until the needle sticks in its place, and flesh grows over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If however the needle is short, then associate with it a long needle from the natural needles, and raise it with it: or let him be, until it lengthens after a time, and then raise it.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	¶ On the care of Alinxotati that happens in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this Alinxotati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this Alinxotati is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	An accidental wound is caused by the consolidation of a wound, or a cut, or a cauterization, and similar things to these.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the method of operation in it is, that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and that you put in it what is between them linen from flax, and bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And you should not use in the treatment of it things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, Alexatrati returns worse than it was: rather use in it those things that soften, such as fenugreek: and rub with water in which althea has been cooked, seed of flax: and unguent dyaquilon, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it linen, and care for it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And your treasure of treatment is, that you try every ingenuity, that it not consolidate, according to the form that was first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have said, is not but some correction of Alexatrati, that it does not return the form of the place according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	¶ On the care of Alexatrati which is made in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alexatrati which is below, is what is truly called Alexatrati.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural, and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And accidental is caused by a wound, or a cut, or a cauterization, and those similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And the method of operation in it is, that you take an acum, in which there is a thread doubled, and you moisten it with flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh towards the upper part with a needle, and cut it with a broad, flat instrument.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the figure of the eyelid returns as it should, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the ray, and place it in the fissure, and turn it with it the eyelid: and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the ends of the two fissures be from two angles of the incision, until they meet and make an angle: until when they gather together, this figure is made, and it is the Greek letter.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that flesh by the amount, which is the sharp side of its lower width, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: sew it with a woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we said about healing ointments and lotions, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if Alexander's disease occurs from the fissure and the suture, or with a cauterizer: then it is necessary to make the fissure flat under the eyelashes, even as it preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between two lips with a lotion, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the final word on the care of Alexander when it is above or below, is that the operation should be carried out in it, according to how it is prepared from the form of Alexander.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	For indeed it is of many diverse forms: and the skilled craftsman prepares his skill with whatever way is possible to him, until he makes the figure return to its natural form, or near to it, and himself the sick person, according to what fits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Translation: Concerning the adherence of the eyelid to the eye, whether it be united with the conjunctiva or the cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	Sometimes this adherence occurs to many people in such a way that the upper eyelid becomes united with the white of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore, you should insert the tip of the ray under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a spoon: then incise the adherence with a thin, blunt-edged knife, which is not sharp in its incision, but rather dull: so that the weak person does not suffer during the operation, and the knife is removed without damaging the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you are scraping off the adherence with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form and the adherence is completely healed.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then pour salt water into the eye with clear water to clean it: or sprinkle it with water from a sponge made of zinc dissolved in water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen cloth: and place on the eye a woolen cloth soaked in limewater: and use the sponge after three days, and with firm bandages, until it is healed.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Concerning the incision of the nail and the prominence of flesh in the eyes.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You should know that the nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Either it is nervous: and it is similar to a sponge hard and thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to the frozen moisture of a white substance: which when it touches the iron, or you try to take it with a knife, it is cut off and does not stick to the knife.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both species do not begin, except from a larger lacrimal, until it gradually goes, until it covers the sight, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation in its incision is: that he places his weak head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then gather the horn with a few notches of the scalpel, and extend it to the upper parts.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert a pin from horsehair, or goose, or chicken feathers: and let it be a strong thread, and double the tip of the needle slightly, and fix it in the middle of the horn: and pierce it with the needle, and tie the horn with the thread, and extend it to the upper parts: and scrape the side of the horn that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the pin until the end of its tail.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut the remaining part at the root of the lacrimal with a thin saw, or with small forceps: and let go the natural flesh of the lacrimal, so that it does not happen from its incision that the course of tears is constant.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And sometimes the horn is extended with a single notch of the scalpel: or with a thread, as we said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with a thin saw, which has this form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, lest the saw touch the horn's skin, and it happens to it a breakage, and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, put something salty into the eye, or some powder made from sieves and zinc, and let it go until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for him with what is necessary, until he is healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the hoof is not nervous and you cannot insert an awl into it or attach a needle to it, then this type of hoof is often treated with medicines and heals as described in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the sick animal, and take a thin, weak, blunt awl according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And shave the hoof from above with a razor with delicacy.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is becoming thin and broken, and you press a razor into it, then pour from your hourglass into the eye made from siif, or red siif, or finely ground salt: and oil the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat the operation on it until all of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless the opposite is true for you in the eye, an abscess of heat: then leave it and treat the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on it with a razor until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	However, the prominence of the eyelid, if it causes harm in the eye with great damage, is suspended with a needle, and cut from that part: and do not complete the incision, so that the course of tears does not occur.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then pour in the eyelid siif red, or made from siif, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ On the incision of Algardhenic, and flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Flesh sometimes arises in certain human eyes, composed or placed red, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or stretches over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids to the outside: and it resembles a rose of balm.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	The operation on her is also that she places her sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open her eyes and gather all that flesh together with the suitable hooks to that: and hold it with one forceps, or with a pair of tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh in the first place, until it ends all of hers with the incisor.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so that you do not wound it during the operation: and your incision should be with a small knife, which we have mentioned in the incision of the hoof: or with small forceps, with which she is picked up, according to the shape of her after this head.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When therefore your incision is completed, and all the guard-flesh has been removed, then fill her eye with crushed salt: or sprinkle in it red powder, and similar things to her from corrosive medicines: and place on the eye of the deformed one cotton with egg white: so that it is secured from pus hot.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If however there remains any of the guard-flesh, and hot blood rules you, and you fear pus hot: then let go the eye, and care for him with that which sedates the pus.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over him with the operation, until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly do with the flesh added which happens in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However it is necessary that the treatment of all eyes of the weak person from the natural way, or from the accidental way, operating with iron: and you do not introduce your hand in any of these operations, until you see, that that member is tolerating that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ On the collection of Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Beneath the eyelids are red veins that cover the eye and prevent their own operation, and weaken the eye over time.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to first consider whether the eye in which there is a Sebel is strong and has no other illness besides a Sebel, then gather the Sebel from that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is your command to prescribe to the weak one, that he put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend those veins with a needle one or two according to your wisdom: and the needle should be thin for suture, in this form, or there should be two needles gradually in one body, in this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then gather those veins with fine forceps with delicacy, and wipe off the blood hour by hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye, and dissolve: and beware of not injuring the eye with the tips of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day in front of the sun, and you be firm in your operation greatly: so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have filled, then pour in the eye green or red water: so that its sharpness corrodes what remains from a Sebel.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If however it is not possible for you to gather all of it in that hour, then apply ointments to the eye with what soothes the eye pain: and leave him for several days until the pain settles: and secure it from suppuration hot: then repeat on it according to the same method, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	Chapter on the reduction of Arissati to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The physicians call the fistula of Arris, which they treat with a cautery or with a sharp-burning medicine, according to what precedes its description.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it is not cured, then there is no skill in it: unless you find above the abscess at its birthplace and remove all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the opening is cleaned.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When therefore the opening is cleaned and you see in it corruption or discoloration, then scrape it with an instrument whose shape is like this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the Asper of the head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron and its head be round like an azir, which is dotted with the dotting of a file or the dotting of an aliskilferi, fine dotting, and place it on the spot of the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it between your fingers and you press your hand on it a little, until you know that that corruption is now scraped off, and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the spot with dry-healing styptics.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If therefore the spot is consolidated and flesh grows in it, and the course of pus is cut off, and it remains for forty days without being renewed or becoming an abscess or any accident happening to it, then you will know that it has been cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no skill in it: unless you reduce the fistula to the opening of the nose, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is, that you scrape away from the bone second with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the opening is scraped, then take a drill according to this shape, its end be iron, triangular: and the wood of it is a flattened pyramid until the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place it on the eye itself: and let it be near the lacrimal point: and keep your hand away from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then turn your hand with the trephine until it penetrates the eye, and let him feel the weak one: by which he found the wind coming out of it, when he holds his hand on his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with astringent ointments, as I taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When therefore the flesh is born and the place is hardened: then the matter that flowed to the outside returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter on the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	On the reduction of the protrusion of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye protrudes with all of it, and no harm occurs in the sight, nor diminution: then you should dissolve the weak one: then you should bleed him: afterwards you should place aerosols in the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place on the eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and olibanum, and sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then bind the eye above with a plaster with many cottons.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of cottons is: that you take soft cloths, many, and double each cloth over four: make many from them: then place them one on top of another, according to the quantity that the eye needs: then bind them above with a hard cloth with a strong binding.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the aerosols with suction without scarification.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the aerosols, and let the eye loose during the day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	But if the bandage again becomes soft, then you should bind it a lot: then remove the bandage after day and night, as we said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see the eye beginning to return to its original position under the eyelid, it is good; but if not, then repeat the application of the plaster, cotton, and bandage, and the eye drops, until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	On making an incision in the eyelid.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a tear occurs in the eyelid, it protrudes and extends outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and disfigures the face due to this, and you want to cut it: then the operation on it is as follows: and it is to insert a needle into the root of the eyelid from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then insert another needle into which there is a double thread from the lacrimal part, and make it penetrate: and release the first needle according to its arrangement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie it with the part of the eyelid in the circumference of the needle: and tie it tightly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the needle, and place a wet bandage on the eye on the sclera: and release it, until the thread falls with the eyelid.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, which strengthens it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And sometimes the eyelid is tied all around with a bandage from cloth, until the eye gains great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then puncture with a thin needle, which reaches deep into the eye, and drain the moisture from the sclera, and the eye descends, and enter immediately: then tie it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	On the treatment of almonds.
Caput XXII.	Chapter 22.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease which is called almonds, is not, unless it is pus, which collects in the eye, similar to water descending, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	The method of operation in this case is that you should make the infirm person sit on a prepared seat or a straight one.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head of the person in your hands from both sides and move it until you see health reach the lower parts of your eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it should be shaped and not go down, and the light should be completed: and the infirm person should see things as he used to: and if it does not go down lower, you will know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the preparation of the descent of health does not go with what we said, then make the infirm person sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a fine lancet and prick with it above the corneal membrane slightly at the continuity of the connected cornea in the crown until the pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it comes out, then pour hot water into the eye in which you mixed honey: or water in which you already boiled fenugreek and honey: then it should be treated with the rest of the cure until he is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	¶ On the care of water that goes into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	Now we have mentioned the appearance of water in division, and what is appropriate for piercing with speech declaring and explaining, then take that same one according to health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then therefore you should make the infirm person sit between your hands squarely, facing the light, near the sun: and tie the healthy eye, and tighten it very much: then with your right hand the eyelid of the eye in which is the water, if the eye in which is the water is the left eye: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand a lancet, if the eye is left: or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the needle near the edge of the cornea, close to the appearance of the radius' thickness in the whiteness of the lachrymal minor: then push the needle with force, and you turn it back with your hand until it penetrates into the sclera of the eye: and feel that the needle has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it should be that the length of the needle is a measure of its journey to the depth, a measure of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the darkness: and it is the edge of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the pupil itself, for the clarity of the cornea's tunic.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the needle until it reaches the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down evenly, one after the other.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If therefore water immediately flows down, then the sick person sees it above what opens his sight immediately, and the needle in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then rest a little.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If therefore water flows down, then lay it down secondly, except that the needle should exit.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When therefore it is stuck, and does not rise: then pull the needle out easily: and you turn back your hand gradually.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve some clear salt gem in water: and wash with it the eye from inside.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place outside the eye all the bandage, or the dyed wool with rose oil, and the sclera of the eye: and tie it with the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, place on him ground glass with the sclera of the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	If therefore the needle does not obey you for entering into the eye because of its hardness, since from men it is, whose eye is very hard: then it is necessary that you take a small spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the shape.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore, join the punctured part only, and do not insert your entire hand into the opening; rather, make a path to the subtle location of the almug tree.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almug wood, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the completion of your work, prepare a properly made bed for the sick person to sleep on his back in a dark house; and he should be prohibited from all movements, and coughing: and place his food which soothes his nature; and he should not move his head with his right hand, nor at all with his left.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to his condition up to the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and test his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the bandage up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it should not be done during the hour of healing, or immediately after the incision: rather, it should be done by others, because water rises quickly through a strong gaze.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if a boil becomes hot: then it is necessary to dissolve the eye before the seventh day: and correct it with what soothes the boil, until it is soothed: then complete his sight, and place on his face an oral remedy which regulates his sight for several days, while he is still in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should exit the house gradually, and return to his own quarters.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that in zaltea the student is not exempted from vision several times: then he dares to perform the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed, one of those who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that it happened in Alayrach that a man was pierced with a magdan, through which water is drawn.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Indeed, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this: nor have I read it in any of the ancient books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And those are the forms of species from the main, so that they stand above those who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of air properly: and their ends should be with this same subtlety triangular, and the sharp end.
Formae magda.	Forms of the main.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	OF THE CARE OF FLESH BORN IN THE NOSE.
Caput XXIIII.	HEAD XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	Sometimes flesh is born in the nose of different kinds, from which there is something that resembles a scorpion of many feet: and from it is cancerous flesh, stone-like, of a dark color: and from it is that which is flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In that therefore which is from those flesh that is soft, not deceitful, nor cancerous, you should do that the infirm person is placed opposite to you, and open his nose, and thrust a hook into those flesh: then pull them out to the outside, and cut what you have grasped from them with a sharp, thin spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If something remained from that of whose cutting is not possible: then shave it with one of the instrument's thin with ease, until there is nothing remaining from it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If however the blood rules you, or hot pus falls on you: then place it on him with what is necessary: or it is from malignant abscesses, then hurry to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off, and all the flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then throw into the nose after incision vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If the nose opens and moisture flows out from it up to the palate, then you will know that he is already healed.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you will know that there is flesh inside him born in the upper nasal bones, to which the instrument did not reach with the incision.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then therefore you must insert a string with some knots in it and many knots: and between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less: and the weak one should put one end of the string into his nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has done so similar to an azzer: and pull out his smell, until it reaches the bone, and comes out over his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And often indeed they do something similar to this to boys in school: and it is an easy thing for him who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then put two ends of the string, one end which comes out over the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then with a sharp knife cut the flesh with the knots that are on the string.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the string.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then remove the string: and put linen after washing away the blood into the Egyptian ointment which you imbibed: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has corroded all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put at the end of the matter into the nose a lead tube for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	But if he needs treatment which will dry out, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	To make the head purging, with which oil and other medicines distill into the nose, do this from silver, or air: that it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell: and its passage similarly.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	If you wish to make a closed cannula like a pipe.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And for making the concha of a purgative instrument, it should be full and emptied: with which is its handle at the end of it, with which you hold it when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish to extract from solid or fluid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the shape of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	Chapter on the care of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	The nose often develops at the end of the nose, and it grows and increases with age, until it becomes ugly in appearance.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And because of this, it is necessary to remove all of it at the beginning of its appearance.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place on the spot, or a cauterizer, or a burning medicine that remains in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If therefore the cutting of it is delayed until it grows large, then consider if it is hard, stony, of dark color, and few sensations: then do not touch it with iron: for it is an abscess that is cancerous.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	For often I have seen that one who cuts an abscess has suffered great harm from it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the abscess is gentle to the touch, not of dark color, and you see that it is possible to cut all of it, then evacuate the weak part, and cut it without fear, without pain: and care for the spot with what dries and contracts, until it is healed.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Chapter on sutures of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	Know that when dissolution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it does not hold together well in that operation, except in some men.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore, when something happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a fresh wound with its own blood. Then gather the edges of the wound with stitches, and then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the edges of continuity are already separated and each part has become healthy, then you must scrape off all the part from its apparent skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather two edges with a stitch and tie them, and sprinkle powder of dragon's blood on it, and powdered frankincense: and place above the powders a fragment of the plaster diafinicon, and some other fragment of consolidating plasters: and leave it tied for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it and change the medicine: and leave it until the stitches come off by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	However, the method of stitching is to gather the edges of continuity, or with a needle, as we told you about the stitch of the belly: or gather it with thread, as I have shown you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	¶ On the extraction of lip knots.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people indeed suffer from hard abscesses in the inner parts of their lips, similar to grains of herb: and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore you should turn the lip over, and cut across all the knot of it, and hang it up with a hook, and cut it from every part.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place after the incision with powdered zeig, until the blood is gone.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then it should be bound with vinegar, and the place should be cared for with it until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	Translation: On making an incision in the flesh of a newborn on the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often flesh is born on the gum above, which the ancients called abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore you should suspend it with a spoon: or hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the wound run, or bleed.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place it on a place of zeig powder, or other stanching and drying powders.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that flesh returns after healing, for often it returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it: for indeed it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	On the reason of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	Sometimes they gather on the surfaces of teeth from the inner and outer parts, and between the gums rough, discolored, and sometimes yellowish, until that corruption reaches the gum, and the teeth become foul through it.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore you should make the weak one sit between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape off the molar and tooth, in which the roughnesses and sand-like things appear to you: until there is nothing left of them, and likewise do with discoloration, greenness, yellowishness, and other things until they are cleansed.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If therefore that which is at the beginning of their reason is removed, it is good: and if not, then repeat the file on them on another day, secondly, and thirdly, until you reach the end of your desire in it.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth needs filing of various forms, many figures: according to how it is prepared for your operation: because the file with which the tooth is filed from the lower part is different from the file with which it is filed between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	These forms of razors are prepared for you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of toothache.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	You should remove the tooth from its pain with all your skill, and delay in its extraction.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For its root does not fit when it is extracted: because it is a subtle substance: until when there is no excuse for its extraction, then when the sick person must remove it himself, he should do so to strengthen himself and be certain with you about the toothache.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth and remove it: then the pain does not go away, until the weak tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When therefore the sick person himself is certain about the toothache, then you should scarify around the tooth with a sharp lancet, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is dissolved from all parts: then move it with your fingers, or with slender forceps gradually, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place large forceps in that location with good hold, and the head of the sick person between your knees: which you have already held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to straightness, so that you do not break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If therefore it does not come out, then take some of those instruments, and insert it under it from all parts with ease, and try to move it, as you did in the first place.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated, or corroded: then you should fill the hole with a cloth: and tie it with the tip of a slender rod, so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction over it with forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And it is necessary to carefully perform scarification around the circumference of the jaw from all sides by a lot.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And keep your strength, so that it does not break itself, and its part remains, and it returns above the weak one from that greater malice which is more of its pain first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And beware, that you do not do what unknowing phlebotomists do in their haste, and the boldness of them beyond its eradication, besides what they administer which we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For they often happen to people great infirmities, of which some are difficult to break, and all its roots remain, or some of them: or that they extract it with some of the jawbones: as we have often testified about that.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then it should be covered after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If blood flow occurs from the places (for it often happens), then you should wipe a little from zege, and fill with it that place: and if not, burn it if zege does not help you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the fine forceps by which the tooth is moved in the first place, should be long at their extremities, short at the handle, thick, so that they do not duplicate when with them pressed on the tooth: they should be like the thick handles, until when you squeeze with them, they do not bite themselves, nor duplicate: short at their extremities, and made of iron, or of a well-made sharp edge, direct extremities: and in their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter into certain ones, and squeeze with a proper constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they are made like the extremities of the beak of a bird called a stork, and they are strong for constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Translation: On the removal of teeth and the extraction of jawbone fractures.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When a tooth is broken and there remains something under the extraction, then it is necessary to place butter on the affected area for one or two days until the area becomes soft: then introduce lute or forceps, whose tips resemble the beak of a bird called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	However, this is the form of forceps.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their tips are made like a file inside or like an axe.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If therefore it does not submit to you with these forceps, then it is necessary to make a hole above the root and tear the flesh entirely, and introduce the tool called the "small pliers," whose form is as follows:
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	Let it be short in length, somewhat thick: and not wet, so that it does not break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If therefore the root exits through that, it is good: and if not, you must groan with these other tools whose forms are as follows:
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first triangular tip, in which there is a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The form of the fine triangular tip.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also groan with this tool having two branches, whose form is as follows:
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other tools and instruments that preceded in the ratio of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also groan with this tool that resembles a large hook, of this form, a twisted triangular tip, in which there is a certain thickness, so that it does not break: and it is not wet.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And know that there are many tools for teeth: and similarly the other tools are not counted, and the wise craftsman, skilled in his art, has invented by himself the tool according to what signifies to him the operation and the pains of them.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Since from grudges are those things to which the ancients did not speak, due to their diversity in kinds.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	But if the jawbone is broken from the jaw, or from other bones of the mouth, or rots: then examine above it in its place with that which is fitting for him from the instruments and forceps which I mentioned in the extraction of the root, and heal with the one whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	Let there be something of thickness gradually, so that it is bound or held with the jaw, and does not flee and float until the jaw exits: and restore the place with suitable medicines to that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it from its own rot, and heal it, until it is healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the extraction of teeth projecting above others.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth do not project above others according to their natural course, it becomes ugly by that form: and especially when it happens in women, and girls, that is, in virgins.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth is born after another tooth, and does not fit, or is possible to be extracted, nor is it cut: then remove it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar to a small beak, and is made of iron, very sharp at the end.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be where you cut it into many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that another is not moved from the teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is projecting exposed to its own cutting: then cut it with a file with a file, whose form is this.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should all be done from the inside, and the handle of its needles and puncturers should be like a file with which sharp points are made: with which the tooth is gradually cut away over many days with ease, so that the tooth does not move and fall off; then it is gently rubbed, and in the end it is scraped with some rasors.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	But if it is a tooth from which a part is broken off and hurts the tongue: then it is necessary that the edge of it even be filed away, until the roughness of that broken part is evened out; and it should be flattened, and not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the retention of teeth with gold wires.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When it happens to the front teeth that they are shaken and moved by a blow or by chance: and the weak one cannot string over what he eats so that it does not fall out; and you have treated them with stiptics, and the cure has not improved: then the ingenuity in them is, that they should be strung with gold wire: because silver becomes green, and rots after days: but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let the wire be of medium thinness and thickness according to the quantity that it takes between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	Indeed the form of retention is, that you take the wire, and insert a double of it between two healthy teeth: then you weave with both ends of the wire between the moved teeth, whether one is, or more, until you reach with the net up to the healthy tooth of the other part.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the weaving up to the part from which you began: and tie your hand with thinness and wisdom, until it is not moved at all: and your constriction when you string the wire, at the roots of the teeth, so that it does not rot.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors: and gather both ends, and fold them over the gum: and hide each one between the sound tooth and the moving tooth, so as not to wound the tongue: then let it be left thus tight until it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it is dislodged or cut, tie them again with another thread, and let it remain with it thus for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the teeth, and the shape of the bite of two sound teeth, and two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth, or two after the loss of both, returns to its place and is held as we have mentioned, and remains: and this is done only by a skillful and experienced craftsman.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes something is fitted from the bones of cattle: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and is placed in the place from which the tooth is protected and tied, as we have said: and it remains, and is served with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	¶ On cutting the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	Sometimes this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, with which man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already consolidated.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation in it is that you open the mouth of the sick person in his breast, and raise his tongue: then cut this nervous ligament in width, until the tongue is released from its retention.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is something hard and knotted in it, and it is from the consolidation of a wound: then thrust into it a hook, and cut it through width, until you have cut the ligament, and released the knot.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And beware, lest there be a deep cut in the flesh, and you sever an artery there, and blood loss occurs.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then the wound should be covered with a rosewater soaked cloth, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen bandage under the tongue, which the weak person should hold all night: so that it does not consolidate again on the second day.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if blood loss occurs, then place on the wound a poultice of zegi powder.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if indeed the blood overwhelms you, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cauterizer, which is suitable for that: then care for it along with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	¶ On the extraction of a tongue stone that is formed under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Sometimes a tumor occurs under the tongue that resembles a small stone, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function: and perhaps it grows so much, until it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation in it is, that you open the mouth of the sick person before the sun: and consider the tumor.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If therefore you see it of a dark or black color, hard, to which the sick person does not have sense: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then push into it a hook, and cut it with a fine spear, and free it from all part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	But if the blood overwhelms you in your hour of operation, then place on it a poultice of zegi powder, until the blood is cut off: then return to your operation, until you extract it with its fullness.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is soaked with vinegar and salt: and care for it with the rest of the cure that is suitable to that, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	On the Cure of Two Abscesses in the Tonsils.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Sometimes abscesses occur between the throat and the glands, that is, the tonsils, which resemble almonds: and they are called two Tonsils: which when you treat with what we said in division, and do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If therefore it is a hard abscess, of brownish color, with little pain: then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is of red color, and its root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing the flow of blood, indeed leave it, until it ripens.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then either you will pierce it: or it will burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if it is of white color, round, and its root is thin: then it must be pierced.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation in it is, that you consider before the operation of its abscess, if the hot abscess of it has been completed with quiet rest, or it has diminished by some diminution: then therefore make the sick person sit in front of the sun, and his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let him take a servant between his hands, and press his lower tongue with an instrument, whose this is its form.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, which is thin like a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When therefore you press with it the tongue, and the abscess appears to you, and falls on it your sight: then take a hook, and fix it in the tonsil, and draw it out as much as you can, except that you pull with it some from its clothes.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then, cut it with an instrument of this form, which follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is adapted to forceps: however, its extremities should be guarded, so that the opening of each of them is directly opposite and sharp: therefore, care should be taken that it is from iron indo, or alloyed with lead.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula of this form.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one almond, cut the other according to the same method of incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then, after incision, the sick person should gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if blood flow occurs to him, gargle with water in which the bark of beans has been boiled: or myrtle leaves, and similar things from stiptics, until the bleeding is stopped: then care for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And sometimes abscesses arise in the throat other than the two almonds.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut them according to what I said in the incision of two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And indeed, I myself have already healed a woman from an abscess, which was born between her throat, which was pulling to the esophagus, little sense, which had almost closed the throat: and the woman breathed through a narrow opening, and had already stopped her eating, and drinking water: and had arrived at death, if she remained for one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess had risen so much that it had emitted two branches, until they exited through two nostril holes.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore acted swiftly and fixed one of their hooks.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where I had grasped it from the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I did the same to the other one that protruded from the nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened his mouth, and pressed his tongue: and afterwards I fixed a hook into the abscess: then I cut out part of it, and only a little blood came out of it: therefore the throat of the woman was cured, and she immediately began to drink water, and then she took food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore I did not stop cutting out of that abscess many times over a long period of time: and the abscess would take the place of what I was cutting out, until it had been prolonged too much and with it.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	Therefore I devised, and I cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	Therefore she stood up after the addition: then I walked away from that side, and I did not know what God had done with her after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Chapter on the cutting of abscesses in the mouth.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When the catarrh descends to the mouth, and becomes an abscess, and is long: then it is called a perpendicular one: and if it is in the lower part round and large, then it is called a wound.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When it is cured with what we said in the division, and the cure does not come together: and you see that the abscess has become warm and thin: then it is necessary to cut it out.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is gathered from it is round and not long, and is bloody, or of a yellowish or black color, and there is no sensation: then it is necessary to follow the cutting out of it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For it is in that place where there is fear of the weak.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I mentioned from its whiteness and length, you should make the infirm person sit before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument, of which the preceding narration was made: then fix a hook in the wound, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned for incision of the two tonsils.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added above the natural limit without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you cut from it more, you will damage the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision, use that which we mentioned in the incision of the two tonsils: and care for it, until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	But if the infirm person fears the incision: then you must use your skill in cauterizing it without fear and cowardice.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the method of cauterization in it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, that you place the head of the infirm person in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and mix it with unextinguished charcoal, and place it not thick nor thin, and fill the cavity of this instrument, whose form is as follows.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Let the extreme part of it in which the medicine is placed be a hollow, like the hollow of a needle.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on the same hook: and let the infirm person be lying on his side, so that salt may run out from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing may descend from it to his throat, and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you should apply it to the first part of the wound, in the amount of half an hour, until you see that it has become discolored and the pain of the medicine has been relieved.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take a probe, and wrap it with cloth, and pour the probe with the medicine, and insert the probe with the cloth into a tube from above, until the cloth sticks to the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of that wound.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: for it will dry up and fall off after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	But if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe around the wound with cloth dampened in butter, and clean it with what is around it from the medicine: and moisten it with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	And it will be healed externally with an ointment, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore this kind of treatment is healthier than incision and further from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes the wound is also healed with that which is finer than cauterization and incision: it is healed with smoking, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take a poultice, and hyssop, and origanum, and rue, and seaweed, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar herbs to these: and gather all of them, or some of them in a pot, and immerse them with vinegar, and boil: and the pot should be glazed with clay properly: and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, above which a concave instrument is placed according to this way.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Make it from silver or copper: and its tip is inserted into the mouth of the sick person, where there is a lemon, until the vapor rises to the nostril through the tube, until the nostril becomes obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then repeat this process on it many times, until it dries out.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not make this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of abscesses.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For it rather adds to the abscess: and you should not make this unless at the decline of its hot stage.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If however this instrument is not present to you, then take a tube, and place in its tip some wool: so that the mouth of the sick person will not be burned: because the wool prevents the vapor from burning the mouth: and this is from good treatment with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	¶ On the extraction of thorns from the throat, and bones.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Often a bone or thorn of a fish, or other thing, sticks in the throat.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore you must extract what is apparent on top of which it falls, after you have placed your tongue with the instrument under the sun, and it is declared to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you must make the sick person vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the attached thing will come out through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or the sick person may swallow a piece of bone, or the stem of lettuce, or a dry crust of bread: or he may receive a piece of dried sea sponge gently, and then tie it with a thread, and then swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it has reached the place where the thorns, or bone, are, and is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If therefore it does not exit with that which we said, then use the tool made of lead according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	Let it be larger than the radius by a little, and at its end there should be a narrowness which will enter into his throat with ease: and he himself should have his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And beware of his own epiglottis, so that it does not happen to him coughing, and he pushes with it, or a spindle, or inserts himself the physician with his own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But that the sick person inserts, this is better: because of his knowledge of the location of the attached thing: and he pushes downwards, or draws his hand with the instrument upwards, all that second according to the quantity which is prepared for him, until it exits.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	§ On the extraction of a leech.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is treated with it which we said in division from cure with medicines, and does not attach, then consider in the throat of the sick person before the sun, or at the sun after you have placed his tongue with the instrument which I told you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If therefore your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with a delicate instrument.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible with them: then take a hollow needle, and insert it into the throat of the sick person up to near the throat: then insert into the hollow of the needle burning iron with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and the sick person should avoid all water for the whole day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then he should receive a full glass of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and cover his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it: and move the water one hour after another with his hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	Bloodletting is immediately affected when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If, however, it does not exit with what we mentioned, then smoke the infirm person with cicadas, or with assa foetida using the instrument we mentioned in the smoking of the wound.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, because it will fall itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in smoking is, that you take a pot in which there are live prunes with fire: and the pot should be covered with a covering, in which there is a hole: and it should be arranged in that hole the end of the instrument.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the smoking, and place the infirm person's mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the smoking does not exit, until you know that the smoking has reached the bloodsucker.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the bloodsucker will immediately fall.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the smoking often.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the infirm person should tolerate thirst, and eat with salt, and mallows, and not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	It is therefore necessary that it exit with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which the bloodsucker is drawn from the throat, when it falls on it with its sight.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to forceps, as you see: unless that it has this curve which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to the beak of a bird which is called a stork, in which there is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not let it go entirely.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening of abscesses, and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	Abscesses are of many kinds, of many modes, according to how the remembrance of them comes, namely one, and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation, and section from two modes.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is of the kind of boils that exist within themselves and which include moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second method is due to the locations where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	Because a boil that occurs in the head is different from a boil that occurs in the anus, and a boil that occurs in fleshy places is different from a boil that occurs in joints, and each of them has its own judgment according to its operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from boils are those that do not require to be lanced unless after the maturation of pus in them and its suppuration: and from them are those that require to be lanced while they are raw and not matured according to their suppuration.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	Such as boils that are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because a boil when it occurs near a joint, and persists to be its existence until it putrefies what is in its vicinity perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint's connection are corrupted: therefore this is a cause for contraction of that limb.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or it is a boil at the main member: for if you delay its lancing until it matures, it will harm either him or through that main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or it is near the anus, lance therefore it immature: and it is not necessary to lance a raw boil that is not fully digested, except that which is near the anus so that it does not putrefy deeply and extend to the interior of the anus and become a fistula or become in its end that is not healed.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary to know the time of lancing boils that have matured according to their suppuration: and it is at the cessation of pain, recession of fever, and diminution of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the head's boil: and other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary to make the same incision in the lower part of the abscess and its most prominent elevation: and let the incision be made lengthwise along the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the back, and in the tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But in those things which are reflected, go with the incision according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when the abscess is in fleshy places, it is better to let the incision of it go until its digestion is confirmed, as we said according to the complement,
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many and filthy discharges, and perhaps its lips are hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some abscesses are incised according to the width of the body at necessity: or according to that by which the member needs.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary for the attendant to make a small incision in small abscesses, and a wide incision in large abscesses: or many cuts according to the similarity of the size of the abscesses.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are abscesses from which the skin must be concaved: and it is incised when it has been made like a garment, and has become in the end, which is already dead: like that which happens in many, so that they doubt, and in buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those which are cut with a cut having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And there is one from which it is incised like the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Like the inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And there are those in which the incision is circular, and the lunar incision: and similar to them from the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	That which does not have a head, such as soft, shallow abscesses, should be pierced with a shallow, flat incision.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And when the abscess is large and has already collected a lot of pus, it should be pierced so that you do not rush and remove all the pus at once, but rather remove some of it from that part.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then leave the abscess alone until another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then remove some more of the pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this repeatedly according to the gradation until it is all out, especially if the patient is weak and lacking in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man: for the animal spirit often dissolves with the exit of pus, and perhaps the weak one dies, and you will not notice.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore pay great attention to this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And after your incision, by which you have pierced these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If therefore the wound is small or a flat incision, then apply lint from linen, or old cotton.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the abscess is large and there are many incisions, then you must insert lint into every incision until they all meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess, or have scooped it out: then you must fill it with old cotton, or as when a garment is sewn, or shorn of its wool without moisture: and bind it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then raise it up, and care for it with what is necessary from an ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If bleeding occurs during your surgical procedure, then apply cold water and vinegar to the cloth after it has absorbed the blood, and place it repeatedly on the wound.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If the bleeding persists, then you must apply the treatment and cure, as I have mentioned in various places of this book, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If it is during the winter season and there are many boils on the skin: then you must pour in powders with wine and warm oil, and place them on the affected areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is during the summer and there are fleshy areas: then you must place powders soaked in water and oil, or with wine and oil, and make the whole thing cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we said, then you must dissolve the boils and cleanse it, and apply the treatment that is appropriate for its healing until it is healed.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary for the universal knowledge of the treatment of boils.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	Indeed, according to the method of distinction, I have already said about every boil, how the way to its cure is taken up separately in each chapter.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	¶ About the incision of boils that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	Chapter 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Small boils occur on the skin of the head, and are of the kind of nodes that contain the tunics which are like their sacks: as if they were themselves plucked chickens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And there are many of these kinds.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	From these there are fleshy ones: and from these there are those that contain moisture similar to lime: and from these there are those that contain moisture similar to flour and porridge: and from these there are similar ones, and from these there are those that are hard like stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	In all cases of cutting and their removal, there is no fear as long as one does not perform the cut opposite an artery.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	The operation in their cutting is to try it with the instrument whose form comes after these, which is called the "Intrumissus", until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it contains moisture, then dry it with a cut according to the length of the surface cut: in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with a cut from line b to line g. When the moisture is drained, then scrape off the shell that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything from it completely.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For often it returns if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will consume what remains from the shell.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat over it with Egyptian ointment second and third, and if you need it, until you trust that nothing remains from the shell, then care for the wound with ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the abscess contains a fat knot: then dry it according to this form, with a cut having the form of a cross: and insert pins between the sides of the cut, and scrape it from all parts: and try your strength in extracting the tunic that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	But if it makes a contradiction for you, an artery, then do what I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And likewise do in a stone abscess, from the cut and cure, as we said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	This section on lapidary abscess is easier: because it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	Sometimes there are certain abscesses among these people, in which there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is: because I cut open an abscess on the head of an old woman, and found an abscess like a solid and hard, rough, white stone, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with it throwing, it would wound him.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in other abscesses that occur on the head, namely those that occur in the heads of children, and at the roots of the ears, this section is all surface.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Or make an incision in them always from the lower part of them, so that the course of the pus may be relieved to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then take care of those with what is suitable for their cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	§ On the incision of Strophularia in the neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And over those that occur in the neck, there is one and many: and they are generated from each other: and every Strophula from them is within its own tunic, as is in knots and abscesses of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the species of these Strophularia are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For from them there are stony ones: and from them there are those that contain moisture: and from them there are evil ones, which do not obey the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that one therefore which you see of good disposition in touch, whose color is near the skin, and moves to all parts, and is not annexed with the nerves of the neck, nor with the ganglia, nor with the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to cut it with a shallow incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line b. to a line g., and scrape it from all parts: and extend two lips of skin with a needle, or with many needles, if you need that, as we said in abscesses of the head, and extrahe it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is a precaution that the vein or nerve does not get caught.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the incision be not too sharp: so that it does not add to your hand with the incision, or disturb the weak, and you cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	But if you cut the vein or artery, and it prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound some triturated zegium powder, or some powders that stop bleeding, and tie the wound, and leave it until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound becomes soft: or it begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For the blood is stopped then. So return to your operation until you complete it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then with your index finger, check if there is anything remaining from the strophuli or small ones: so cut them and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	But if there is a large vein in the root of the strophuli: then it is necessary that you do not cut that strophuli from its root: but it is necessary that you tie it with a strong doubled thread, and leave it until it falls off without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the wound with old cataplasm that you have already immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	But if the strophuli is cut entirely, then it is necessary that you gather the two wound lips: and suture it immediately, after you see that there is no remaining excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	But if you see that there is remaining excess due to the size of the strophuli, then it is necessary that you extend to cutting its root, and removing it: and administer the suture that we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And what contains moisture from the strophuli, puncture it with a superficial puncture: so that you see its place of maturity to you: and place the puncture below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	After perforation, apply liniment with ointment and similar substances to cauterize the remaining part affected by corruption until you see that the wound is clean. Then treat the wound with a generative ointment of flesh until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	On Sectioning the Epiglottis from an Abscess within the Throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients performed this sectioning of the epiglottis, and I have not seen anyone in our land who has done it; and this is the written account of their words.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those who have a synanche, it is necessary to avoid sectioning the epiglottis because a tracheotomy cannot be performed through it; since all veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, throat, or both jaws when there is no illness in the canal, it is necessary to perform sectioning of the epiglottis to escape from the danger that occurs from the praefication.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to do it, we should section the epiglottis under three or four circles of the epiglottis by a small cut along its width, in the part between two circles by an amount that is a section in the cartilage, not in the cartilage: and this location is convenient for sectioning because it is free from flesh, and the veins are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	However, if the physician is afraid, then it is necessary to stretch the skin of the throat with a lancet.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he should flatten the skin until he reaches the canal: avoid the veins if he sees anything from them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he should cut the cartilage that we mentioned: and it is indicated to cut the canal from the phlegm that escapes from it, because it is broken, and the division of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And leave an open wound at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the prefication is removed at the time when it is feared, gather the two lips of the wound together and heal the skin alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis says.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The summary of this narrative that we have told is not an explanation unless when they see that some of these abscesses has already filled the throat of the sick person: and the sick person was raised up over death, and wanted to be cut off from his breathing: they go to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe on the place of the wound with some breathing, and be saved from death: and for this reason they ordered to leave the open wound until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and almost itself: then they ordered to heal the wound and cure it until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw myself is that one maidservant took a knife and sent it with her into her throat, and cut the part of the trachea.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called for her cure, and I found her groaning, as is the groaning of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Then I untied her from the wound, and I found blood that had gone out of the wound in a small amount.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Then I was afraid that she had not cut the vein, nor stopped it: and wind was going out of the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Then I hurried and healed her wound, until it was healed: and nothing happened to the maidservant except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after days to a better condition of her affairs.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	I therefore say: that in the section of the Epiglottis there is no fear.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	Of the section of the hernia of the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This apostema called hernia of the throat, is a large apostema according to the color of the body: and it is much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it is according to two modes: either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	In the natural certainly there is no skill.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	But in the accidental indeed there are two modes: of which one is similar to the fat knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other mode, is similar to the apostema that is made from the bending of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And in it is fear, and it is not necessary that a presumption be made to it with iron, unless in that which is small: and you probe it, and investigate it with the intromission.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If therefore you find it similar to the fat knot, and it is not suspended with any vein: then cut it, as they are cut off the knots: and extract it with that which contains from the chest, if it is in the chest: and if not, then scrutinize all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with that which is necessary from the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	Of the section of the kind of knots.
Caput XLV.	Chapter 45.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many kinds of knots, and I have already said all the kinds of them in the division: and it is necessary that I tell here the difference between a knot, and an ulcer: since it causes doubt.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when an ulcer is heat, and fever, and very sharp pains, until the boiling over of the superfluity is quieted, and the putrefaction is completed: then indeed the fever and the heat are quieted.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When there is a knot, there is no heat, fever, or pain, and it contains them in their own sifachin, which is their own sack and is according to the color of the body: and its beginning is like chickpeas, and it becomes like broad beans, and greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are according to two species: either fat: or they contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when you come to the cure of the knot, you must experiment with it and inquire about it first with the instrument called Intromissus, according to its form as it comes in the chapter that follows.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of investigating the abscess and all knots is, that you take this instrument and insert it into a moister place, which you find in the abscess: and you turn your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then extract Intromissus, and consider what comes out at its tread.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If therefore it comes out running moisture, whatever color it is: then dry it with a shallow cut, according to what I said in the other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if moisture does not come out at the tread of Intromissus, then you know that it is fat: then dry it with a cut having the form of a cross, according to this form, as I taught you: and suspend it with hooks, and excoriate the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the sac if you can over it, so that you may extract it whole with the knot.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the sac is torn by the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, often this happens: then extract it in pieces, until there remains nothing from it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if something remains from it, either too little or too much, it returns to the knot as much as possible.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it wounds you and something remains from it too little: then fill the wound with certain corrosive powders at your completion, and tie the wound, and place on top of it what sits apostema hot, and care for it with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If therefore it is a large knot, then cut its two lips, and care for it with that which fleshens.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	But if it is contrary to you vein pulsatilis, or not pulsatilis: then hurry, and fill the place zegi ground, and let it be tied for two days, or three, until the wound rots, and the boiling of blood stops: then return to cutting that which remains from the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Paragraph on external instruments for cutting and piercing.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	From them are the forms of intromissors, and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For from them is the large one, and from them is the medium one, and from them is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made from iron awl of square ends properly, so that they quickly enter into the apostema.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of experiens, and no, that is, piercing: and one of them is called beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For from them is the large one, and the medium one, and the small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are used, so that they investigate through them the apostemata, and the exits, and the fistulas, and the bubones from that which is between them from the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are made round, clean, soft, like the large awls which have seats, from citrine indeed, or from air, or from iron, or from silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And better among them are those that are made from citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	They are also made from black lead, which they use to experiment with fistulas, whose concavity is a reflection, so that they reflect gently with their own reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	Because from them are the long ones, from them the medium ones, and from them the short ones, according to the extent of the length of the fistula and its tightness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The shape of the Uncins, and they are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	Because from them are the simple ones, that is, those with one curvature: and they are three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are the blind Uncins: and they are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are the Uncins with two curvatures, and they are three kinds: and from them are the Uncins with three curvatures, and they are three kinds: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of Scalpels, with which they cut and scrape Nodes, and abscesses: and they are three kinds: because from them is large, medium, and small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities by which the section is made are sharp, other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except that with them is made a gentle touch in scraping Nodes at the fear of incision of the vein, or nerve: and that the sick person may be healed by it, and find a little tranquility from the burning which he found at scraping abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are Magdas, and they are three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made from air, and they are similar to the Rod, with which is made alcohol: and in the broad extremity is a hidden Spatula point: and in it runs to the insides, and to the outsides when you want, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the boils that are hidden between the fingers, at the opening of the pustule: and they do not feel them by the sick: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The shape of the wounds from which blood flows: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made of air, or yellow, round, to a certain length, as you see: and let they be at the subtlety.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these species of wounds from which blood flows be large and small with you: so as to cut through them the blood with speed at need, and then when there is not present for you the medicine.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	But you will not use them in the cutting of blood in every place of the body, and you will not use unless in fleshy places: as the arms of the legs, and the hips, and the arms of the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar to them, from fleshy places, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they are made of them small instruments similar to the shells of nuts, according to their shape: through which blood is cut when it flows from the place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they are made of them round according to this form.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	About the care of the breasts of men which resemble the breasts of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of certain men swell at the fullness of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble the breasts of women: and remain pustulous fiercely.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Whoever abhors that, it is necessary for him to cover the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from point b to line a, and then remove all the fat.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the wound with flesh-colored medicament.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather both wound lips together with a suture, and care for it until it is healed.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the breast leans towards the lower parts and becomes soft due to its size, as often happens with women: then it is necessary for him to make two incisions in the upper two sides of his breasts, each containing one on either side near their ends, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form from point b to line a, g. Afterwards remove the skin that is between the two lips, and take off all the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If however he cannot complete the incision that is necessary to make, due to the agitation of the sick person, or due to the flow of blood: then it is necessary for him to fill the wound with a dissolving ointment submerged, and leave it, until it corrodes what remains of the fat.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	Concerning the piercing of abscesses, which happens under the nipple.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These abscesses which happen under the nipple are from a kind of hard Strophularia, which contains pustules, and from these are those which contain moistures.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Those therefore which are from those which contain moistures, it is necessary for them to be dried with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from point b to line a, g. When however all that is in the abscess is evacuated through pus, then fill it with old ointment, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then remove the bandage and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the type of Strophularia blisters, then cut it above, as we said in the section on Strophularia evenly.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If the wound extends so that it can discharge pus, then apply a cautery to it according to what we said in the one that was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On incising abscesses that occur due to artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is ruptured and the skin that is above it is consolidated, an abscess often occurs from this: and similarly, an abscess and swelling also occur in veins.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the artery and vein, are: because when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, gathered deep in the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a noise to it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein, is round in the obvious body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And incision on this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and groins, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great very much.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore it should be avoided with iron, and that which is from them also at the extremities, or at the head, should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	On that which is from them due to swelling of the artery opening, find in the skin incision in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the incision with hooks, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is stripped.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then introduce the needle under it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place that is between two ligaments with a lancet, until all the blood that is in it comes out and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off; afterwards care for it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you must hold with your hand what is possible to remove from the abscess and the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then introduce the needle under the place that you held with your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it, until you remove it from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie it with the abscess with a good ligature: according to what I told you about tying a vein from two parts with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then introduce another needle with another thread under the abscess entirely near the incision of the needle: press and tie your thread in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the abscess in the middle of it, until when it comes out what is in it: then cut the excess skin and let go what is tied from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then place on it the swab that you immersed in wine and oil.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then administer the treatment that is made with linen and ointment until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	About an abscess that happens due to the twisting of nerves.
Caput L.	Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Just as it happens that an abscess forms in an artery and vein, similarly, an abscess can form in nerves. This occurs in them due to a blow or from excessive labor, and the like. It is most common in the regions of helpers, such as the heel, and in every place where the joints move. And it is a severe abscess.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to that of the rest of the body, and it occurs in many positions without pain. And when it is pressed with intensity, the sick person feels in it a sensation similar to a stupor.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And it is not an aggregated abscess in the deep part of the body, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not go towards the front or before, nor behind to the back parts.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Therefore, what is in the joints, it is not necessary to pierce with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps contraction may occur.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is from them in the head, or in the forehead, pierce the skin with a small knife.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If therefore it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps, and cut it away from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it off. Then remove it, and suture the wound with a stitch: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur in the belly.
Caput LI.	Chapter Ll.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Sometimes many people have in their bellies and in the rest of their bodies, tumors, which are called mushrooms, due to a likeness of them to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	Whose root is thin, and their head is thick, and their lips are turned over.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And there are also those who are few in number: and there are also those who are highly praised.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And indeed I have seen a man, and in his belly were two thelils, which were more similar to other things than anything else: there was no difference between them, they were white, with small roots, and they opposed their lips, and they found each other, and moisture always flowed from them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	I therefore cut into them, and I found in the weight of one as if it were X and VIII ounces and in the other as if it were VI ounces. And the operation in their incision is, that you consider then, if the sick person is humid, and the color of the thelil is white, moist, subtle root: then cut him with a broad spatula, and there be cauterization in your presence in fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often blood is driven out from his incision: therefore if the blood overcomes you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	But if you see the sick person afraid and timid from the incision with iron, then take a thread made of lead properly, and tie with it athelul: whose mode we have said, and let him be for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the lead seal.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	Therefore do not cease to tie the lead, as often as it is pressed into the thelil, until it is cut off and falls by itself without labor.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the thelil is thick of root, then in its incision there is a certain fear and timidity: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless it is possible to cut into its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for it, until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware of presuming to incise a thelil which is of a dark color, few sensations, and foul appearance, for indeed it is a cancerous abscess: and I will come with a memory of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	On the care of the prominent umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	The umbilicus becomes prominent for many reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the skin, which is above the abdomen: and it exits through it an abscess, or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows from the vein, or artery, according to what was previously mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the fatness enclosed in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	But if it is due to a skin fissure, and the outlet is thin: then it is of a similar color to an abscess: and it is gentle, painless: and appears to be in different positions.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the outlet of the intestine, then its position is with that which we have mentioned, of greater diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	Therefore when you presume to touch it with your fingers, it disappears: then it returns, and perhaps it is with it a sound: and it is much magnified at the entrance of the bath, and the laborious movement.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	But if it is due to moisture, it is gentle: then it does not disappear when you presume to touch it with your hand, nor is there any binding, nor addition.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	But if it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears to be of a dark color from the slope.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	But if it is due to flesh born: then it is a heavy, thick, hard abscess, and it is shaped according to one quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is due to its moisture, then its touch is gentle.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in it is such that you should consider then, if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to blood from the Artery, or Vein, or moisture: then it is necessary to be prevented from its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in that there is fear and fear, as I taught you in the chapter in which I said about abscesses due to the Artery and Vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	But if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine, or feces: then it is necessary to command the weak one, as much as he holds his breath, and stands extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with the cauterizing iron around the umbilicus of the whole.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then command him to lie down supine between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround with a flat broad spatula around the umbilicus over the place that you marked with the cauterizing iron.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the middle of the abscesses to the upper parts, with a large needle.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him around the strong place with thread, or with a silk cord from a firm ligament: and let there be a knot of the bound ligament.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the middle of the abscesses extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If indeed you find it already caught by the ligament: then remove the bound one, and insert your index finger into it, and push the intestine to the interior of the belly: and if you find feces, then take it with a needle, and cut its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	But if the opposite is against you, the Artery, or Vein: then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them. And insert two needles into the circle that you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the abscess in four places on the needle: and if you wish, remove the needle and let the place go until the flesh rots and falls off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with what is necessary from the ointments until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the protuberance of the navel is from the flesh or from moisture: then it is necessary to hollow out the abscess as we said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And extract the blood, or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then care for that with what is necessary to harden the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	¶ On the care of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 53.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already said about the division of the species of cancer and how the way to its cure with medicines is: and one must be careful with it when curing it with iron, so that it does not become inflamed: and we said about a cancer generated in the womb, and the precaution from its cure.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it is possible to eradicate it: such as cancer which is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and similar places from movable members to extract all of it: especially when it is beginning to be small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it is old, and is large, one should not approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not cure anyone from that: nor did I see any who came to it before me.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it when it is located as we said is, that one goes before and dissolves the sick from black bile several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then, if you find the phlebotomy needle itself with a clear sign of fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick person with preparation, in which it will be placed with operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then introduce into the cankered teeth that are suitable for him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, hollow him from all parts with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of his roots: and let the blood run out, and do not cut him off quickly, but express the spots and wipe off the whole thick blood with your hand, or with whatever is possible there from instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the thick blood flow from the incision of the artery, or vein, makes you contrary, then cauterize the vein until it is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ About the Care of Hydropsy.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter 41.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	Now we have spoken about the division of the species of Hydropsy, and how the accumulation of water is made: and all the signs of each species, and its cure with remedies.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are cured with iron are only the species of ascites alone: and it does not approach with iron of the species of tympanites: nor of the species of hyposarca completely, for that is deadly.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already cured this species of Hydropsy tympanites with remedies, and your treatment has not added: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the sick person has already followed weakness, or is with him another infirmity besides Hydropsy: as if it is with him coughing, or dissolution of the belly, and similar things: then beware that you do not treat him with iron: for that is fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	If you see an individual of robust health, except for Hydropism alone, and he is neither a child nor an elderly person, then the method of operation on him is as follows: you should lift up the sick person standing between your hands, and the assistant behind him should express his bowels by pushing water down with his hand towards the lower part of the beard.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a sharp sponge in this shape.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	It should be shaped like the two sharp ends of a long, sharp-ended sponge.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, it should have a certain brevity gradually, so that you do not pass through him with him up to the intestine, and injure it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of Hydropism is from the part of the intestines, then you should extend with the cutting from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards directly above the beard.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of Hydropism is due to pain in the liver: then your cut should be on the left side from the navel by three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of Hydropism is due to the spleen, then your cut should be on the right side: and you should not even make a cut in the side where the sick person wants to lie, so that superfluities do not flow to that weaker place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument through the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that cut, and elevate your hand with the sponge between the skin and flesh, as if you are scraping it: and let the quantity that scrapes be the quantity of a nail, or about that.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the flesh until the sponge reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then remove it and insert the instrument of this form into the hole.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or copper, or gold, and is thin and clean: it has a small hole on its lower part, and on its sides there are three holes, two on one side and one on the other: and its tip is cut according to the shape of a pen, as you see: at its upper end is a ring.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches the water, then the water immediately flows down on the instrument, so you should suck out the water from the instrument in the middle of an hour's time.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you suck out more than necessary from it, the weak person may die of exhaustion or suffer from other symptoms that approach death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But suck out from it according to its strength and according to the symptoms that the weak person shows you, indicating their condition by its pulse and its nature.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	This is because it should be retained immediately due to the skin that retains the hole that is on the side of the syringe: of which I have spoken, so you should pierce it in that way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the process with the instrument on the second day, if you see that the weak person is able to tolerate it: and also remove a small amount of water from the water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this for several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there is only a little left in the water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the weak person, and release a large amount of water from the water: then care for him with burial in hot sand, and much sweating in the bath and sun, and wait for his thirst: and care for him with dry medicines until he is healed: and cauterize above the stomach, and epar, and spleen, after the extraction of water: according to what I have spoken about it before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	On the care of children who are born in places where their urinary openings are not pierced.
Caput LV.	Chapter 55.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When someone of the children is born from the belly of his mother, and the head of his muzzle is not pierced, or is narrow, or is not in its place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore one must assist with the piercing of it immediately after he is born with a thin, very sharp knife, according to this shape.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a thin sling of lead in the opening and tie it up: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When therefore he wants to emit urine, remove it, and mix.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place lead, already possible is that the urine which flows over the place, does not allow it to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But he whose opening is narrow, he is treated with lead, as we said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those in which the opening is not in its place, they are hurt.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	That is, because from those who are born, the opening is at the end of the hair of the maiden: therefore he cannot mix to the anterior, until he raises the hair with his hand to the upper parts.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And he has no generation, therefore, because the semen cannot reach the mother according to the straightness: and it is a very shameful illness.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in him is, that the weak one be bent over his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of his maiden with your left hand by strong extension, and cut the head of the maiden from the place of the penis, with a sharp point, or with a thin sharp knife: as is the cutting of a reed, or as you cut something, that the middle of it comes similar to the head of the maiden: and so that the opening falls in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And provide for yourself during your surgical procedure from blood loss.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, apply to it with that which stops blood flow and care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Of white spots that occur on the foreskin and hair of the head, and corruption, blackening, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Head 65.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These white spots often occur on the face, and there is a disfiguring of flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it, one is malignant, and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, do not remove the non-malignant one with a fine knife, and cut it off, until you cleanse it entirely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then apply over it a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian oil.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the oil of daffodil, until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the white spot is malignant, of foul color, then you should apply a cauterizing instrument after its incision and its own razor.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If the white spot is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and it is part of the white spot inside the foreskin, and part outside: then you should remove the white spot that is inside first, until when it becomes solidified, then care for it externally: because when you care for it simultaneously, the foreskin does not become secure so that it will not protrude.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And now also occur in the testicles, and blackening and corruption of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should scrape off everything that is already blackened, and what wants to become corrupted, or is already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then apply a line over it after that with honey that has been ground with flour of chickpeas, and crushed herbs of the sieve.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that (wound) along with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, there is bleeding, then apply the cauterizing iron with a crescent-shaped iron, in this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cauterizing iron is a tool with two positions at once, namely for bleeding and when the wound is decaying.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If it corrodes the head of the woman and destroys everything in an hour: then you must insert a lead tube into the urethral opening, so that the weak one can urinate over it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In adherence of the foreskin with the head of the woman, and this adherence does not occur unless in him whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required above it: and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess: therefore you must scrape it with a blunt spatula, until the ligament is dissolved, and the head of the woman is freed from all parts.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish that exactly, then you must scrape something from the head of the woman and from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	Because the foreskin when it is thin, perhaps it is pierced due to its thinness quickly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the woman with a linen cloth that is already made wet in cold water, so that they do not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then treat it with a styptic wine until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	About the cleaning of infants and treatment from the error that happens to them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 77.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not the solution of continuity, as other wounds: but since it is from our operation, our will, and its use is proper for boys, it is necessary that we mark in this operation a better sign and a path leading more easily to salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say therefore that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	Which is because I have found that the majority of craftsmen and bleeders use cleansing by circumcision with a needle, and with forceps; and they use those who are affected, and those who tie with thread, and those who cut with a lancet.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I myself have already proved all these methods, and I have not found a better cleansing with forceps, and tying with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	Because often the skin escapes in cleansing with a needle.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	Because the skin of the prepuce has two layers: perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains: therefore it is necessary to cut again and cause future pain.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And with cleansing that is done by those who are affected, that is, by hand, which tailors use, the cut at the end of the male member's limb is not secured: because perhaps it enters into its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in cleansing with a lancet, perhaps it avoids the iron, and corrupts your operation: and the skin of the child is short by nature, and often they are born thus, which do not need cleansing: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in cleansing with forceps, and tying with thread, a good experiment has shown to me: because forceps are proportional to the cut: therefore, because the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	Therefore when you place your hand, two sharpnesses are proportional, and they cut according to one operation at one time: and a compression of similar figure is made, containing the skin of the maiden from all parts, with which there is no error at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The proper method of operation is to test the boy, especially if he understands a little, by tying a string around his finger, which you do not do unless you tie it on his own finger and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him happy and joyful in every way possible for you, because he receives his understanding from it.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and do not let him sit: and hide the needles in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy sees nothing at all, and does not see any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his finger, and blow on the skin, and pull it upwards until the head of the finger comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it from what accumulates in it dirtiness.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then tie it a little below with another ligature.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger and thumb, keeping the lower ligature well, and cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift the skin up quickly, and remove the head of the finger.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros. Recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood flow slowly (it is better), and put powder on top: and above the powder a cloth in which the expanded vein was cooked in rose water, shaken with rose oil. Then apply it fresh and good: and let him go on top of it until another day: and take care of the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	But the form of the needle for cleansing is this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	They should be sharp at both ends and pointed: so that the branch of the claw does not protrude from them: and the length of the two points should be as long as the length of the two handles equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	The error that occurs during cleaning is: perhaps the whole skin has completely escaped, or a part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, you should extend it with your own finger and nail before the formation of an abscess at that location, and cut it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your own finger and nail, then remove it with a hook and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	But if more than three days have passed and there remains what is under the knife inflated, it is an abscess: then let it go until the abscess is warm and seated, and scrape it with facility, and cut it according to what is prepared for you: and beware of the tip of the knife.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore take care of it with that which consolidates the wound from the powders which we have mentioned in the treatise on powders: and if it is cut through the skin above measure, and avoids the upper parts, it does not harm it even then.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore take care of it with that which we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	¶ On the extraction of a retained stone in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Urinary retention in the bladder occurs from an obstruction made of stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and similar to those which we have mentioned from methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if the stone is not solved, and you see that its retention is due to the stone which is already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary for him to be lying on his knees cared for.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then his feet are placed on his back, and he extends his belly from the upper part of his back, and binds his weak breath as much as possible to him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Therefore, when the neck of the bladder is turned towards the removal of a stone, it is relieved by the Vrine.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not relieved by the method we mentioned and the condition is very strong, then the assistant of the extraction should use an instrument called a siringa, which has this form: It should be made of silver, and be thin, light, concave like the quill of a bird in its subtlety, long in the likeness of the palm of one's hand and middle finger: it should have a thin cannula in its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the method of exit through it is as follows: you should take a doubled thread and a ligature at its end, or cotton, a good ligature: and insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the siringa: and if there is any excess from the wool, but insert it into the cannula with force, as one would do with a needle.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then anoint the siringa with oil, or with butter, and with white lead: and make the infirm person sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder, and its staff with wet oils, and oil of olives, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the siringa into the staff with ease, until it reaches the root of the staff.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above from the navel part.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the siringa inside it, until it reaches the bladder, and the infirm person feels that it has already reached an empty space: and this is not done in this order unless the passage, through which it goes, is where there is twisting.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the Vrine will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then, remove it and make the patient run a thread of silk through the urinary tract: and repeat the stringing, and do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied and the weak one finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of the bladder with Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulcer occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is constricted in it, and water and medicines are desired to distill into it: then make with an instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And a hollow place, in which is that which pushes, should be according to the amount that will push it without addition, until when something is drawn with it, water is attracted: and when it is pushed, it expels it far: as Clepsydra does, with which naphta, that is, Greek fire in battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	Therefore when you want to project water into the bladder, insert the end of Clepsydra into the water, and draw with it what pushes to the upper parts, for water is drawn into the hollowness of Clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert its end into a reed, as we have told you in the stringing.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push water with it because that water has reached the bladder immediately, so that the weak one feels it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The shape of the delicate catheter by which the bladder is catheterized.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make it from silver or gold: whose head is higher and more like a woman's breast, and under which there are folds where the band can lie.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take a sheep's bladder and put it in the moisture you want to use to moisten the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it between two folds with a strong rope and double thread: and warm that moisture slightly over the fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the end of the catheter into the urethra, afterwards tie your hand on the bladder with moisture with a proper binding, until he feels weak, that that moisture has already reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	But if you do not have a bladder present for you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread through those holes, as they roll.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle, like an oyster: afterwards you put it in it what you want from moistures, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and make with it as you made with the bladder from expression with your hand, until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On extracting a Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapter 60
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	Now we have spoken of the division of the species of the stone, and its cure with medicines: and I said the difference between a stone formed in the kidneys, and the bladder, and the signs of all that: and I said the stone in which the operation with hand and cutting falls: and it is a stone properly formed in the bladder: and that which is shaped in the urethra: and I am narrating that with manifest explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say therefore that a stone generated in the bladder, very often happens to children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is known that the urine flows out of the bladder like water in its fineness: and there appears in it white sand, and the weak man rubs his rod against it, and struggles with it, and often hangs on it.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then he is raised up, and flows out with it the rectum in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is easy to cure children from this until they reach fourteen years old.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But it is medium in young people, in that which is between this: and whose stone is larger, cure is easier: and if small, it is the opposite of its cure.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When therefore we come to the cure, it is necessary first, that we cleanse the weak man with a clyster, which extracts all the feces that are in his intestines: for that when sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during inspection.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the sick man should be taken with his feet, and shaken, and moved towards the lower parts: so that the stone may descend to the bottom of the bladder, or jump from a high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands be under his buttocks, so that the bladder may become all sloping towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then seek him out, and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If therefore you feel the stone in the space, then hasten immediately with a cutting above it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not fall under your touch at all, then it is necessary that you wipe the finger indicating with the oil of your left hand, if the sick man is a child: or the middle finger if he is a young man complete: and introduce it into his anus, and seek out about the stone, until it is under your finger: and turn him gradually to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger and push it towards the external location against which you wish to make the incision: and order the assistant to press on the anus with his hand, and order another assistant to extend the testicles with his right hand towards the upper part: and with his left hand, to remove the skin that is under the testicles in the part away from the location where the incision is to be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the spatula, which has the following form.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the side of the left buttock: and let the incision be made over it on a stone, and your finger be in the anus: and let the incision be made crosswise, so that it may be an external incision wide, and an internal incision narrow, according to the possible size of the stone's exit.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	For perhaps your finger, which is in the anus, may press against the stone at the incision, and exit without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you should know that from the stone are the angles and margins, therefore it is difficult for its exit because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from that is smooth, similar to a gallbladder, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, for those who have angles and margins, add in the incision.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit in this way, then it is necessary to place a forceps over it: or to tie it above with a bandage, the end of which is like the moon, which ties over the stone, and does not slip from it: or to insert an instrument under it, curved at its end.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If however you cannot place it above with a bandage, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something bites you from the blood, cut it off with scissors.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If indeed the stone is larger than one, then drive the first large one against the bladder's bone.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut above it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards drive a small one after that, and similarly do if there are many by two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If it is rather large, then it is a mistake to separate above it with a large cut.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens to the feeble one of two things, either that he dies, or it happens to him constant assiduous distillation of urine: because the place is not at all consolidated.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But administer its expulsion until it comes out: or use skills in its fracture with forceps, until you remove it by breaking it into pieces.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with thyme, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it up, and put on top of it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water: that the abscess may sit warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then place the feeble one on his back over his neck, and do not loosen the ligament until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When therefore you are loosening him, rub the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with diaphenic ointment, and basilicon ointment, until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however it happens in the wound that an abscess warm is added, and corroded, and similar things: as if blood congeals in the bladder, and is prevented from being urinated out: and this is known from the emission of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore insert your finger into the wound, and remove that blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, it provokes to the corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply it with whatever is suitable for healing until it becomes whole again.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it is necessary during the entire healing process to place bandages on both thighs and buttocks as a reason for applying the medications on the affected area.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is small and it is located in the vaginal opening and is stuck there and prevents the flow of urine, then cure it with what I mentioned before you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Often times you will avoid the need for an incision through this treatment, as I have already proven it to be effective.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And it is, that you take the Perforator from iron, which has this form, a triangular-shaped tip, sharp, fixed on wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and tie it with the reed under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the perforating iron into the reed with ease until the Perforator reaches the stone: and turn the Perforator by hand in the stone gradually, and try to make a hole through it until you make it penetrate from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	For the urine is immediately discharged.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outer part of the vagina.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it is broken up and exits with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from being done: then tie a thread under the stone and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then cut on the stone in the vagina between the two threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then remove it.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Afterwards, dissolve the ligament, and cleanse the congealed blood that forms in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	It is not necessary to use a thread under the stone, unless it does not return to the foreskin: and another thread above, unless when the thread below is dissolved after the stone's emergence, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound: and for this reason it is necessary for you to raise the skin above when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its original place and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	¶ On the Extraction of Stones in Women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stones are not commonly formed in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	If however it does occur to some of them, then the cure is difficult, and it is forbidden due to many reasons.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of these is: that she may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who conceals herself from the doctor when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman well-skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: therefore it requires deep incision, and there is fear.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If however necessity provokes to that, then it is necessary for you to take the woman to a doctor who is well-skilled: and she is not easily found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	But if you lack her, then seek a chaste, clever, and present female midwife well-skilled in the matter of women, or a woman who takes part in this art: make her present, and especially to her, that she does all that you order her from your investigation on the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	Firstly, it is necessary that he look to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is required that he insert his finger into her anus, and search for a stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If therefore he finds it, he should cover it with his finger, and then command the midwife to insert her finger into the weak vagina, and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder, and pressing it with good pressure.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If therefore he finds the stone, then it is required that he gradually move it from the bladder opening to the lower parts with great skill, until he reaches it with the stone at the root of the thigh.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should cover it over the bladder at the middle of the vagina, from whatever part it is prepared and feels the stone in that part: and his finger should not be moved away from the stone, covering it: and let the incision be small in the first place.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert the ray over that incision.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If therefore he feels the stone, then he should add to the incision in proportion to the amount that the stone is exiting from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And know that there are many kinds of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For from these there is a small one, and a large one, a smooth one and a rough one, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Know therefore its species, so that it may be signified to you by this above what you wish.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If therefore it convinces you with blood, then add in the place of zege ground, and hold it for an hour, until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone exits: and make sure that you prepare with yourself from the tools that I said in the extraction of the stone in men, so that you may help through them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If you are convinced that the cause of the bleeding is the expulsion of blood from an artery which has been cut, then place powder on the wound and bind it with a clean bandage, without moving it, and do not remove the stone, but leave it in place.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When, however, the sharpness of the blood is subdued after days, and the wound becomes putrid, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	¶ On cutting for hernia aquosa.
Caput LXII.	Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	Hydrocele is not present unless it is an accumulation of moisture in the sac under the skin of the testicle containing the epididymis, which is called the sac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own proper sac, which nature has prepared for itself in a part of the body, until it is thought to be something else, and that is another egg, and is the skin of the testicle between the sacs, which we have said: and this does not happen very often.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this hydrocele is indeed due to the weakness that happens to the testicles, therefore this material is poured out to them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	For indeed its color is declining to yellowness, or it is red with blood, or fecal, black, or is watery white, and that is the more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which it is known where the accumulation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the sac under the skin of the testicle which we have said, then the apostema is round to some length like the figure of an egg: and the testicle does not appear because the moisture contains it from every part.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	If there is moisture within its own cloth, then the abscess is round with a part of the egg, and because of this, the man considers it to be another egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	If there is moisture between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	Therefore, when you want to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the abscess with an square intruder, whose form precedes it.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	According to what goes out in the tread of the intruder, judge about that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When therefore we come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary for you to command the sick one, that he be bled if possible, and you see his body full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then let him lie on his back on a high bed, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then you sit on his left, and command the servant to sit on his right, who extends his rod to one of the two skin of the testicles, and to the part of the belly.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a wide spatula, and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle in length, until near the feather: and make the cut according to the rectitude of the line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white membrane encompassing: and scrape him and observe, or caution from this, that you dry him: and your scraping should be from the part which hangs with the egg more: and subtly scrutinize with the scraping according to the quantity which is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the full white membrane with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the cut with the hooks, and extend the white membrane to the upper parts, and do not touch the skin of the testicles encompassing: and cut the white membrane however it is possible for you to cut him, or with all of its, or frustatim, especially the thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	If you do not carefully examine it, there is no safety in the incision, so that water may not return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if you proceed with something from the outer part of its skin during your operation: then when you have completed the section, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as you would other wounds, until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if you find something corrupted from another discoloration, then it is necessary to bind wet dressings, which are the support, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the support, and remove it: then care for it with what we said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is gathered in two parts, then you will know that there are two branches: therefore cut off the other part according to what you did in the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is equal to you, that the operation be one, then do: then wipe off the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And insert in the incisions submerged wool in oil, or in rose-colored oil: and place another wool that you submerged in wine and oil, and spread it over two testicles, and belly: and place above double cloths, and are powders: and tie them above with a bandage, which has six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two cloths are taken, and they are soaked, and they are filled with powdered la na, according to this likeness: and the ends that press from the cotton, or wet wool: and they are gathered with a bandage in the loin braces: and one end takes above the anus up to the back, and the second takes to the part of the comb: and two ends on two thighs below, and two other ends on two inguina, and it is gathered all the bandage in the loin braces.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And at times, this ramex is artificially medicated with a cautery at the location of the incision with an iron: and it is, that you take a fine knife-cautery, and scrape with it the skin of the testicles: and it is ignited, according to what we have told: until when it detaches the white sheet containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letter is assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce through it with that sheet, and it is ignited, until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend that sheet with hooks, and scrape the flesh with a fine burning knife-cautery, and cut it according to what is possible for you, until you remove all of its roots.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And beware from the egg, lest it touch that fire.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is safer, and farther from bleeding, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if contradiction gives you in the hour of incision, or in the hour of cauterization, a hot abscess, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary for you to cure what contradiction gives you from that with the treatment that corresponds to it, according to what was previously mentioned.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if the patient is weak and timid, and does not wait for this operation because of its own horror: then administer perforation according to what I tell you: and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certified to you by that which we said about the meanings, that the ramex is watery: then it is necessary for you to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a narrow flat instrument: and place the perforation according to the length of the body, and it is an open wide, until all the water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place it on a soft spot, and tie it up, and let it run the remaining water: then care for it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if there is resistance to the outflow of water at the hour when it perforates itself: and this is not the case unless because the white cloth causes resistance in the wound opening, and prevents the exit of water: then you must insert a needle into the wound, or an instrument with which water is extracted from hydropicum, whose shape preceded: or add in the operation of the wound for a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns and gathers after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it therefore gathers, then it will be restored according to the same method, and it will pass its weak days.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	¶ On the care of fleshy tumors.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter 63.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	Know that in the cut above this tumor, there is often brought about by fear a harmful outcome in many positions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore it seems to me that its removal may be saved from that.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I remember the operation in it, and the appearance of abscesses.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are composed: and this is caused by many reasons, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Either from an excess of sharp, or sharp, which is poured out to the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the appearance of abscesses is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain found in it: and it is a heavy abscess.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it is caused by the knotting of the arteries, and their inflation: as has already been mentioned: or from the inflation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	What is caused by the inflation of the arteries can be known by the arrangement of the pus, when you press it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary to touch it entirely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which is caused by the inflation of the veins is not dispersed from it at all when pressed with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And now it is possible to make a cut of this kind and on the other flesh: and it is to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend it upwards and remove it with a white siphon: and free the suspension from the vessel, and tie the vessels: and cut the suspension after you have freed it from all parts of the parts of the wound.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If therefore the siphon is consolidated with those fleshy parts, then it is necessary to draw out the siphon and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is adhesion between something from the siphon, or in that which is between the vessels: then it is necessary to free the whole of that adhesion, and cut it with a round cut.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if there is the birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut all of it, and remove the siphon, as we said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in oil rose-scented, and wine: and then take care of it with the other care until it is healed.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	About the care of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter 64.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	There is an abscess uncovered in a certain inflation, similar to a boil, with the softening of the testicles: and it is difficult on weak movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	In the treatment of this ailment, fear is also involved due to the recollection of that which preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	However, we must say about the operation in that one according to how they did it first.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say therefore, that you should do so that the sick person sits on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push the scrotal supporter towards the lower parts.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with those which are near the maiden: and another servant should hold them and extend them with a strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut with a broad, flat, sharp transverse section across the direct way of the vases, until the vases are uncovered.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then remove all the scraps, as we told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix an awl in them where the thread is doubled, and tie it at the first place where the veins are: and tie it again at the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then cut them in the middle straight line according to the length of the body, and extract what gathers from the moist, corrupted feces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which you want to generate health, so that the vases which nourish one testicle fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not an evil through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the vein happens to all the vases, then it is necessary that they should be removed because of this testicle with the vases: so that it does not lose nourishment, on account of the incision, and it rots, or dries up, and it is not a benefit with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	§ On the care of the intestines.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The event of this injury is from a cut that occurred on the thigh, extended over the abdomen, in the part of the groin, from the inguinal region of the belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the thigh, or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis. Aut ex percussione. Aut saltu. Aut clamore. Aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two types occur from many causes. Or from impact. Or from a sudden jolt. Or from a loud noise. Or from heavy lifting, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the thigh's extension is that the intestines descend to one of the testicles.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal in length and depth: therefore, because the thigh compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from the thigh's cut is because it causes pain to occur suddenly at the beginning: and it is an abscess different, appearing under the nearby skin: and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the outer thigh.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it exits with the intestine fistula: and this is called an inguinal hernia, and a fistula: and sometimes it becomes with suppuration.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes feces run into the intestine, and are retained there: and it is with that harm to the weak: because it causes a dull pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of these kinds of illnesses with iron, there is fear: therefore it is necessary to avoid that case.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is, that you command the weak one, so that he may reduce the intestine with his own hand to the interior of its concavity, if it does not return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then apply pressure to his neck between your hands: and raise his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and dry the skin of the testicles entirely in length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then fix two hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them: and the section should be in the amount that is possible so that an egg can come out from it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape off the scrotum, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white scrotum is detached from all parts: then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, in that which is between the white scrotum, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the white scrotum, and complete with it the adhesion that is in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with your right hand to the interior of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the white scrotum upwards, with your left hand: and raise the egg with the scrotum to the part of the incision: and order the minister to extend the egg upwards: and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind the completed solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ask with your fingers, that there is nothing there from the unrolled intestine in the white scrotum hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	But if you find something from it: then push it down to the lower abdomen.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take a needle, in which there is a thick thread made of linen from ten threads: and insert it at the last scrotum, that is, the skin that follows the incision of the testicles: then cut the ends that project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make some of them on top of some with the figure that is in the shape of a cross: and tie with them the scrotum, which we said was under the skin of the testicles by a strong ligament, until it cannot send any from the vessels that nourish them to send something to them: so that no hot abscess comes from it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place the second ligature according to the first external ligature, about two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after these two ligatures, let out from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, an amount equal to the thickness of a finger: and cut the rest of it round and take out the egg.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which blood and pus flowed, as we mentioned in what was previously stated.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply the immersed bandage in oil, and place it on the wound: and apply the ligature which we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And sometimes the white sifach which we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, in fear of blood flow.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And let out the ligature until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then it should be rubbed with warm water: and place on it what we mentioned until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the wound with the rest of the treatment of wounds, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	¶ On the soft ramie.
Caput LXVI.	Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this soft ramie, I have not seen anyone daring to treat it with iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And the first said that it is done as we mentioned in the ramie which is with vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to apply ligatures on it after the incision from below with ease: then cut in the middle, and care for it finally with what opens it, until the ligatures fall off: and care for the wound, as we mentioned, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	¶ On the hernia that occurs in the groin.
Caput LXVII.	Chapter 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have mentioned, and the location is elevated and does not extend down to the testicles from the intestines: and if it does extend, it is only slightly and returns to its normal position at all hours. However, if this condition persists for an extended period of time, a new fissure forms in the scrotum, allowing the intestines to descend into the scrotum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this occurs due to the extension of the scrotum, which is located in the groin, as we have mentioned.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	This is because the scrotum is stretched: then it becomes softened, and the wound becomes inflamed, and it rises up.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its treatment is with a cautery, as previously mentioned in its description.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And sometimes it is treated with a knife, in this manner: and it is, that the sick person lies on their back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the wound of the inflamed rupture and elevated area, by cutting across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then bind the alsum (a type of adhesive) and what is under the skin, until when the scrotum is peeled off, which is under the skin that follows it.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the probe, and place it on the elevated location from the scrotum, and press it to the depth of the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then suck two elevated locations on the end of the probe from the scrotum, and connect them with a stitch one to another: then remove the end of the probe.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alsum at all, nor stretch anything, nor anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of the intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat that with the treatment of wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When therefore you cut the thread, clean it, and restore the wound, until it consolidates.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The scar contracts and does not add prominence to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And a cautery is better in this place, because it is closer to safety.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	On the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter 68.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because of which the flesh that is between them is softened and their appearance is defiled.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked about its cure, to make the sick man lie on his back, and let all the skin that is softened fall onto the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he should bring together two lips with a stitch: and if you wish, with three or four stitches on the first excess of the softened skin, and a strong stitch.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then cut between the stitches.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then care for the healing of the other wounds until he is healed, and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Chapter 69.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and for this reason it was allowed to me not to remember it in my book: and the remembrance of it is not necessary, except for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One of these is that it may be in the knowledge of a physician when he is asked about it: and that he may know its healing to him who has it happen to him.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals for our uses, because of our wool and milk, as cattle, horses, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by crushing.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or through an incision and a cut.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	However, in the method that is done by attrition, the way of operation is: we make the animal sit in hot water until the testicles are softened and soothed, and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they dissolve and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	However, in castration by incision and cut, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspensorium, and cut over every part with one cut, until when the two eggs proceed: then cut them after you have peeled each one, and do not leave on them any of the sifaket except the fine sifac on the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something in the testicles, therefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	¶ On the care of Hermaphrodite's two methods.
Caput LXX.	Head 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodites are from men according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	One of them is because it appears in him that follows the space, or on the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva, in which are hairs: and sometimes urine runs from that which is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	In women, however, there is one species, and it is a woman's vulva on the breasts like small male testicles projecting to the outside: of which one is like the man's priapus, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the care of three species, two from men and one from women, is: because it is necessary that you cut the added flesh until the impression of them disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of the rest of the wounds with the same treatment.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second species of men, from which urine exits through the skin of the testicles, there is no operation and no treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the incision of the tenting, and the prominent flesh in the vulvas of women.
Caput LXXI.	Chapter 71.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps the tentigo is added to the natural thing until it becomes disfigured and unsightly: and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it expands like in men, and reaches even to copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you must hold the excess of the tentigo with your hand or with a comb, and cut it: and do not complete the incision, especially at the deep root: so that blood does not flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself with the same treatment until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, the flesh that is born, is the flesh that is born in the maternal opening, until it fills it: and perhaps it exits to the exterior according to the similarity of a tail: and because of this, some call the sickness caudated.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore you must cut it as you would cut the tentigo, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	Regarding the care of the alratica, which is the vulva of a woman not pierced.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	The alratica is that it is the vulva of a woman not pierced, or that there is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	The accidental one is from the sickness that preceded it: and this is made either by flesh added naturally, or by thin silk, or by thick wool: and it is made in the deep maternal opening, or on its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part: and it prevents copulation and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And knowledge of that is gained through the observation of a midwife, if the swelling appears to be near.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not appearing, then search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	But if the swelling is from a thin sponge and is near two lips: then hurry, and tear it open.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And place cotton on the two lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your two fingers simultaneously, and the woman should be on her back with her legs spread apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength, until the thin sponge is torn and the swelling is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of cloth and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman cover it every day, so that it does not become hardened by another substance.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	But if the sponge is thick, foul-smelling: then it must be separated from the thin branch of a myrtle leaf.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	But if the swelling is from a piece of flesh born: then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be medicines with you that stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and a lump of frankincense mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a wide lead tube, so that the wound does not become hardened quickly, hold it for several days: and then administer linen from dry cloth, and then heal the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And sometimes the birth of flesh from other animals: therefore it must be cut according to this method: until there is no abscess or cancerous abscess, for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, does not make any contradiction with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids, Atrehelil and Botor, red in the vaginas of women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are the opening of the veins being dilated, until much blood flows from them continuously.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	Therefore, when hemorrhoids are treated, they become Atrehelil: and I have already spoken about their division and signs in my previous work, and now I will say what kinds of them can be cured and what cannot.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and do not appear to sense, then there is no cure with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are in the opening of the womb above which sensation falls, are those that can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	Therefore, it is necessary to insert the woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Atrehelil with forceps, or with rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then powder over them at the flow of blood from one powder of cut pieces without biting: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and thistle, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then press her feet against the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then lay her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, and the bark of grapevines, and henbane, and similar things.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore blood is removed with it, it is good: and if not, make feathers and sponges stick to her back without incision.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathite, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of the leaves of the alaulat tree, that is, the wild vine, with sea water, and make it stick to the wound.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the abscess has settled, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth indeed is red like the heads of the alhaise, and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore you must cut off what appears from it, as I said in the thistle evenly: and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	¶ On the perforation of the fetus that happens in the womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXII
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and carbuncle, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, aestiomemus, and fistulae, and hemorrhoids, and ragadiae, and thistles, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I indeed have already spoken of all these afflictions and their kinds, and their signs, and their cures in the division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about hot abscess that happens in the womb when it is from the abscesses that collect pus, and you want to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you must consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with its blow, and flame, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on it sensation, then do not rush with its opening: and care for it with it that helps over maturation, until when quietness of the accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then you should make the woman sit on a seat that washes two seats, and she should lean back, or be placed on her back, and gather her feet to the lower part of her belly: and let her hips be spread, and place her arms under her thighs, and bind each side with a suitable band.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the right side, and hold the instrument that opens the maternal opening.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes in those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And when you want to administer this instrument, you should form with a radio deep in the woman's womb: so that it is not what enters from the instrument more than deep in the womb, and wounds the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is greater than deep in the womb, then you should place pledgets on the roof of deep in the womb: so that the entrance of the instrument entirely into deep in the womb is prevented: and you should place a wheel, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and you should hold the instrument, and you should turn the minister wheel, until deep in the womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by hand, and is gentle and soft: then you should set it aside with a flat spatula near its head.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When therefore the pus is evacuated, then you should place a piece of lint soaked in rose oil: or oil green, in which there is some hemostatic: and place the lint, and extract the cutting in deep in the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And place outside on the womb, and on a clean needle soaked in water, in which there are some tannins.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it should be treated after two days with an ointment that is suitable for it, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the mother is washed and the wound, so that it is dressed with water and honey: then with water in which boiled is the root of the lily or long-leaved aristolochia, then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	If the wound is hidden inside the matrix, then it is necessary to be prohibited from its healing with iron, indeed to heal it with what we said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Of the teaching of obstetrics, how the fetuses are healed who have exited in a form not natural.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetrician to know in the first place the form of natural birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	For this is the sign of it that when you see a woman being pressed down to her lower parts, and desires to smell the air, and is relieved above her which is over her from birth, and hastens the exit of the fetus: then know that this birth is according to the form of nature, and its exit is on its head, and the placenta with it: or suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When therefore you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be pressed, so that the fetus may descend quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has descended on its head, it has descended with the placenta, and is cleansed of those superfluities by good cleaning.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But he who is other than this birth, is unnatural, undeserving.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when sometimes the fetus exits above its feet, and exits the body before its head, and its body, and one of its hands, or one of its feet: or exits its head and one of its hands: or exits its belly: and perhaps it turns over on its neck, and similar from undeserving figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the midwife to be wise and clever in all these matters, and to beware of error and deception: and I am showing every figure from them, and what kind of nature is in it, and how it is signified by it, and stands above it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the child exits its head with its own natural exit, and becomes violent upon the woman, and difficult birth becomes for her, and you see that its strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a seat, or let women hold her: and vapor of wormwood with fenugreek decoction, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife should insert between her fingers a small spatula, and apply it with it a second instrument, and cover it with her nail, until what is in it from moisture: and press the woman's belly, until the child descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	But if it does not descend, then it is necessary to enema the woman from fenugreek mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then tell her after the enema to sneeze: and make her sneeze with the condiment, and hold her nose and her nostril at once.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	The child will exit immediately.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	But if two hands of the child come out first, then you should gradually reduce them with a hook.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	But if it does not obey at the entrance, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up: then shake the seat on the ground: and the woman should be held, so that she does not fall with the shaking.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If therefore the hands do not come out, and the child dies: then cut them, and remove the remaining fetus: and tie its hand with cloth, and remove it with equality: for it will exit.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo is upon its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus exits upon its feet, then it is necessary to push it upwards: afterwards, he should gradually turn the fetus: then, he should balance it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then, he should take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When therefore they exit up to the hips, then command him, that he be compressed, and make her sneeze with a wet cloth: it will exit, if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not exit with what we have said, then reduce the fetus gradually, until you place him according to the natural form.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will exit then with an easy exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is prevented with all that we have said: then take from the mucilage of the aloe, and oil of sisamino, and melted gum: and strike all in a mortar with good percussion: afterwards, a line with it the woman's umbilical cord, and below the belly of her.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water, until she has a hiccup.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When therefore you see that the lower parts of her are already heated, then make for her a fomentation from myrrh: and cover him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When therefore she holds the fomentation for one hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her sneeze: and squeeze his mouth and nose: and press the lower part of the belly with gentle compression.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fetus will exit immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	The exit of the fetus upon its knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it exits according to this form, then he should gradually insert his hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman should lie on her back, with her feet hanging down, and she should fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then gradually press on her abdomen.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then remove what is under her feet from the pillows until it is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them with great force.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then gradually press on what is above the hypochondria until the fetus rises to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert her hand and gradually equalize the fetus until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hangs laterally from her hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	Her hand is supported in the reduction.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot reduce it, then lift her up and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If indeed she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and shake her legs with great force.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment that you prepared from mucilages.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If she accepts it in labor, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then strive in the reduction of her hand and equalize the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and tell her to compress herself until it comes out.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus is on its neck, with its hands spread out, and its face is towards the back of its mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	The midwife should hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place on its vulva what we mentioned from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then instruct him to be gradually moved.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When therefore you have done that, then make him sit on a seat, and instruct him to lean towards the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	Then instruct him to be compressed: and make him sneeze with the conditioned [medicine].
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The outcome of the prepared [foetus] is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the maternal opening according to this manner with the secundine, then cut the secundine with your nail, until it is emptied of moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If therefore it is suspended above the face of the foetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be retained, and die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the foetus to the insides, until you place it according to what is necessary: and instruct the woman to compress herself several times: for he will exit lightly with the outcome.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The outcome of twins, or of many foetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	Know that twins are often born: and sometimes they are born three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is foreign, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five indeed is a thing extraordinary, and does not live completely: and it contains them, although they multiply, one secundine: and they are separated by the sac, distinguishing between them tied in the navel of each of theirs.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they exit as if one foetus exits naturally and easily, and they exit with the praiseworthy outcome, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If however some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach that which we said from the unnatural figures, then care for them as we have said: and let it be for the subtle midwife, and she should make what she does with facility and slowness, and she should shape it according to every figure with that which is prepared for her by the leading [force] to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Rememoration of what is formed in the womb from embryos and miscarry.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb: and it has been verified to me that a woman miscarried seven, and another fifteen, all of them formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	Which was done by the measurement of the glorious wise one.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, all of this must be in the knowledge of the obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps he will come to her like that one: therefore, let him put against him what is necessary
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Rememoration of the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you care for a dead fetus with that which I said in the division of medication, and it does not exit, and you must use an operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If therefore the woman is of sound virtue, and is not with any of those accidents from which danger is feared for her: then it must be that the woman lies on the bed, on her back, and her head is inclined downwards, and her legs are raised: and the assistant holds her from two parts, or she is tied to the bed, so that her body is not drawn out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with warm oils mixed with a lot of mucilage, and of fenugreek, and of the seed of linseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages: then she should insert it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then let her seek with her the place where she can hook the nails from the fetus, and the suitable places to that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, if the fetus is prepared to descend upon its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or on its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its shoulder blades, or in nearby ribs, and under its armpits.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	But if the descent is upon its feet: then in the shinbone, and in its middle ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary that he holds the hook with his right hand: and place the curve of it in what is between the fingers of his left hand: and insert it with his left hand with facility, and fix the hook in one of those places which we mentioned, until he arrives at the empty place.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he should fix another hook, or a third if necessary, on its opposite side, so that the contraction is equal, and does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then the extension should be made equally, and not be extension only in a straight line, but move to all parts, so that his exit is facilitated: just as it is done with the tooth when it is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary in that which is between them, that the extension be softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If a part of it is held back from that: then it is necessary for the midwife to put some fingers with oil on them, and insert them from one side, so that she rolls it with what is being held back.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If therefore a part of the fetus comes out, then they should change the hooks to another place which is higher: do this until the whole fetus comes out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If therefore the hand comes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it, because of its tightness: then it is necessary for a cloth to be rolled over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then take it out until when it comes out whole, cut it at the joint of the foot, or at the elbow: and so it is necessary to do in the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the fetus's head is large, or if there is a constriction at the outlet, or if there is water accumulated in its head: then it is necessary to insert the Spatula-like spiny instrument between the fingers, and strike with it against the head, and remove the water; or to break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is naturally of large head: then it is necessary to separate the alengengematu: or to extract it with the misdach, as we said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then extract the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork: then it is struck, until the moisture that is in the chest flows out.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	If it does not constrict, nor obey the outlet: then cut the head in small pieces, as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If there is an abscess below the belly, or if there is dropsy in it: then it is necessary to pierce it, until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	If indeed the fetus is above its feet: then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mother's bones is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	If it is constricted at the belly, or the chest: then it is necessary to extract it with the cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and strike the belly, or the chest, until what is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	If the other limbs are removed, and the head returns: then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Therefore, if the mother's bones are open: then she should insert her hand into the depth of the mother's bones, and seek with it the head, and draw it out with her fingers until the mother's bones: then she should insert a hook, or two hooks, into it, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	If the mother's mouth is closed due to an abscess that has occurred to her, then it is not necessary for her to be forced upon it, but rather it is necessary at that time to administer a moist effusion, a thick one: and apply ointments, and let her sit in waters that will soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to do so: then what we said about the living fetus will be administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do that, then it is cut into pieces and removed.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary not to let anything remain inside the secondina at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then what we said about hot abscesses that occur in the mothers will be administered.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If bleeding occurs, then it should go down into stop-bleeding waters, and the rest of the cure will be administered.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And indeed I have seen a woman whose belly had a dead fetus: then she became pregnant over it with another, afterwards the other fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Therefore it happened to her after a long time that an abscess occurred in her navel, and it swelled up until it was open: and she began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	Therefore I was called for her cure, and I treated her for a long time: and the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Therefore I placed on it some strong attracting ointments: and the bone came out of the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then some days passed by her, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	Therefore I was amazed from there, since in the belly there is no bone.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	Therefore I thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I have examined the wound, and extracted many bones, with the woman being in her better conditions: and she has now lived for a long time in this manner, and she is now discharging some pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not apply this foreign matter here, unless there is knowledge and assistance from the skill and craft of the physician artist with his hand for the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	¶ On the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here below is the form of the Strictorium, by which the rib bones are equalized, with two pulleys evenly placed on the two ends of two wooden rods.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this pulley should be more delicate than the Strictorium: and it is made from either ebony or from smooth wood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the width of each wood is as if two fingers: and the edge of each of them is as if one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half: and in the middle of the two woods are two additions of the same type of wood, which have already been fixed in both, whose length is a palm and a half or more, and the width of each of them is as if two fingers, or more.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mother's ribs, so that it opens with them when you turn the two pulleys.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the pulley that opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to it, but more delicate and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made from ebony or smooth wood, according to the similarity of a pair of tongs.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see above: and the length of each addition is as if a palm: and the width of each of them is as if two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	When you want to open the mother's womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, with her feet hanging down, opening what is between her legs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions connected into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the mother's womb, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of another tilt than they said of the ancients, namely the form of Impelling which impels the fetus.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almisdac, by which the large head is crushed: and it resembles forceps, which have teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it becomes a tongue, like forceps according to this form, as you see, which have teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almisdac by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of forceps which have teeth like a saw, by which the fetus's head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatumilis which has two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatumilium and also pullers.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all exercised, and the more multiplied their species, and they are prepared by the craftsman, is faster to their operation, and higher among men, because of their quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore do not despise from them an instrument, that it is prepared by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	Their necessity is indeed inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	On the Extraction of a Second Tooth.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter 78.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second tooth is retained during childbirth, then it is necessary to instruct the weak one to hold their breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make her sneeze with a wet cloth: and press your hand on her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If it comes out this way, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a pot, and pierce the lid with a hole: and put in it opening drugs for the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, and aneth, and chamomile, and seseli, and cassia wood, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and mix them with water, and put them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a reed bundle on the hole of the lid of the pot, and the other end in the mother's mouth: and hold it until the steam reaches the hollow of the mother.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second tooth will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment, and does not come out: then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sisamin oil, or a thick decoction of althea.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should insert it into the vulva, and seek for the second tooth with it.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When therefore she finds it, then she should take it, and stretch it slowly.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is attached deep in the mother's womb, then she should insert her hand, as we said, until when she finds the second tooth, and takes it out slowly according to straightness, so that the mother does not fall during strong attraction: indeed it is necessary, that it be changed with ease to the right and left sides: then add in the amount of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	It dies then and is preserved, and avoids sticking.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mother's mouth is closed, as we have already mentioned: treat it with nasal irrigation and with the herbal remedy from the bowl.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If however it does not come out with all that we have mentioned, then be careful not to exhaust it with repeated extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	However, it is necessary that what comes out from the mother's mouth should be tied to the woman's groin.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then cleanse it with the Tetra Pharmakon ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For indeed it will rot it after days, and dissolve, and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	However, when it rots, the bad smell is removed from the stomach and head, and harms that weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore it is necessary that appropriate fumigations should be administered to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	However, some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument by which the woman is fumigated during retention of Secundine and menstrual blood.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let a hollow instrument like a pipe or a jar be made from clay: and place its wide end over the fire: and the fumigation should be placed on the branches: hold it until that fumigation is consumed: and repeat another.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	On the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	Chapter 79.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many children are born, and their anuses are not perforated, which he has already covered with soft shavings.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore it is necessary that the midwife should pierce it with her finger: and if not, she should pierce it with a sharp spatula: and beware of the hand, lest it touch it.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place a wool soaked in wine and oil on top of it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	But if you fear that it will swell, then place a lead tube with a hole in the opening for many days, and remove it when the boy wants to go out.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And now swelling of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of the wound or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary to cut away that consolidation, then care for it with what we said about the cure and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	¶ On the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas that occur in the lower part are Nodosities and Swelling which occur near the anus, deforming: or in the space of one part: and it is a fistula, or more.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that nodosity is opened, water flows out from it, or thin pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes they are from these penetrating fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are known by what comes out from defecation, and softness, when an invalid is used for defecation: and perhaps it comes out from those worms.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are from these fistulas when they are in the space penetrating up to the bladder, and up to the vagina.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are from these penetrating up to the junction of the hip, and up to the tailbone.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that however by which it is known that the penetrating fistula reaches to the anus, even from the non-penetrating one, is that you insert your finger into the anus: and you insert a thin probe into the fistula from air, or iron: when there is no twisting.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is twisting in it, then insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair needle from the horses' hair into it, until you feel the probe, or the needle in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it entirely, and nothing protrudes from the opening due to excretion, nor is there wind or worms as I said, then you know that it is not punctured: therefore hasten to treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula is punctured up to the bladder or the urethra, then its signification is the exit of urine from it, and its prevention from this so that the place can consolidate with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	But if it is punctured up to the hip joint or the hip bone: then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no twisting in it up to the bone: and the discovery of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always escapes from it: and that medication does not hold in it, nor consolidates with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these fistulas that penetrate, there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is a labor and vanity to him, from foolish doctors, on which it is based.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	But in that which is not punctured, and is not ancient, there is hope of healing with a splint: according to what I tell you, and I have already tested: and it is, that the sick person lie under your hands on his back: and raise his legs up above his hips, and his hips be inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then he will insert the thin lead probe, or of air, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the probe reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if the sick person feels it around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If you feel that the prick has already penetrated itself through your finger, apart from what you felt between your finger and it, or flesh: then you must certainly know that it is a prick, and therefore do not labor in it, since there is no cure for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	But they said that flesh is healed in some men, and from the medication by which it is hoped for healing, it is, to apply a thin hot cauterizing iron according to the size of the Fistula, as has been mentioned before, and to insert the burning one into the Fistula, until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that twice or three times, until you know that all the added flesh has been burned, which are like the filtered feathers that are similar to the quill of a bird's wing.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then care for that with rolled linens in butter, until those burned flesh comes out: then care for that with ointments generating and consolidating flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If therefore it is healed, good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be healed with other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out and does not reach to your finger which is in the anus, and is between it and the thick, slimy skin from flesh or flesh: and you see the Fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the Fistula, and you go drying with the tent which is in the Fistula, until the drying reaches where the end of the tent comes out, and the tent is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh which are similar to the quill of a bird's wing, so that nothing remains from them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, the blood adheres to you and dissolves between you and the operation, so that you separate those flesh: then it is better and faster to cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	Because the cauterizer with fire gathers good conditions, it adds burns of those flesh, and separation of blood, and drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then care for it with unfolded bandages in butter, or crushed bread, until the place emits pus, and those burnt flesh come out into pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then care for the wound then with consolidating ointments, generating hard flesh: and they are medicines in which there is stipticness and drying.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when it is restored, then already it is healed: and do not fear repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	If however the fistula has already reached to the depth of the anus, and is stretched from the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and inquire with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If therefore you feel a touch, and between you, and it is a linen from sifac, or flesh, and is near penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is administered in it one of three ways: either to cauterize it, as we said: or to separate it, until you reach the depth of it, so that it is possible for you to insert bandage, and healing from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cut, so that you do not cut the muscle containing the anus, and it happens that the weak exit of excretion without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for it with what we said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be healed: or extend the same bandage, and cleanse it after you have dried it nearly up to near the anus, as we have said, or with another sharp-ended instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those filtered fleshy parts which are in the incision, as far as you can with thorough scrubbing.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then attempt the healing of the wound entirely with the incision, and at the upper opening where it is solidified: and there remains an open fistula in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter on the weak one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes the fistula will follow in this manner: and it is, when you insert the probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and margin of the anus: then take the probe with sharp-ended extremities, which is like a needle made of aleskef, that is, prepared leather, in this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert it into it a wrapped thread from five threads, and about it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the probe with thread into the fistula, until it reaches its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If therefore it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus near, then draw out the thread from that opening: so that you insert your finger into the anus, and draw out the end of the thread, and gather both extremities together: and tie both, and let it go on one day, or two days: and as much as the thread falls on the flesh, tie it well, until those fleshy parts which are between the two ends of the thread fall off: then care for the wound, until it is solidified, and healed.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way is prepared for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For it is not necessary for you to do this because of the shoulder, so that you do not cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then treat her as we said, until she is healed.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The shape of the Spatula's spinous process, in which the fistula is found, has a very sharp curvature, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	On the stitching of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incisions: and the treatment of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	For indeed they are inside the anus, like coal or plums: or rather they are like the grains of wheat.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small and large ones: and blood flows from them always, and it is one, and they are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus, are for the most part few in moisture, from which yellowish water flows, or little blood flows constantly: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of those that are inside the anus is, that you order the sick person to sit on a stool: and it is expressed, until the anus opens, and the fissures appear to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also hang them with hooks: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they are not held in them with hooks, because of their moisture and softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a rough cloth made of double woolen fabric, and extract them with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then, make an incision on them and apply hot powder on top of the incision some powders, so that they remain in place as a cauterizing agent.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what was mentioned in the previous chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with the remaining cure until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the patient does not obey the call to defecate, then apply a small amount of clyster in a clyster containing a small amount of bitter herbs, so that it cleans out what is in the anus and obeys the call to defecate quickly when the patient excretes.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if the thorns are outside the anus, then the matter is light and easy: and it is to take them with your nail, or take them with a spoon, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then care for them with what we mentioned, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if one dislikes the incision with a knife, then it is necessary for the administrator to suture them according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take an untwisted thread, and insert it into the needle.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then take out the thorns to the top, and make it penetrate with the needle from the root on the other side: and untwist the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and they should be wide apart: and tie the thorns with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie the thread, and take out the needle.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the thorns, and take out one from them: and do not let it run out of it to prevent excessive bleeding.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or carron oil on the anus and place it on the anus: and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then take it out when it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When, therefore, the hernias fall, take care of them with ointments and other means of healing until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	¶ On the Care of Wounds.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	For often, due to the dryness of dung and the constriction of nature, many wounds occur.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When, therefore, they are dry and do not respond to medicine: then it is necessary to scrape them with the spatula of Spatam, or with your ointment, until they become moist, and remove the upper skin that prevents their consolidation.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then care for them until they consolidate as they should.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	But if they do not consolidate: then repeat them with a stronger blade than the first, until they bleed much, and then peel them, and care for them until they are healed.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	¶ On the Care of Turned-Over Bones, and Not Turned-Over; and Hernias of Scorpions, and Ants.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	You should know that an Almirmar is not other than a round knot similar to the head of a nail: and it forms throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet, and fingers: and pain occurs from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore it is necessary to follow what is around the head of the nail, and hold it with forceps, or with a hook, and remove it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then care for that: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what preceded in its chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From the hernias that are dry, one is a small elevation, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And often they occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	And its care is, that you extend the hernias, and cut it: or string it with a silk thread: or with hair, until it falls.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously mentioned with fire or with sharp medicine: and now the ingrown hairs will be eradicated, and not with the instrument that I say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	The ant is also a small bumpy, porous, and rough surface on the body, leaning into a very deep valley: and when it finds cold, it feels like an ant bite in it, and it happens throughout the body: and it does the most harm to the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is that you take a cannula from the feather of a goose, or the feather of a strong-winged bird: and place the cannula on the ant, until it contains a circle of the cannula from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then turn your hand with the cannula until it separates what is in the circumference of the ant: and place it in the deep flesh, and remove the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do it with the cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let the upper cannula be pulling the dull uncovered, so that it is relieved from the apprehension of its height and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish, cauterize the ant according to what was previously mentioned in the cauterization of ingrown hairs in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	§ On the forms of instruments that are administered to cleansing in the ailments of the anus, and the solution of the belly, and the colon.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	Sometimes cleansing is made of silver, or of gold-plated, or of bronze, or of hammered.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made of these instruments small and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	That which is administered for the treatment of small children should be of a small quantity: and those whose anuses are weak or painful, so also their stools.
Clistere magnum.	A large stool.
Cistere paruum.	A small stool.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The cannula of his, that is, the upper part in which the uterus is tied, should be large according to this manner: and there should be a distinction for it so that the uterus is tied as you see, and the lower part which enters into the anus, should be deaf, that is, not open, soft, rather drawing towards subtlety: and in one of its sides there should be two holes, and in the other side there should be one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little less, and the uterus in which the medicines are placed from the animal's bladder: or from the small paper which is according to the form of the asafetida root, whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And it should be pierced through the holes as it unfolds, and there should be a space which is the thickness of a finger between each hole.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then introduce into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is from ten threads, or about that, and gather with it a jug like the asafetida.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When therefore it is placed in that uterus, it should be tied at the head of the stool with a strong constriction between two distinctions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then draw up the stool with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle of these utensils and holes drawn here.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	But the quality of drawing up the stool with it is: that you fill the jug or bladder from the medicine which is heated according to the quantity of the weak tolerance: and beware that it is not very hot, or very cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the sick person should lie face downwards on their back, and raise their legs upwards: and place a cloth or linen underneath them.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then apply oil, or a yellow ointment, or mustard plaster, or something similar, to the extremities of the Clisteris.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the attendant should take a jug with both hands and squeeze it forcefully until all the contents of the Clisteris are emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the Clisteris and raise the sick person's legs against the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine makes him want to go to the bathroom, then hold onto it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more likely to be effective.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if the Clisteris is used during the illness of diarrhea, and he wants to go quickly: then repeat the Clisteris until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	But if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then the Clisteris should be fine, very mild, and made from the same Clisteris that children are treated with.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this is the form of a fine Clisteris on top of which there is tight skin.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	§ On the Treatment of Head Wounds without Breaking Bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter 82.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was convenient for this book, and now I will say here the treatment of them with hand, and with medicines according to the complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say therefore that wounds are diversified according to how they become wounds, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	The wounds that are made frequently are like the throw of a stone; they are either from the cutting of a sword or knife, or by striking with a lance, a stick, or an arrow, and similarly from many other things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, the wounds that are made according to the parts of the body are like a wound that falls on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or back, and similarly from other limbs.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling the cures for some wounds, so that I may set forth a reason and rule for all other wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds, because the memory of compound ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of bone, consider whether it is from the throw of a stone or similar things, and if it has already broken the skin only: and it is a large wound, and you fear for the bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and let blood from the cephalic vein immediately: and do not delay in doing so: and remove from him according to the amount of its power: if there is nothing preventing bleeding from phlebotomy, especially if it is little blood that flows out of the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the bleeding be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the weak one beware of overfilling himself, and wine, and coarse foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	But if something prevents him from having a diet, then he should be reduced in his food, and not approach meat, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And put on the wound if it happens to him an abscess hot, cotton infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are secure from the hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the powder that I will tell you about shortly: and if it has already changed the air, then place on it certain ointments until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	But if the wound is large, or is from a sword cut, and similar: and if the lips of it do not come together with gauze, then stitch it together according to what I will tell you about wounds of the belly regarding their stitches.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	But if the wound has already been removed from the bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it except in a small sling: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore hard flesh to the place of skin, and order the sick person to be fed on foods in which there is bulk, such as heads and cooked wheat, until it is like a porridge: and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not stick to bone: then cut off the whole putrefied part, and throw it away: then care for that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there are these wounds an artery, or a vein from which the blood flows: and it is not cut through by medicines, then examine the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	Then if you find it not cut, then secure it with a ligature, or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if necessity provokes when it does not bring what we said: then cauterize it, until the blood is cut off.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small, simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that powder is placed on them this powder: because it consolidates them before it changes them from the air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of making a powder for flesh wounds is as follows:
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe for treating a wound with the juice of garlic, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of unburnt chalk: Grind all the ingredients thoroughly and sift them. Apply this mixture to the wound and bind it tightly with a bandage until it adheres well and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind the wound from above with bandages and leave it undisturbed until it heals, without removing the bandage prematurely to prevent reopening of the wound.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this remedy will not be removed until the wound is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And sometimes chalk alone can perform the same function in many large wounds when it is applied and bound, especially when the wound is fresh and still bleeding, as air has not yet altered it.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	If the wound has already been altered by air, especially in the summer season, then this powder is not suitable for use: therefore, treat it with the remedy mentioned earlier and apply some digestive ointments or bandages made of barley flour mixed with water and honey until the pus is expelled.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then continue treating it with the remaining remedies until it heals completely.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If indeed a small fragment of bone is embedded in the wound, then remove it with a pair of forceps: and I will now describe the treatment for broken bones in the following section.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	¶ On Wounds of the Head
Caput LXXXV.	Head LXXXV
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If a wound occurs on the head, there is no difference in treatment between a simple wound and a more complex one.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If the nerve or artery has already been cut, there is no cure for it except with strong hemostatic agents such as zinc, zegi, and similar substances.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they harm the eyes and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not place anything very cold on the wound at all, for the substance of the nerves is cold and its continuity is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that which heals be taken from medicines that are mild, such as chalk soaked in sweet water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil and turpentine, when it is washed even with sweet water; and the remaining mineral stones, in this manner, and wet ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	But if the wound is large, then administer a suture: or cut the lips of it with cotton.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	But if the wound is deep, or it occurs in it a sinus in the lower part of it, in which already pus has accumulated, then perforate it in a more depressed place in it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	But if the artery has already been cut in the wound and blood flowed from it: then separate, or dry it, and ligate it: or cauterize it, if necessity requires this.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	But if the spinal cord of the neck has already occurred, or all of it, and the larynxes have been saved: then gather the lips of the skin with a suture on a tube of the neck, and do not touch the neck, but rather even it, and reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then bind it with a proper binding, and leave it for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointments in which there is styptic and drying, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then seek it: then if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them, or what you can from them: and that which is not prepared, leave it, until the wound rots, and its discharge separates and heals.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then apply powder on top of the powder I mentioned.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	But if it appears that there is a bone in the wound and a fistula forms, then treat it along with the one I mentioned in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Chapter on Wounds in Forceps.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter 86.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a puncture from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If therefore gas escapes from the wound when it is difficult for the patient to breathe from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	But if it is not deep and is recent with its own blood, then do not apply powder to it from the first hour, nor bind it up, so that the blood does not remain in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient: but apply an attractive ointment to it and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if indeed the ointment is not present to you, then place a piece of old cloth in the wound opening, so that it sucks out what escapes from it due to moisture: and make the patient sleep over the wound, so that what collects in it may pass.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if indeed three days or more have already passed since the wound, and no spasm has occurred to the patient, nor a bad trembling of the heart, nor tightness in breathing, and you see other dispositions of it are good: then know that the wound is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore treat it and with liniments, and with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	But if indeed the healing of it is excused, and it always opens, then know that it has already become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, treat it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest or back: then treat it with what preceded from stitching, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and it has cut from there fragments: then inquire about the wound, and hasten to remove those fragments, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound rots, for it is relieved by their extraction.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But of the remaining wounds that have occurred in other members, the judgment in their treatment is the same as what we said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their exit.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture that occurs in the belly is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	From a great one, sometimes the intestine exits, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Therefore, their introduction is, and their stitching, more violent and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And the small rupture also becomes difficult from another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it follows that their reduction is difficult, if you do not hasten to their introduction to their place immediately: because it swells, opens, and fills up: therefore, its entrance is difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	For this reason, the medium rupture becomes better: because with it, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You should know that the stitching of the belly is according to four modes.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures meet in the ventral suture, and in the suture of other bodily wounds; and two other sutures properly communicate with the remaining wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper with the ventral suture; and I tell you each one with explanation, and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I therefore say, because when a wound is small, and something escapes from it into the intestine, and it becomes difficult to reduce it: then that is for one of two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Either because of the smallness of the rupture, as we said: or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When therefore it is so, then it is necessary to heat it, so that you submerge the sponge, or wet cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or boil it in water with vinegar, and cumin, and clove, and embrocation with it the intestine, until the inflation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	Sometimes that wine in which there is astringency does it: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with the water in which it was boiled, or warm.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For through that it soothes the entrance of his stomach with a small amount.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	But if the return of his escape after this cure is excused, then find in small rupture, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when prepared, than section: and it is not forced to cut after necessity and lack of instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of his be curved, sharp, and another part not sharp, and the extremity subtle not with subtlety Spatumilis, but rather obtuse: and it is that which resembles a lancet, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When a wound becomes large and enters the intestine, it is necessary to reduce it back to its natural shape in its proper place, if possible, because this is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When indeed the rupture is large in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the person lie on their back and place their higher legs above their head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place their head and make their higher chest higher than their lower chest.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then place your attention and always consider this, that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And thus you should administer it in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	But in small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that a pious assistant is present between your hands who holds the rupture entirely with their hand: and gather their lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then remove from it to him who follows a suture, something after something: and this is the common method of suturing one at a time.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the rupture a quantity of a finger's width, that is, a doctor's: and fix the needle one on the other, with two ends of the skin, with two ends of the sinew that is under the skin from the insides, until you make it penetrate from another part, and now you have gathered two ends of the skin, and two ends of the sinew: and four rows are made.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with a double thread around the wound, several times from two parts at once, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together decently by aggregation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the thickness of the finger, and fix a needle in it: afterwards, straighten it with the thread, as you did with the needle first.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	Therefore do not cease to do this with that which you need from the couch, until you complete the constriction of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let the needles be of medium thinness between thickness and fineness: for a thin needle very quickly enters flesh: and thick ones are difficult to pierce skin: therefore it is necessary that they should be of medium thinness in thinness and thickness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it is not necessary, that the needle should be fixed in both extremities of the skin near, much: so that flesh does not quickly enter, and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and they do not extend even with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the needle, so that they do not wound the weak one while asleep: and put pullovers of cloth from all parts, which hold the ends of the needle: and let them go, until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of suture with the couches is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it is enough in their suture one needle, or two, or about those.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second suture is common, so that it gathers with the suture the ends of four: ends, two of skin, and ends two of silk in one vice, with the needle in which is the thread rolled up equally in thinness and thickness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then, when you have penetrated with the needle these four extremities, reduce the needle from the part from which you began, so that a thread soaked in oil may fall from the upper part of the wound: so that it may be a suture, just as they string together pieces of cloth. And place between every suture an amount of thickness equal to the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This suture, however, is known by men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this suture, I closed the wound that had occurred to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a tear larger than a palm: and it had exited from the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and there was a tear in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I therefore reduced it after it had stood the intestine of his outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound therefore became healed in the space that was about fifteen days: and I took care of him, and he was healed: and he lived after that for many years, returning to his former dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the physicians had judged that he would not be healed.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And it was a miracle that I did not take care of him with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in a place where ointment was not found, nor anything from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I therefore placed on the wound an old cloth twice a day, and I took care of his washing with honey water, until he was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	Two however species of suture proper I will say according to the narrative of the language.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is, so that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the outer to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and goes into the muscle going along the length and width of the whole body: let go the end of the suture in the side in which you inserted the needle, and make it to penetrate in the other extremity from the inner part to the outer in the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate thus in the same extreme part from the outer side to the inner: and leave off the extreme part which is in this side, and make the acum penetrate into the other extreme part from the inner side to the outer: and make it penetrate with your penetration as you make it penetrate in that extreme part of the mirach, which is in its part, until it penetrates into the whole of it.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also begin from this same side, and pull out that itself with its extreme part, which is from the sifac on another side and outside, and draw out the acum from the skin which it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then bring it back into that skin, and pull out that extreme part of the sifac, which is on another side, with this extreme part of the mirach: and draw it out from the skin which is on its part, and make one with the other, and make it one after the other, until you have pulled out all of it outside according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the last of this stitching is that you stitch with the stitches by which they stitch the skins: so that you stitch one extreme part of the skin on one side with the other, until you have completed it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	The second kind of proper stitching, which he said Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This his speech was told in order that you stitch it according to the likeness by which some physicians stitch them, so that they gather all part to its suitable corresponding part by nature: and they apply the extreme part of the sifac to its other extreme part, and the extreme part of the mirach to its other extreme part.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And that is done according as I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should make a groove in the tip of the mira near you from the outer side, and make it penetrate to the inner part within that soil, and release its two ends.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then turn the mira back, and make it penetrate from the outer side to the inner part within both ends.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them back, and also make them penetrate from the inner part to the outer side within both ends, in the two other ends of the mira which are on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is better than a common easy suture, and it is a suture preceded by remembrance.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	Therefore, this is also the word of Galen.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the belly should be corrected with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	Which is, that you insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who equalize the hides.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly: then its suture is more difficult than the other parts of the belly.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the medication of wounds, however, is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	Which is, because when you seek the recent wound with its own blood before it changes due to air: and you reduce the intestine, and its own, and make it suitable for itself: then place it on powder of flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	But if the air has already changed the wound: then place on it some ointments which are present with you until they make pus: and fall off the threads, and strengthen them again, and the mira.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that wound as you would with the treatment of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have the necessary medicines at hand, then immediately place on it an old piece of cloth that has been used before, and change it twice a day as I taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other treatment in many situations when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you fear that the wound will communicate to the main members in a fracture, then it is necessary to immerse a soft cloth in warm oil of tempered heat, or in rose oil: and place it in the circumference of the places that are between the groins, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	But if he feels pain, or pricking, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then enema him with a strengthening wine, black, warm: especially if the putrefaction has already reached the intestine, and has become a penetrating one up to its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that what is from the subtle ones is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine that is called the Jejunum does not receive healing from the wound that happens in it at all: and this is because of its multitude, which is from veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is pus, and you seek it out recently: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if it has passed a time, and it has already become green, or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place that has become discolored from it, so that blood does not flow.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in the zirbo are the veins and artery.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the pull on you will be relieved, and the extraction of it in case of a zirbo fracture, and the discharge of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Reminder of the wound that occurred in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the fracture occurs in the intestine and is small: then it is possible for some people to be restored: because I saw a man who was wounded in his abdomen with the impact of a lance, and it was a wound from the right stomach, and it was an old wound: and a fistula formed, and there was diarrhea and flatulence.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	Therefore I placed the treatment, until I was not confident in his healing: nor did I stop sophisticating him, until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the weak, that a bad thing would happen to him in his abdomen: and it did not happen to him from that bad thing.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and having sex, and entering the bath, and exercised in his meals.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And now some experimenters have said, that when the wound in the intestine occurs and is small: then it is necessary to bind it according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take ants of large heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two wound lips, and place one ant from those that have an open mouth on top of the two wound lips.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	When he places it on that, and clenches his mouth, cut off his head, for it sticks and does not come off.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing that with the ant after the second one according to the amount of the wound for the whole.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then bring him back, and heal his wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads remain attached in the intestines until the intestine is eaten, and healed, and no harm completely occurs to the sick person.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And now it is possible to tie the intestine even with a thin thread: which is removed from the animal's intestine, attached with it when it is inserted into the needle.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And there is, that you take the end of this thread from the intestine, and it is burned much.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the thin thread of the line unrolled at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the needle, and heal it with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then bring him back to the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with ants and intestine is not but according to the way of trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then there is no cure but suturing, and there is no healing at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	¶ Of the care of Zucchini, and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Chapter 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every wound, or an apostema when it becomes old and aged, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and emits pus always, and is not cut off: then it is universally called in whatever member it is Fistula, and we call it Zucchini.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	A fistula indeed is truly a strained, hard, white swelling; it has no pain, and no concavity of a bird's feather; and because of this some call it a "pennam," that is, a feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And in certain hours it emits pus, which is moist.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	Perhaps the moisture is torn apart in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	Sometimes this moisture is much and little, and it is coarse and fine.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, and no flesh is born in it, is not that except for one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of which is that because of the lack of blood in the body; or because of its evil nature; or because there is hard flesh between him and his lips, preventing the birth of flesh; or because it is full of dirt and filth; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter that is put into it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inconvenient in its cure; or because corruption is falling in the region, which is a kind of pestilence, or by the nature of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where digestion of sufferings becomes difficult, and healing of the abscess is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown all these causes and signs of them, and their cures with medicines in the division; and it is necessary for me to make you know the cure of Fistula and Zukon, which is made by the way of operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Know therefore that a fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from these are the fistulas that reach to great veins and arteries, or nerves, or sciatica: or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some part of the ribs: or to some part of the spine, or to the joints composed together, such as hands and feet: and from these are those that approach to the proximity of the main member, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, from these fistulas, according to this method, is difficult healing due to illnesses, and does not receive cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	But if it is from some fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I mentioned: and you hope and trust in its cure, and wish to approach to knowledge of it, then receive a probe from air, or iron, if the fistula tends towards straightness, and seek it with itself.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is twisting in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	Because lead, with its own gentleness, is relieved and cured around twisting.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	But if the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to signify over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cleanse from these openings one opening from its own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the moisture by which you cleanse itself goes towards other openings, and runs out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then carefully investigate according to what manner it is possible for you: so that you know what is the bone, or nerve, and whether the fistula's concavity is long or near: or whether it is one fistula which has many openings, and stands on the whole of it, with utmost strength of yours: with interrogation of your question, by which you interrogate the weak one, and invention of pain at compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of abscess.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you stand at that true station, then go to the cure according to your confidence: and it is, that you consider then, if it is a fistula near-appearing, or in a safe place far from the joint, or from the nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I told you: then seal the fistula according to what was previously said by me, and remove what is in it from filtration, and corrupt flesh, which is born in its opening from the flesh, or scar tissue, and similar things: and cure that, until it is healed.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	But if the fistula is of great depth, and is according to straightness: then it is necessary for you to seal it in the depth as much as is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all its corrupt flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer untouched linen in sharp medicines: and insert it up to the concavity of the fistula which you comprehended with iron: do with it several times, until the sharp medicine eats away everything that remains in the concavity of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal by that, then cauterize it according to what we have said.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	But if the cause of the fistula is a bone, and it is certified to you that it is so: then inquire into that, and seal it according to what I have told you: if something does not prevent you from the vein, or nerve, or principal member, as we said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	But if a bone is revealed to you, and there is something of corruption and discoloration in it: then scrape it, until the corruption of it is all removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that wound with the same thing that caused it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If it does not heal and emits pus as it did before, then you know that you have not reached the complete elimination of corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then clean it again with a second layer, and carefully make a thorough examination of it, and its cleansing with your utmost strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If it heals, then it is good; but if not, then you know that the corruption is deep within the body, which you have not reached.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	Therefore, it is not your ability to cure it, unless you let go of nature.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If the corrupted part is small and it is possible for you, then pull it out with fine forceps that are suitable for it.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then carefully make the extraction of all of them, and do not leave anything with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if something gives you opposition from the moistures, and there is no fear or error in the incision of them, then cut those moistures and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at your time, then place on the wound that it may putrefy itself: and let go of it, until what is in the vicinity of those bones from flesh and moistures putrefies.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the wound so that it may not consolidate.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And be bound the incision that you cut in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	But if you fear, then place on it, a piece of cloth soaked in finely ground sulfur with oil: or a piece of cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some green herb of unguents.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	When those moistures putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, the removal of them is relieved, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however there is one great bone, such as the thigh bone, or the hip bone, and similar to them, and what is corrupted from it is a large part: then shave it with the last reason, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	But if what is in it corrupted is a large part, and corruption has already followed the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it, and cut it all the way to where corruption reached: then care for it, until it consolidates.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you zuken, which happened to a man in his thigh: so that you may place that example and help on your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man about thirty years old, to whom pain came in his thigh, from a cause that moved over him within the body, that is, from inside, until the matter reached the leg, and there was a large abscess: and he did not have an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore he was extended with him for a time with the error of doctors, until the abscess was opened, and many matters came together with him.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And the cure of him was postponed until the leg was fistulated, and there were made in it many openings: all of which emitted pus and body moistures.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	Therefore he was cared for by many doctors for about two years, and there was not in him a wise one in the art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the matters that were running out from those openings with great speed: even all his man's body had become shriveled, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	If you insert a probe into one of the body's openings, and it reaches the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found that they all reach each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	I therefore cut through one of those openings, and I found that the bone itself was rotten: which was already decayed, discolored, and rotten, and perforated, until it reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I therefore cut off what was found by me, and prepared it from the rotten bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I appointed that there was not in the bone except that corruption which I cut and prepared.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I placed the healing of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it was not consolidated.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I probed and cut above the first detection, and I found continuous corruption with the bone: and I prepared what appeared to me even from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I attempted its healing.
Et non est restauratum.	And it was not healed.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	I therefore cut through it again, and I did not stop cutting the bone individually, and trying to heal it: and it was not healed until I cut through the bone almost a span, and extracted it with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I healed it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed: and there was no need for this repetition in the operation of it, and its cutting, except because of the weakness of the infirm person, and the scarcity of his tolerance, and my fear of him regarding death: because he was dying from excessive evacuation diseases every hour.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	The patient was healed by a complete cure: and flesh was born in the place of the bone, and it was good for the arrangement in his body, and his strength returned to him: and he returned to his proper conditions: and he did not do him any harm at all in walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if the bone is already broken in the place of the body: then it is necessary to bind it thus: and it is as follows: take a bandage, and tie it at the end of the protruding bone: and order someone to pull it upwards: and put another bandage made of thicker wool first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh, which is under the bone: and extend its end, so that you can pull the flesh downwards: and cover the flesh on the place that you want to saw, so that it does not cut the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a piece of wood, or a board under the lower bone, because when you do this, it does not prevent the flesh from becoming rotten.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the cut be on the place of the corruption for a little while, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the sense, and forces it to its own purpose another way.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	But if the bone is corrupted, and it is not protruding, but rather it continues with its part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in its own part: then cover the flesh from all parts completely.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wood underneath.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then saw it from the first side, where the corruption is, until the cut continues from the other side: and let the cut be according to the length from the corruption for a little while, as we said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	But if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone from the other side where it continues.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If indeed there is corruption in the continuity of two joints, then there is no skill in it except for amputation.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If however the corruption is in the pectine of the hand or the pectine of the foot, then the matter is quite difficult indeed.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	However, you must indeed investigate how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And amputate it, and clean it according to any possible arrangement that is possible for you, and with any ingenuity, correct it for you, when it does not give you opposition of the vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that there are many teeth and saws for cutting these bones according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and subtlety of them, and magnitude, and parity of them, and hardness of them, and rarity of them.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, you must prepare every kind of instrument suitable for that operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations signify to you above the kind of instrument that you lack, when with you is the study of a long time.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of this art is a testimony of the ways of ailments, for then you will already find through yourself that which is suitable to him from the instruments for every infirmity.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am strengthening you at the last number of this chapter's instruments, which you will place examples upon which you will cut, and proof by which you experiment on others.
Forma Serrae.	The form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The form of another saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw should be made well.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its upper arc be made sharp from iron: and its handle from boxwood, and let it be pyramidally made well.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The Form of the Razor for Joining Wounds.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The head of this razor should be shaped according to the star-shaped form of a claw hammer, and its points should be in the form of the points of an eyelash.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	It is not suitable for anything other than to rub against the heads of joined wounds when they are decaying, or for a large mouth, and it is very large.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The Form of the Larger Razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The Form of the Medium-Sized Razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The Form of the Wide Razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The Form of the Razor with a Hollow.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The Form of the Other Delicate Razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The Form of the Other Curved-Handle Razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The Form of the Small, Delicate Tentative Razor.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The Form of the Razor with Which Bones are Inserted.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Also, the Form of the Large Razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a saw, and its handle is like a serrated edge: it will be shown in many places due to the reason of bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The Form of the Razor that is suitable for its reason which is perforated from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its handle is triangular, and its tip is sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made of indigo.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it should be made of all the things we have said from razors, and saws, and serrated edges.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	On Incising the Extremities, and Sawing Bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The extremities putrefy, either from an external cause or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have cured that corruption with medical treatment, and the cure does not take effect: and you see the corruption spreading to a member, which nothing rebounds against: then it is necessary for you to incise that member as far as the corruption follows, so that the weak one may pass through it from death, or from the malice which is greater than the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that this happens is that the limb becomes discolored, until it is thought to have been burned by fire or has decayed after a gangrenous condition: until that putrefaction spreads to the following limb, and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, as soon as the incision is made, and if the cause of corruption is from the impact of certain poisonous creatures: such as sea scorpions, and vipers, and rattle snakes, and similar ones.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption or impact is at the end of the finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption, so that it does not spread to the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the forearm, and do not leave space for the corruption, until it reaches the elbow.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it invades it, then cut the arm at the elbow in its joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if the corruption passes through and you see it around the elbow: then there is death of the weak one.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer besides that from the cure, is a quantity of power.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly do with the foot, when the corruption invades in the finger, then cut it at one joint: and if it reaches the patella of the foot, then cut the foot entirely.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it climbs up to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	But if the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no cure in it, except release, and leaving the weak one to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting the limb, or of clamping it is, to tie the ligament in the lower part, which you wish to cut: and tie the ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	The assistant should extend one of the ligaments downwards and the other superior ligament upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you should separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a narrow spatula, until the flesh is completely exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut or squeezed.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to place bandages on all parts of the cloth, and not touch the healthy part with the saw: and an added injury occurs to the sick person, and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if blood flows internally while operating, then cauterize the place quickly: or place on top of it some powders that absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medical treatment until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with the appropriate ligament to it, and care for it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, the same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because blackness occurred in his foot, with burning that resembles the burning of fire: and that corruption first occurred in his finger, until it began to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man removed himself from himself, after he saw the corruption spreading in his member with its intensity, which he found from the pain and burning of it: and it happened to him at the junction, and he was healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, the same corruption happened to him in his finger of his hand index.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Therefore he came to me, and I tried to recover that excess with him which I put on his hand from medicines after the cleansing of his body: and the excess was not reflected back, and it began to spread to another finger: until the corruption began in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He therefore called me to cut off his hand: and I was unwilling to do it, hoping for a reflection on the excess of that fluctuation: and I also feared even for him at the time of the cutting off of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the power of man was over the fall.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	After he therefore gave up hope in me, he returned to his land: and he came to me from him, because he hurried, and he cut off his hand entirely: and he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this story, unless it be a help on that which falls from this kind of sickness: and that there be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the care of sinews, and the quality of cataplasm with medicines.
Caput XC.	Chapter 90
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy members, and the time of the abscess is prolonged until it makes a collection of pus: then it bursts or is pierced, and what is in it from the pus goes out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel: and the skin that is on top of it like a fabric that has already become thin: and it does not reach to its final corruption, nor does it touch the mouth, nor the nerve, nor the ligament: it deserves to be called a sinus: and it is not called a fistula: but if the time of its duration is prolonged until it touches any of these members with corruption, then it is called a fistula, or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And its care is, that I cut off that skin entirely as it rolls back: and especially when it has become thin, and made like a fabric: and you trust that it will not stick to the place, because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you hope that the skin will stick to the place, and that final corruption will not follow from it: and if there is thickness in the skin from flesh, then care for it with cataplasm: and it is, that you consider towards the sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then, if it is large and the pus that emits from it has a foul odor, cleanse it with the Egyptian medicine, which is acetum, oil, and zinziber, equal parts mixed together in a vessel. Heat them over fire until the medicine turns red and thickens like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take what you need from it and dissolve it with water and honey, and cleanse the sinus with it. Close the opening and leave the medicine in it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then remove it with expression and do this for several days until the sinus is cleaned and the odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And sometimes cleanse it with water and ash when you do not have this medicine present: take charcoal from willow or holm oak trees and throw water on it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then wash it and cleanse it with it until you trust that the sinus is now cleansed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water and charcoal, then cleanse it with water and honey to which some crushed zinziber has already been added.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or cleanse it with mixed honey and wine because of the property of honey that it cleansses and washes: and wine makes the sinus stick, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this several times and trust that the corruption is now removed, then cleanse it with what causes flesh to grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is, that you take from the plaster dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine: or cleanse it with certain other medicines and ointments whose properties I have written about in my treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the orifice of the sinus is narrow and does not accommodate a catheter, then slightly widen it with a needle: or place a piece of lint soaked in Egyptian oil or basilikum ointment inside it until it is widened.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	Similarly, if the orifice is also large, then gather its lips with a suture and allow the amount that the catheter enters without adding anything.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	Similarly, if the orifice from which the pus flows is elevated, then dry it in a lower position that is inside it, so that the pus flows out downwards: for when pus is confined in the depths of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is not possible for you to dry the sinus around its lower part as you wish, then try to prepare the member by the preparation by which the pus flows out of it with ease according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to ensure that nothing at all from the pus remains in it: and take consolidating medicines that are placed on the sign, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them on linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	Let the cloth be of such a quantity that it covers the entire sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps directly into the orifice of the sinus, more than the orifice of the sinus slightly.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the mild ointments on another cloth, according to the quantity of the opening: and place it on it with a long position away from the orifice of the sinus, so that the exit of the pus from it is relieved: and do not remove a large cloth unless after several days.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But the one that is on the orifice of the sinus is the one that you remove every hour, so that what accumulates in it from the pus exits: and so that you know whether the thing that flows out of it is much, or little: or digested, or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And again consider this place of the sinus, whether the master feels pain there, or if there is no pain in it, and whether there is an abscess in it, or if there is no abscess in it.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	Therefore, when your medication is applied in this way, and you see the material that issues from the opening of the sinus, then you know that the sinus has already adhered or is approaching adhesion: then therefore dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you heal the wound, then replace the cloth with a new one, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a subtle virus issues from the sinus after a long time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to that.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if a undigested pus issues from the sinus after many days, then you know that the sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	Therefore, if the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its matter is prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, but let the doctors make them so that they are medicines in their wet substance and in their dry virtue, as is the ointment dyafinicon when superfluity of addition is added to it from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last thing that is cured, it is, that you take the ointment dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and moisten it with equal old wine in its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then finish it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And now he performs a similar action when there is no ointment dyafinicon present for you, honey, when you dissolve it, until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, pound them all together, and powder it over melted honey while it is still on the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then apply the linen cloth above it, and tie it over the wound: and with the honey that you have boiled, while it is still hot, fill it until it is full: and powder the specified species on top of it, and place it on the cloth, and tie it.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes aristolochia longa, and the roots of the blue lily, and the lily itself, and the flour of the herb, and centaury are administered in it.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them either simple or combined, grind them, and grind the mortar itself: and powder it on the honey that I have boiled, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the wound persists and is not healed by this treatment, then you will know that there is corruption in its depths: or it has already made an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or ligaments: then cure it with the treatment of fistulas, as it was previously prescribed.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	¶ On the care of onychia and the worn nail, and the incision of the finger added, and the section.
Caput XCI.	Chapter 91.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Onychia is an abscess that arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand, or of the foot: and perhaps it arises in the other fingers as well.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When therefore the matter persists and is neglected in its treatment, and it becomes an abscess with hot abscess: or it rots and emits pus, until it corrodes the root of the nail: and perhaps it rots it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul odor to it: and it becomes the end of the finger broad, and its color is dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When therefore you are treating it yourself, since as we said in the division, and you do not apply your own cure: then it is necessary that you cut with a knife all the remaining superfluity that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For a cauterizing iron is very helpful.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If indeed the mouth is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the empty spaces of the nail are already compressing the flesh to the interior, and they begin to prick it, and they wound it: then it is necessary that you place a fine radium under the angle of the nail which is pricking the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut the flesh with ease, and put on top of what remains of the flesh from medicines burning, corrosive, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	But if the corruption has already pressed into the mouth, then it is necessary that you cut that mouth, and remove it: for it will never be healed as long as the corrupted mouth remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	But if you see the corrosion and corruption proceeding into the finger, then cut it at one node, according to what was previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	But if an accident occurs to the nail, such as a break or blow: and pain occurs in it, then it is necessary that you let blood from the sick person first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula transversely from above to the sight.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard, that the cut does not reach the flesh which is under the nail, for you will cause an accident to occur through it above the sick person's severe pain, and it will be a cause of new birth of flesh in that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with that which soothes pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	However, the digitus added to some people's hands, which is born in some people's hands, perhaps it is entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birth is in some knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	Therefore, that which is born in some knots of the finger, does not move: and that which is born at the joint of the finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, for him who is fleshy from among them, his cutting is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	That is, so that you cut it at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But for him whose birth is at the root of the joint, his cure is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, refrain from cutting it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	However, for him who is born in the finger at the last knot, then you should cut into the first flesh of his round cut up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then saw the bone with one of those saws that are suitable for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it, until it is healed.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the consolidation that happens to fingers together often happens from the birth of man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, you should separate that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place between them a lint, or cloths soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate between them: or place between them a thin sheet of lead, until the place consolidates as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	Similarly, if a consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then dry that consolidation according to how it is prepared and fits the figure of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	On Incising a Wound.
Caput XCII.	Chapter 92.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	Veins are often twisted, thick, and full of melancholic superfluities that occur in many parts of the body: and their greatest event is found in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk, work, and carry.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore it is necessary for caretakers to frequently shake the body with strong shaking from black choler.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then, the vein of the patient is bleeding in the basilica.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of these with iron, however, is according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One of them is that they are dried and the black blood is drawn out.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	The other mode is that the vein is raised and all the blood is drawn out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of it, however, is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First, warm water is applied to the leg, until the thick, dirty blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then, the weak leg is tied from its upper part of the hip to its lower part with a ligature, with a rope.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then, the vein is cut in one place, or two, or three places, with a wide incision.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then, raise it, that is, draw the blood from the lower part of the leg, upwards, and from the upper part, it is necessary for the phlebotomist to first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then, cut the nail with a knife until it goes down to the blood: until the amount of blood that you see is enough and what the strength of the sick person can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Afterwards, tie her up: and order her to abstain from foods that generate black bile: and repeat evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and it harms the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	However, his evacuation is done in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Shave the leg of the sick person if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then introduce him into the bath: or broil him in the leg of his thigh with hot water until it reddens, and the veins are full: or exercise strong exercise, if there is no bath present, until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin directly over the vein section along its length: or at the last of his knee, or in the lower part of his heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides, until it appears to the sense: and at its appearance, that you see it reddening towards the descending blackness.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When therefore it goes out of the skin, you see it white like a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then introduce it under it Radium, until when it is evacuated and goes out of the skin: suspend it with a blind hook, gently.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry another section near that section three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the vein, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then evacuate it with Radii as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry another section, or several sections, if you need that one.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then evacuate, and cut the last section at the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then remove it to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And make him do this, until you extract it from the higher or more elevated section than all others, until when it comes out completely: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you in being extracted and raised: then insert a sharp needle with strong thread doubled, and tie it, and extract it: or insert under it Radium: and turn your hand to all parts, until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And beware, do not cut it.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it is cut, it becomes difficult for you to raise it greatly, and enters into the weakest part of it, causing harm.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then when you have extracted it all: then place it on the wound with immersed thread in wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it until it is healed.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	But if the wound is contracted, having a twisted shape to which there is no covering to all parts, and it is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you suture over it to all part of its twisted shape, and locations of its covering.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with sutures, until you raise it all: and beware at your cutting on it that you do not cut the vein, or wound: for it will be difficult for you to raise it, or extract it.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore preserve your wisdom.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The Form of Incision for the Healing of a Wound.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The Form of Suturing a Blind Wound.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It does not have straightness like other sutures, nor is it sharp at its extremities, so as not to wound the vein: and it is thick in its twisted shape, mild: because if it were subtle, it would cut the vein with its subtlety: indeed it should have excessive thickness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the Extraction of the Leg Vein.
Caput XCIII.	Chapter 93.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in warm lands, such as those of the Almohads and the Arabs, and in dry, warm, thin lands, that is, where there grows neither herb nor tree.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation indeed is from the putrefaction that occurs beneath the skin, just as snakes and worms of ascarides occur within the bodies, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that which occurs in the leg, a severe inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the location is incised.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from that location of incision, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When therefore it appears from that end of it, then you must wrap around it a fragment of lead, whose weight is from a drachma keil, up to two drachmas and the knot: and let the lead suspended from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever therefore something exits from it to the outsides, wrap that in lead, and knot it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is prolonged much, then incise its part, and wrap the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not incise it root and branch before it has all exited.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	Because if you incise it, it contracts, and enters into the flesh: and causes an abscess, and putrefaction in that location, and an evil wound.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary that it be gently handled, and extracted gradually, until it exits from its last part, and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this vein indeed some men exit with that which is in its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now he has reached me, because a man has departed from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it happens to you at the time of your medical treatment: then introduce the radium through its hole, and perforate it with a long one, with the body, until everything that is in it is evacuated from the matter: and administer putrefaction of the site with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then care for him with the care of the abscess.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings occur to him, and he goes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Then care for it, as we said in the division, and with that which was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	¶ About cutting the worms generated under the skin, and it is called 'Bouina Disease'.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter 94.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called 'Bouina Disease' in a certain land among us: because often it happens to worms, and it is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes through the whole body, ascending and descending: and it shows itself to the sense during its walk from member to member, until it breaks wherever it breaks in the skin, and goes out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As worms and snakes, that is, roundworms and ascarides, happen in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And it is feared from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it goes through the body, and is raised to the head, and reaches the place: then perhaps it opens in it, and goes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens often.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure him and extract him, then it is not done except at his walking and the appearance of himself to his sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, you must bind what is above him and what is below him with a strong bandage in constriction.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above him, and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a hot iron on the spot until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And the greater danger is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see that it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind under it with a good eyebrow bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then cut above him, and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that the sick person cleanse his body with a medicine dissolving foul humors badly.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction in him.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	¶ On cutting above a soreness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Chapter 95.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This soreness is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that occurs in certain members, then it changes from member to member.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And indeed I have already seen it myself, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to an ill woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she exposed her arm, and I saw a small inflation in the vein of the forearm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after I remained for an hour, I saw one inflation moving with the fire, like a snake, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible: so that it was like live silver when running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	The pain therefore departed from that place, and it was fixed on her shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat for one hour, and it rushed into the remaining body, until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was turning around in his whole body, as I had seen.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I was therefore amazed at the speed of its movement from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And indeed, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in this way before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	Nevertheless, I had seen many who found pain moving from limb to limb, and I had not seen it with my own eyes as I had seen it in that woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it is otherwise than because she was from those who are from the dry uterus of the detected veins, hence it appears to the senses that this movement is caused by wind.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and have moist bodies, of hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When therefore you wish to cure him, and the patient feels that pain: then if it is apparent to your eye, as we said, then bind quickly above it, and under it: and dry above it, until that windiness is confined: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	But if you do not see it with your own eyes: then cure him with the shaking of his body, and with that which expels windiness, and charm them with fetid pills, and pills of juniper, and similar things.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	CONCERNING THE EXTRACTION OF ARROWS.
Caput XCVI.	CAPTION 96.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	ARROWS DIFFER ACCORDING TO THEIR KIND AND ACCORDING TO THE PLACES IN WHICH THEY FALL FROM THE BODY.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	BUT THIS DIVERSITY IS GREAT, BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME WHICH HAVE LARGE AND SMALL, SHARP AND BLUNT POINTS: AND HOLEY AND DEAF ONES.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And among them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And among them are those which have a tongue.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And among them are those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those however which are according to the members in which they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For indeed the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar things.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	Therefore when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I tell you afterward, then you should avoid the extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows him in whom it is, in many positions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when those evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For from the signs of the brain when the arrow falls into it, and penetrates the mouth, and exits that which is on top of the brain, there are: because they happen from it strong pain, scotomia, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflation, redness of the tongue, spasm, and confusion of the intellect, and vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps it exits blood from the nostrils, or from the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is cut off, and voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And it exits from the place of the wound white fluid similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it exits from that similar to the humidity of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	Therefore if those signs appear to you, then avoid the care, and extract the arrow if it does not exit.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of the arrow however when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left nipple: and feels with it as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in a vacant one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the motion of an arrow is similar to the motion of a blow: and black blood runs from the wound.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And then follows extreme coldness, and cold sweat, and syncope.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore know that death is certainly approaching.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the frothy discharge of blood from the wound: and the boils that follow around the neck become inflamed, and the color of the sick person changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And he will breathe out a great, deep breath: and he will seek the cooling of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the breast, which is in the chest: then it is near the small ribs: and a great panting with intense pain, with a sigh: and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from food comes out of the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is fixed in it: something of feces comes out of the wound, or a mass, or an intestine that is already torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine comes out of it: and something proceeds from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger on the sick person: then you will know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	But the other limbs, such as the face, and the neck, and the throat, and the shoulder blade, and the ribs, and the wings, and the hip, and the leg, and the like are saved from these members according to many arrangements: when the arrow does not find an artery, or a nerve: and it is not a poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you what I have seen of these arrows, as you indicate in your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	Because an arrow fell into the lacrimal duct of a man's eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore, I extracted it from the other side, under the ear's fat: and he was healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I extracted an arrow from a Jew, which had fallen into the fat of his eye under the lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I could only get out of it except its small tip, with which it adheres to its reed: and it was a large arrow among the arrows of the Turks, with a weak iron, in which there are no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	The Jew was therefore healed, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is that which has ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore, I cut it above it between two tongues: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	I was careful with it as I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted an arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After therefore thirty days had passed over him, and nothing changed on him from his dispositions, I cut above the arrow: and I peeled it off, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no harm came to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen on his back, and the wound was consolidated over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After therefore it was after seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his thigh.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	I saw a woman who had an arrow lodged in her womb and the wound was healed over it, and the arrow remained inside her: and there was no change in her posture or condition, and she did not find any harm from any of her natural functions.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	I also saw a man who had an arrow lodged in his face: and the wound was healed over it, and he did not find much pain from it: and there were many similar cases.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	I also extracted the arrow from a man of high rank, who had it lodged in the middle of his nose, and it had already begun to lean towards the right side a little: and the arrow was hidden completely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I was therefore called to treat him after the accident with the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the wound of the arrow to be quite tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I therefore examined it with a fine probe, and I did not feel it: but he himself found a pricking and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that this pricking was from the tip of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I therefore applied a plaster with a property that attracts and digests, confident that the wound would become an abscess and I would be able to see the sign of the arrow so that I could cut it above: and nothing happened in that place which indicated that the arrow had followed its path.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I therefore applied the plaster to him for many days: and nothing happened which was not intended, and the wound healed in the meantime: and he remained weak from the extraction of it for several days, until he felt the arrow inside his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I therefore placed a sharp and corrosive medicine on that wound for many days until it was open: and when I examined him with a fine probe, I felt the tip of the arrow which adhered to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the incision of the wound through that sharp medicine, until the visible end of the arrow appeared to us: and it passed by me with it a certain period of time, approximately four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had been enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert pincers into it and move it, but it did not obey my commands: then I did not cease to sharpen and devise various ways of using the pincers on it, until I began to extract it on a certain day with well-made pincers, according to the form of their ends at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And indeed, the doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	I therefore restored it, and the wound was healed, and the sick person was cured with complete health: nor did anything at all harm him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I tell you the quality of extracting some arrows: so that you may place that rule and signification on that which I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with narration: nor does that book comprehend it, and a wise craftsman compares with little on much: and with what is present, he compares to what is absent: and he finds a new operation and a new instrument among the descents of things extraneous to this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say therefore, that arrows do not exit from the members in which they are fixed, except according to two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Either by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which exits from where it entered is either an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and it is attracted and exits.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not comply with the outcome from the hour in which it falls: then it is necessary to let it go for several days, until the flesh that is around it rots: and its attraction is eased, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	Similarly, if it sticks to the bone, and does not comply with you for exit, then let it go also for several days: and repeat it with attraction and motion every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not comply with you for exit after days, then it is necessary to bore through the circumference of the arrow in the same bone from all parts with a thin drill, until the arrows are enlarged.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and extract it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	But if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already proceeded into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those accidents that I mentioned appear: then abstain from the attraction of the arrow, and let it go, until it is equal to its state after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the sigmoid, then death is not prolonged to it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate up to the sigmoid: and he remains weak for several days, and none of those accidents happens to him: then use ingenuity in the attraction of the arrow and extraction of it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	But if it is fixed greatly, and does not comply with you for attraction: then administer drills around the arrow, as I told you: then care for the place, until it is healed.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	But if the arrow is already hidden in the place of the body, and it is hidden and concealed from sense: then seek it with touch.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	But if you feel it, then attract it with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot place it above the wound due to its constriction and the length of the arrow in a deep location where there is no bone, nerve, or vein: then pierce it on top of the wound until it expands, making it possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If there are ears to which it can be tied, then free the attached flesh from all parts, with every skill you have, and skills, if it cannot be placed above the flesh in the fracture of the ears and their twisting, until it is removed.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any location, then use the twisting of your hand with forceps to all parts, until you make it escape: and with subtlest subtleties, so that the arrow is not broken, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it and extract it.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot place it above the wound in one hour, then let it go for several days until the rotten parts around it are putrid.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for the tunica will be healed if indeed it causes you opposition in the flow of blood, then administer what we said from the cure in its chapter: and guard your skill from incision of vein, or nerve, or string.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer skill in every way that is possible for you to escape the arrow: and let it be with facility, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, it should be weak according to its shape, according to which it was at the accident of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	But if it is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that exits from the opposite side of the other part, or has already begun to protrude from it towards the outside: or it causes a swelling at the tip of the arrow by sensation from the upper part of the skin near it, and you see it protruding: therefore cut above it, and make the incision according to the amount that the forceps can take in it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then pull it out: for it will become easy to exit.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If indeed it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness, until the arrow is pressed into the bone and expands itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: leave it for several days: then repeat it, until it exits.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the wood of the arrow is in it, then push it with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	But if the wood has fallen off, and you want to apply a blow: then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters into the tail of the arrow: then push it with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	But if the arrow is concave, then push it with an inserting instrument.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the arrow is relieved by that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	But if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to hollow out all the flesh in which the poison is: if it is possible for you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it with what suits it.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	But if the arrow is falling in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side: and it is near what you touch with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and avoid the incision of the vein, or nerve, and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then care for its wound, if you see it, and heal it, until it is healed.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	This is the form of forceps used for removing arrows.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	The tips of these forceps are similar to a bird's beak, made of iron, and when they grip the arrow, they do not let go of it.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	There are many varieties of these forceps, large and small, medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its flexibility, and the width and constriction of the wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	The shape of the pusher is concave.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	The shape of the pusher is blind.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the blind tip of the pusher, shaped like a radius, to facilitate its insertion into the concave arrow and to be pushed with it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	The tip of the pusher for the concave arrow is concave like a bird's feather, to facilitate its insertion into the arrow and its impact.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum.	On bloodletting from veins.
Caput XCVII.	Chapter 97.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.	The veins that are usually bled in the body are thirty.
Ex quibus in capite sunt sexdecim: duae Venae pulsatiles, quae sunt post aures, dictae duae Herbae: et duae Arteriae, quae sunt in duobus timporibus apparentes: et duae Venae quae sunt in duobus lachrymalibus duorum oculorum, quae dicuntur Aspicientes: et Vena praeparata in medio frontis: et uena quae est in extremitate nasi.	Of these, there are sixteen in the head: two pulsatile veins behind the ears, called the "herbs"; and two arteries that are visible on the temples; and two veins at the corners of both eyes, called the "aspirants"; and a prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and a vein at the end of the nose.
Et duae Guidegi, quae sunt in collo.	And two jugular veins that are in the neck.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio superiore oris.	And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth.
Et duae uenae quae sunt in labio inferiore.	And two veins that are in the lower lip.
Et istae sunt uenae quae dicuntur Algecherich.	These are called the "alche-rich" veins.
Et duae uenae quae sunt sub lingua.	And two veins that are under the tongue.
Venae autem quae phlebotomantur in brachiis, sunt quinque uenae in omni brachio.	In the arms, the veins that are bled are five in each arm.
Vna earum est Cephalica, et est ex latere syluestri: et nominat eam uulgus uenam capitis.	One of them is called the cephalic vein, and it is located on the sulcus of the elbow; people also call it the arm vein.
Et Fusca.	And the dark one.
Et est Media uena, et est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae: et nominat eam uulgus uenam corporis.	And there is the median vein, which is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic; people also call it the body vein.
Et Basilica, et est posita in latere domestico: et nominatur etiam Titillicaris.	And there is the basilica vein, which is located on the domestic sulcus; it is also called the titilous vein.
Et nominat eam uulgus uenam uentris.	People also call it the abdominal vein.
Et Funis brachii, et est posita super focile: et est illa in qua phlebotomatur, et est illa quae apparet supra pollicem appatitione manifesta.	And there is the brachial cord vein, which is located above the elbow; it is the one that is bled from and the one that appears above the thumb.
Et Saluatella: et est uena quae est inter annularem et minimum: et sunt ei duo rami.	And there is the salivate vein, which is located between the ring and the little finger; it has two branches.
Et in crure et in pede sunt tres uenae.	And in the leg and foot, there are three veins.
Vna earum est quae est sub pollicis curuatura ex latere syluestri.	One of them is located under the thumb arch on the sulcus of the elbow.
Et secunda est Saphena: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere domestico.	And the second one is the saphenous vein; its location is near the heel, on the domestic sulcus.
Et uena Nesse: et locus eius est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	And there is the nesse vein; its location is near the heel, on the sulcus of the elbow.
Et in crure alio sunt tres uenae similes illis.	And in the leg, there are three other veins similar to those mentioned earlier.
¶ De phlebotomia duarum uenarum post Aures.	On bleeding from two veins after the ears.
Phlebotomiae uero duarum uenarum quae sunt post Aures, iuuamentum est ad catarros antiquos, et hemigraneam, et sahafati, et ulcera capitis mala antiqua.	Bleeding from the two veins that are after the ears is a remedy for ancient cataracts, hemiglanea, sahefati, and old head sores.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eam est secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the bleeding is as I have described.
Et est, ut radatur caput infirmi: et fricetur occipitium eius in loco duarum uenarum cum panno aspero fricatione bona.	And it is, that the head of the sick person should be shaved: and the back of his head should be rubbed with a rough cloth in the place of the two veins.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum cum uitta, donec appareant duae uenae.	Then the sick person should tie his neck with a bandage until two veins appear.
Et loca earum sunt post Aures in duobus locis depressis capitis.	And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed places of the head.
Quaere ergo eas digito tuo, et ubi sentis pulsum earum sub digito tuo, illic signa cum encaustro.	Therefore ask for them with your finger, and where you feel them pulsed under your finger, there mark with the caustic.
Deinde accipe phlebotomum cultellarem, et est ille qui dicitur Incidens.	Then take a lancet phlebotomist, and he is called the Incisor.
Deinde intromitte ipsum sub uena in cute, donec perueniat phlebotomus ad os.	Then insert it under the vein into the skin, until the lancet reaches the bone.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum uena et cute ad superiora, et incide uenam cum cute incisione incidente.	Then clean your hand with the vein and skin to the upper parts, and cut the vein with the Incisor incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quantitas duorum digitorum iunctorum, aut circiter illud: et fac exire ex sanguine quantum uis.	And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers joined together, or about that: and make it bleed out as much blood as you wish.
Deinde stringe eam cum puluillis, et dimitte eam, donec sanetur.	Then bind it with bandages, and let it go, until it is healed.

Et quandoque aperitur cum phlebotomo lato.	And sometimes it opens with a wide phlebotome.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut sit phlebotomus acutae extremitatis, sicut reliqui phlebotomi, imo sit latae extremitatis.	However, it is not necessary for the phlebotomist to be sharp-witted like other phlebotomists, but rather should be broad-minded.
Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	§ On bloodletting from the vein under the tongue after cephalic bloodletting.

However, of the two veins which are under the tongue, bloodletting is a remedy: because cephalic bloodletting is for prefacations which are in the throat, and pain of the jaw, and pains of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.

¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	§ On the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	The three veins that are bled in the arm, it is customary to bleed from them in all people.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And bleeding from them is done in two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Either by pricking with a broad-leafed bleeding lancet, or by olive oil for its subtlety of the incline, or by cutting with a knife and a bleeding bowl, and it is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is, which is suitable for cutting.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And from them are the species of broad and subtle according to the width and constriction of the veins. The form of the bleeding lancet should be broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	And it is suitable for opening deep, full, protruding, visible, thick veins, and those that contain thick, cloudy blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this bleeding lancet is of smaller width and more subtle at the tip.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	And it is suitable for bleeding from thin veins that contain thin, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	About the bleeding of the basilica.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	The basilica, which is one of these three veins for bleeding, is a support.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from illnesses that are under the chin and neck, from the chest and abdomen, and follows the course of the body. And it is suitable for the bleeder with the bleeding lancet to be careful and have caution from it because under it is the artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If therefore he errs and adds to the puncture of the bleeding lancet, he will cut that artery, and blood will flow.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary that he not bleed it with the bleeding lancet pricking: rather he should be cutting with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	If the Basilica does not appear manifestly, then you should change it with foreign ones, or ask for a branch of it: or perform phlebotomy in place of its arm's cord.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is indeed manifest, and dry it with a phlebotomist's sponge, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to perform phlebotomy on it, then you should do it before the stricture of the arm, touching the place until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then mark the place with a hot iron, then the arm, and dry the vein with a hollow cut with a phlebotomist's sponge, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And beware that the blow does not fall through the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, with your bandaging, the swelling in the place which you marked with the hot iron, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery: therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	But if you see blood coming out at the phlebotomy, like the urine of a child, and it is thin and red: then you will know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore hasten, and put your finger on it for a long space, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If therefore the blood is cut off (for often it is cut off), then bind the arm, and let it go: and beware that the weak one is not moved from its motion: and let it be on the fear of it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not move it for several days until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you: and there is no medicine present for you at your moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	The extremities are contracted, and the blood is cut off.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of bandage from the fist, and apply it: take half of it, and tie it over the wound site properly, with a ligature and cotton up to another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then care for it with the one who preceded its remembrance from the place of dust removing the blood flow: and the cutting off of his blood is not difficult in many positions, because of the small wound location, and the possibility of a ligature from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	About the bleeding of the great vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the great vein is a good thing for bleeding, which draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower body: because it is composed of the branch of the Basilic, and the branch of the Cephalic, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is fitting for the bleeder to be above the fear of from its bleeding, because under it is a nerve.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	If therefore he adds to the bleeding point, and finds a nerve, it happens in her stupor, and difficult is its cure, and perhaps not completely cured.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some men, and is subtle, and does not show: then it is necessary that you put your bleeding where the bleeder, cutting with a needle, and separation of the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	About the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	Phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is a remedy, because it draws blood from the head and brings it to eye ailments.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is proper in this vein, if you wish, to perform phlebotomy by puncturing with an olive oil phlebotome or a myrtle phlebotome: because it is safer than all veins, since it does not have an accompanying artery or nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is appropriate for you during phlebotomy to direct the phlebotome towards the head of the lizard and seek a less painful spot: and it does not harm it if it is not found with the first blow, but can be repeated with phlebotomy several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	However, it may perhaps abscess in some people when it is not performed with the first blow, but it does not harm them with that abscess in some place.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of phlebotomy and precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality of phlebotomy and its accidents from which you should think of its correction.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First of all, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except for the preservation of health and its continuity, and caution against the onset of ailments.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And so that phlebotomy may be performed in one of the three veins that are in the elbow, namely the cephalic, fusca, and basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And so that phlebotomy may be performed at the beginning of spring on fasting, in spring, and in summer: and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And it should be performed on the first day, or on the third, after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	Phlebotomy, which is administered in ailments, does not have a determined hour: but when it is provoked by convenience and necessity to that, at night, or at day, and in every hour, and in every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary for children to be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Neither should a pregnant woman be bled, unless from the fourth month until the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should elderly people who have already passed sixty years be bled.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	When therefore someone wants to be bled for any reason whatsoever, it is necessary that he clean his intestines before the bleeding with a mild enema, if there is much feces retained in them: so that the veins at the time of the bleeding do not draw out from the intestines superfluous putrid things harmful to the principal members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient with nausea, that is, satiety of vomiting, be bled, nor one who is full, nor one who avoids drunkenness, until it is removed from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor a sick person with hydropsy.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let it be guarded against bleeding again after colic pain, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and multiplication of coitus, and labor, and exercise, and vigils, and fasting, and every thing that dissolves the strength from the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if it is possible for him to have that.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then he should enter the bath, if nothing prohibits it: or he should be exercised in some exercise, so that the blood is made subtle.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place a bloodletting on his chest, around the third day, as we mentioned: and try to make him vomit his chest that day from all the animal misfortunes: such as distress, anger, and fear: and from all bodily misfortunes, such as labor, punishment, and excessive sweating, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let his bed be present with the things of which he became accustomed to use through custom among people from aromatics, and perfumes, and dancing and similar things by the amount of possibility.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then the bloodletter should sit on a pillow, which is higher than the pillow for bleeding: afterwards he should draw his arm, and rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he should tie a bandage with a roller, and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the binding be temperate, because when the binding is unequal, or by excess in the binding, then it prevents the course of blood: or in softening, then also it prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the binding, it is necessary to rub the bled person with his hands simultaneously, until the veins are filled and the sensation is lost.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the bloodletter should clean the bled person with a little oil, anciently properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his finger of his left hand on the vein under the place where he wants to bleed, a little: so that the vein does not escape, and it is covered by the blow.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because from the veins is what is found as a fleeing cord at bleeding: and from them is what is full of venosity: and when you place the bled person on it, it contracts under the bleeding, and deceives the bloodletter, and does not open the vein: and if it opens it, it is tight: for that reason therefore it is necessary to strengthen the bloodletter, and to be careful in all these things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then remove the phlebotomist.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If therefore a vein is opened from one wound, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat that wound another under that place slightly, or above it with haste: if the location does not become an abscess.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	But if it becomes an abscess, or the weak man swells, then let him go on the day, or two days: and do not tighten the bandage.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps the abscess will attract hot.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	Nor should he enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then repeat the phlebotomy, if he loves it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	But if the opening is small, or the blood flows slightly: and you fear that not to come out of the blood quantity as you wish: then repeat the phlebotomy in the same hole according to straightness, and add in the operation slightly.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do that with haste, before the location becomes an abscess, for the location becomes an abscess in many men at the small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	But if you see him already swollen, then do not repeat on it at all, for not to excuse anything to you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put on it something from the oil of faeces: because it will relieve the course of the blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than the other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the oil of faeces in all your phlebotomies, where the phlebotomist veins at the prohibition of the course of the blood: and they make it tyriaca alfarach, and sagzenea, when it is put on one of them over the location.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For the blood thins and dissolves, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	But if an abscess happens in the location of phlebotomy great, for often it happens, especially to him who is not phlebotomized except that vein, or is a small opening of the vein, then hasten and put on the location sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly: and tighten it at one hour: because it will dissolve.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	You should perform this procedure after the blood has stopped flowing from the same vein or another one, with its own completeness.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If there remains any discoloration or yellowness in the place after several days, it does not harm to apply something on top of it, such as a solution of aloe, myrrh, or some mint juice, that is, calamint or something similar.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	Frequently, abscesses and swellings occur after bloodletting from the basilica vein.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	Therefore, place your hand on it, and if you find softness at the compression of your hand, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, apply something on top of it as we mentioned earlier.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood may flow from the artery through it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make an ointment with that which has stoptic properties, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary to draw blood from every man according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears by the color of the wine on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it go out until it turns red: and similarly if you see it thick, then let it go out until it becomes thin: and similarly if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be removed.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be increased, and he be a side phlebotomist: and in him who is weak, let the opposite be the case.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary to draw it out at regular intervals, and that there be a narrow opening: and better what is administered in the bloodletting of the vein is that it be a transverse section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	This method of bloodletting is beneficial for stopping blood flow and preventing nerve cuts, and it is more praiseworthy and safer than bloodletting through width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	For those who are accustomed to reaching the phlebotomist with syncope, it is necessary for them to eat a little bread soaked in water with pomegranate juice: or seeded barley, if he is hot; and then draw out three times, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if he is of a cold constitution, then he should take before bloodletting bread soaked in syrup of honeydew, or in aromatic syrup with species, or in fragrant aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncope occurs during bloodletting, and this is the cause of much blood loss, then it is necessary for him to drink water of flesh and aromatic syrup: and to use aromatics with algaia, and to bandage his chest with it: and to use the other things that we mentioned in division on syncope from evacuation in the chapter.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But whoever wants to end his arm and solve his blood second: it is necessary for him whose bloodletting is for much evacuation, and its virtue is weak, that he solves the blood gradually by the amount of virtue in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But whoever wants to end his arm and solve his blood second, and his body is strong: then he should do this after seven hours, or nine from his first bloodletting.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which he leans: it is necessary for him to end in the second day, or in the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	If the body in which there is much blood that is already heated and sharpened, and causes fever, it is necessary to let out a large amount of blood from it in one flow, and to remove a great quantity from it, and to enlarge the opening until it reaches the veins: after you have preserved all the conditions of phlebotomy, and so that your hand is placed on the wound while the blood is flowing, so that death does not occur in place of the veins.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For indeed it often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and through negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you wish to solve the arm, and to solve the blood afterward, when already the opening of the vein is closed, and difficult exit of the blood is made, that it be prematurely placed on top of it with force, and cured extended quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	For that is a great evil, indeed let it go, until the second bleeding.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomy that has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place on it something dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place on it something from the Tyrian alfarsch, or sagazenea, and place it with gentle compression, until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if indeed the vein has already boiled, then let it go, and do not press it until the abscess is settled.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	But if necessity provokes to solve the blood afterward, and there is no excuse, then either with phlebotomy on that place, or in the arm another in another vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the cord of the arm is bled at the place of the Fusca and the Basilica, since they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	The quality of this bloodletting is that the sick person should put their hand into warm water until it reddens, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is tied over it with a bandage of moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the bloodletting is done according to the transversal direction gradually, not too widely, and not along the length: and let it be a wide opening, and let your bloodletting be on the joint of the hand for a short time.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the outlet of the blood is forbidden, then repeat putting the hand into warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you fulfill your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you are in the days of summer, then you will be excused from repeating putting the hand into warm water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	Indeed, the most is placed on the course of the blood in warm water in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this vein's bloodletting is safer than all other veins, because there is no tender or nerve under it.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The bloodletting of the Saloetel hand's right, is relieving liver ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of this bloodletting is that you tie the hand with a bandage or with your hand after you put it into warm water until the vein is punctured, and the sensation is very clear.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then the bloodletting by transversing.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you puncture it completely, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve, do not put your last hand with the bloodletting.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it are the nerves of the fingers bare from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat putting the hand into warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein and be prevented from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	Therefore, when you have drawn out the necessary amount of blood, then place oil and salt on the vein: so that it does not harden quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, you should do with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	However, the remedy for that phlebotomy from the left hand is: because it is conducive to splenic discomforts: and similarly do in its phlebotomy, as you did in the second one, evenly.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	However, the remedy for that phlebotomy from the saphenous veins is: for discomforts that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine discomforts, retention of menstruation, kidney weaknesses, and old ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar discomforts.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of that phlebotomy is: for the infirm to put his foot in hot water: and make friction on him until the veins are full: and tie above the joint of the foot with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the veins indeed are at the heel, appearing towards the big toe: and they branch from there into many branches of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, bleeding from that larger branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregation: because it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you bleed from the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your bleeding where the vein from transudation, as if you wish to pierce it: and let the bleeding be Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	If however the outlet of the blood is prohibited, then repeat the stamping of his foot in warm water: and let the blood flow into it, until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	But if the phlebotomist errs in the first vein, then repeat the phlebotomy to the upper part, for this place is safe, and you should not fear harm from it when you cut the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And likewise with the other Saphena of the foot equally.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But the veins of the Sciatica are, as we have said, located at the heel on the silvery side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the relief of this phlebotomy is, to the pain of the heel, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of this phlebotomy is, that the sick person should enter a hot bath quickly, and tighten his leg from the side of the heel up to above the heel with four fingers, with a thin long needle: for it does not appear otherwise than because of this.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When therefore it appears, then perform the phlebotomy according to whatever skill is possible for you, or by transversion: and it is better, either to cut it with an incision, or to separate it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For this place is safer, and it is hidden in many people greatly.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	But if you do not find it, and it does not appear at all to the sense: then perform phlebotomy some branch of it, and that is the one which appears in the back of the foot, and towards the auricular: and beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow out in the amount that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then dissolve the bandage, and place the skin on the place of the phlebotomy, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	This is easily healed.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	Of Ventilation and its Quality
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter 98
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventilation is made from horns, air, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	Indeed, ventilation is made in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	With incision and extraction of blood: and the other is ventilation without incision.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation that is without incision is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For indeed, it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And ventilation that is administered with incision and extraction of blood are fourteen locations of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is, Ventilation of the Almonds, and is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and is in the middle of the neck: and ventilation of the Alhagdahim, and are two layers of the neck from two parts at once: and ventilation of the mouth, and is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and ventilation of the two spoons: and ventilation of the Alachosos on the end of the tail: and ventilation of the two foci, and are in the middle of the two arms: and ventilation of the two legs: and ventilation of the two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And ventilation indeed does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore its virtue does not fall out of them, as is the case with its effect from phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	Nor is it necessary that ventilation be administered with fire or without fire in any ailments that arise from overfullness until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	But if necessity provokes ventilation from ailment or for custom, we administer it in every hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and at whatever time it is.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	Because there are men who, when the blood multiplies within them, until they need its extraction through ventilation, find a swelling and an ulcer on their head, and they heal it.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them is one who finds a swelling and redness on their face, on their head, and on their neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them is one who finds itching on their face, and on their forehead, and darkness, and dimness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them is one who itches the place of their ventilation.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them is one whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them is one who finds the taste of blood in their mouth: or their tongue swells and they vomit blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them is one whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them is one who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and dead people, and wounds, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	Therefore, when we see something from them, and if it is truly in the third day of the month: we command then for ventilation to be done, after two or three hours have passed since sunset.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	However, the remedy for ventilation of the neck is: because it brings about heaviness in the head, and what is poured out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	However, it should be after the evacuation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is indeed ventilation in the place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed to use it for those who are of cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings about great harm to them.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore, it is not allowed for the elderly, and in whose head there are cold pains.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	Whoever becomes accustomed to it develops a habit of it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore you should command the Windblower to lay his hand briefly on the lower parts, fearing the generation of habit.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosatio or Alkehel is a place for phlebotomy of the Fusco and Basilic veins, and for that reason it helps with asthma, constriction of breathing, splitting of instruments of breathing, cough, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it should be applied briefly to the Windblower Alkehel, because if it is placed below, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosatio alhagdahim actually helps with accidental headaches, and obtalmias, and hemigraneas, and perforation, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is a place for phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should command the Windblower not to press his hand with scarification: so that he does not cut the artery, and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Ventosatio however under the chin helps with alcolae in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar things from ailments that are in the mouth: and it is a place for phlebotomy of the alieherich veins, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Ventosatio however of the spoons helps with alchafacham which is caused by repletion and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Ventosatio however of the interior parts of two focilium helps with the onset of phlebotomy of three veins, Basilic, Fusco, and Cephalic: because it draws blood from all the small veins that are in the flesh: and those small veins draw blood from other grosser veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you should instruct the incisor to not proceed too much in scarification, as the area is exposed to flesh and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	However, the ventouse that is used on a lancet, applies to hemorrhoids of the anus and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you should instruct the incisor to be a large ventouse and made of air, as the area requires strong suction and perhaps delicate ventouses are broken: and it will be scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	However, ventouses of the thighs diminish manifestly: as they attract blood from the whole body and apply to old pains in the kidneys, womb, and bladder: provoke menstruation, and apply to bothor and ademenul: and stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenar veins and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope to occur in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the benefit of ventouses of alhorcobeni is close to the benefit of ventouses of two thighs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of ventouses is that you should place a ventouse in the first empty space and suck with tempered suction: and do not prolong the position of ventouses but place them quickly and remove them quickly, so that the humors come to the area evenly: and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the area already red and inflated, and the appearance of blood redness: then therefore scarify and repeat suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the positioning of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For who is from men is of delicate flesh, rarely of pork, it is necessary that you scarify him once, not more: so that the area does not hurt.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And command the Ventosator to enlarge the incision and make it a bit deeper: and regulate the suction in ease, speed, and motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a lot of blood, then it is necessary to make two incisions.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In the first incision, the path for the thinning and watering of the blood is opened, and in the second incision, the path for the precise extraction of thick blood is prepared.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If indeed the blood is very foul, then a third incision should be made: to reach the end.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And finally, when we want to extract the blood gradually or a little at a time, one incision is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want to extract the blood in large amounts, then we make many incisions.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure the blood to be thick, then it is necessary to make a deep incision: and the limit of equality in the incision is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which must be administered from oils at the position of the Ventosators, and what should the ventosator beware of.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case where the skin is thick, hard, dark, and the pores are narrow, it is necessary to anoint the places of the Ventosators with oils that are open, softening, and resolving: if it is in the time of summer, as is the oil of alkermes, or the oil of violence, or the oil of sweet almonds, or the oil of cucumber seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of camomile, or sarbatin: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If indeed the excess is thick and cold, then the oil should be myrrh oil, or oil of balsam, or white oil, or oil of wormwood: and their likes.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If indeed the pores are wide and of tender flesh, then it is necessary to prohibit the use of oil, and it is necessary for them to wash the locations of the pores after ventosation with rosewater, or with cold water, or with water of solace, or with water of cucumber, or with water of purslane: and their likes.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is much moisture, he should wash the pores with vinegar, or with water of myrtle and sumach: and their likes.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	But he whose excesses are thick, he should wash his pores with old wine, or with water of sambucus, or with the decoction of wormwood, or with chamomile: and their likes.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to avoid ventosation in the bath, or at the edge of the bath, indeed it is necessary to administer after exiting the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not necessary for someone to sleep after ventosation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that one should be regulated with before ventosation, or bleeding?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And then, after that, you should first consider: if the one who has been ventosated or bled is choleric, and they have sharpness and inflammation on their blood: then it is necessary for him to receive cooling things, such as pomegranate museum: and also every evening with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and julep: and their likes.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And he should put his food, chickens, and meat of sekebiget, and foods preserved with aspresta: and their likes.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if its constitution is cold, it is necessary for it to drink a syrup made from honey, or almonds, or seacanibin made from seeds: and it should drink an aromatic wine, which is between old and new: and it is advised to use little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And let its food be chickens, and honeywine: and sparrows, that is, small birds: and it will eat the young of doves.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that its drink on the days of ventilation and phlebotomy be more than its food: and it is necessary to give in the drink to certain men in hours tyrian alfaroch, or a medicine made from musk, that is, musk, or aleselithe before ventilation: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal limbs are strengthened, and the blood is thinned.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not necessary for them to drink hot water.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	¶ On Venting without Scarring
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Venting without Scarring, however, are those that are placed on the side, and spleen, and podagra, and on the belly, umbilicum, and the locations of the kidneys, and the hips: because these limbs do not suffer scarring on them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And nothing is sought through them, except for the attraction of blood from a limb to a limb: as we place Venting on the breasts in illness of bloody discharge from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them to dissolve from the limb cold ventilation that has been frozen in the limb: as we place Venting on the belly, and umbilicum.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it does indeed rarefy the limb, and warms it, and removes pain because it has dissolved that ventilation.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Even a bandage is placed on the kidneys when it occurs there swelling, or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For its own sake of attraction perhaps opens swelling, or removes the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And similarly it does when it is placed on the spleen, and the spleen to be rubbed in both of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these empty ventosities are administered with section alone.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleurisy: and that is, to fill the ventosity, and it is great, hot water alone, or water in which cooked are herbs that agree.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	FORM OF VENTOSIITY ADMINISTERED WITH FIRE.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	LET THE WIDTH OF ITS MOUTH BE TWO OPENED FINGERWIDTHS, ACCORDING TO WHAT WE FORMED: AND LET ITS QUANTITY IN DEEP BE HALF A PALM: AND LET IT BE IN SIDE OF IT IN PLACE WHICH IS AROUND MEDIUM OF IT, A SMALL HOLE, ACCORDING TO QUANTITY THAT ENTERS ITSELF ACUS: MAKE FROM AIR SIMULTANEOUSLY, OR YELLOW, MARGIN OF ROUGH, LENGTHENED, EQUAL, WASHED: THAT NOT HURT MEMBER AT ITS POSITION ON IT: AND LET BE IN MIDDLE OF IT TRANSVERSE STICK FROM AIR, OR IRON, WHERE PLACE IS CANDELA WITH FIRE.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	AND NOW THIS VENTOSIITY IS MADE GREAT, GREATER THAN WE TOLD, AND LITTLE LESS THAT ONE, ACCORDING TO ITS AILMENT AND AGE WHO USES.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	FOR VENTOSIITIES OF BOYS, AND WEAKENED ARE OTHERS, THAN VENTOSIITIES OF MEN, AND ROUGH BODIES.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	BUT THE QUALITY OF PLACING THIS VENTOSIITY WITH FIRE ON MEMBER IS, THAT ACCEND LICINIUM WITH FIRE FROM LINEN DECENTLY, OR SMALL CANDLE FROM CLAY: AND PUT IT OVER MIDDLE OF TRANSVERSE STICK WHICH IS IN MIDDLE OF VENTOSIITY: THAT BE ACCENSED FIRE ABOUT LOWER PART OF VENTOSIITY, THAT NOT BURN BODY WEAK.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the limb: and let the finger be on the hole that I mentioned, until when we grasp the puffy part: while we lack, we remove the finger, and the steam comes out through that hole, and the puffy part is dissolved immediately.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then apply the lime according to its usual method, and repeat it if you lack that.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the puffy part that is administered in the pain of pleurisy with water, it is not a knife that passes through, nor a hole: and it is not administered, unless because the water is filled, and it is placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this puffy part, the greater it is, so that it can hold much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ On the suspension of Sanguisugarum.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguisugarum are not administered in many places, unless in those limbs in which the position of the puffy parts is not possible, due to their size, such as the lip, and the jaw, and the like.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or in a limb stripped of flesh, such as the finger, and the nose, and the like.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that from the puffy parts that are in sweet waters, clean from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are released during the day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and there remains nothing in their stomach.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is purged in the first place with phlebotomy, and with puffy parts.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then clean the limb of the sick person, until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then they are placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When therefore they are filled, and fall, and it is possible to suck the place with puffy parts, then it is more final in the cure: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then, with much water, it is rubbed and squeezed out.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of the blood is prolonged after the amputation of the Sanguisugar, and there is dripping: then pour cold linen cloth into water and place it above, until the dripping is removed.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood multiplies, then powder is sprinkled on top of it, such as Zigi crushed, or galbanum, and similar things from stoptics: until the blood is removed.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they are placed on the place of the cut open beans: and they are let go, until the beans stick in the place, because the blood is removed.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if it is necessary to repeat the amputation of the Sanguisugar, when it is possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if the Sanguisugar are prevented from hanging, then the place is cleaned with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or a plug is placed in the places, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed, because they themselves when they feel something from the blood, stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When therefore you want them to fall, powder is sprinkled on top of them something from crushed aloe, or salt, or ashes: and they fall immediately.

Caput I.	Chapter I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know, O sons, that fools of doctors and the common people, and those who have never examined an ancient book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	For this reason, this method is lacking among our earthly sciences.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never used it well at all, and I did not obtain from it that which I have obtained except for the length of reading ancient books, and the study beyond understanding them, until I extracted knowledge of it from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I adhered to experiment and study throughout the course of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And now I have described to you from that in this Chapter all that contains my knowledge: and over which my experiment passed, after I had abbreviated it for you, and released it from the occupation of length, and abbreviated it at the end of abbreviation, and showed it at the end of declination: and I formed in it many forms from the forms of instruments which are administered in it, since it is from the addition of declination, as I did in two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summaries and collections from the fact of the breaking of bones, from those of which previous mention is necessary before we begin to recall the memory of the limbs of the broken and various, if each one.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary for us to say in the prologue of this Chapter, summaries of speech and chapters, concerning which understanding is required by the first craftsman at the station of their truth: namely that you, and those who are prompt, know or learn this noble art, and others from us.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, therefore, that when it happens to someone a fracture or dislocation or twist or accident: then one must hurry in the first place to bleed him and to resolve him himself, or both at once: unless something prevents, such as weakness of strength: or he is one to whom something happens from those boys, or old men decrepit: or it is a time of very great heat, or very great cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, consisting of cool herbs, and meat of birds and lambs: and prohibit wine, and coarse meat, and filling up with food and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until when he is secure from the abscess hot, and does not fear the outflow of matter to the member: then the sick person should return to his first diet with which he was accustomed to his custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	Therefore when he begins to restore his broken jaw, then the sick person should be fed with nutritious food, much, coarse, heavy, in which there is viscosity: such as made from cooked wheat with water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and bellies of animals, and eggs, and fresh fish: and thick wine, and similar to them.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For this diet makes the healing of the broken jaw faster and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you should know that when bones are broken in men who are in their first old age, and the decrepit, it is not possible for them to be continued and consolidated according to their natural way always, because of the dryness of their members: and they are consolidated and continued what is from them in the end of lenity, as the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However nature connects something similar to glue on the broken jaw from every part, in which there is thickness, so that it sticks and binds it, until they are continued together, and tied together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was in the first place, until something does not prohibit it from its operations: and for this reason it is necessary, that you put food of the sick person, in which there is heaviness, and viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the appearance of fractures varies according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the thigh is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the ribs is different from a fracture of the spine, and similarly all other limbs differ one from another, and I come with remembrance of all kinds of fractures exposed in their respective chapters distinct from one another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	The appearance of fractures also varies within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it is broken in an arc shape, besides what happens to it in the stars.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it is broken along the length of the bone, and its fractures are like stars and additions proceeding, as they are in a reed when it is fitted with a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption at the head, and there is a small fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And there is a proper skill or instrument for every kind of fracture, according to which the remembrance of it will come, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from the fact that a fracture of a bone is known, there is its curvature and its prominence, and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when you grasp it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When therefore there is no curvature appearing in its place, nor sound when you touch the bone with agitation, and you do not find a great weak pain, then it is not a fracture, but possible that there is a curvature or small fracture. Therefore, you should not move it with your hand and compress it at all, indeed put on it from medicines of which the remembrance comes after the moment that suits its place: then it is bound tightly with a thin bandage.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the wound is incised, it is divided into two parts, besides which certain signs may occur in it; however, all part of it should be removed: then you must begin to correct it from your own hour, equalizing it before it becomes hot and inflamed.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if an inflammation occurs in it, then leave it for several days until the inflammation subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then equalize it according to any possible manner from lenity and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And know that the restoration of it and its equalization is easier than bone, in which certain signs may occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then bind it, according to what will come to your memory of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if the signs are in bone, then extension of this broken member from two parts is necessary, if the hand is, or the foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position should be where you place the member on an equal place, according to its natural shape, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then try to make those additions with all skill, and in any manner you can in their places: and beware according to your strength, that pain or injury does not occur from your operation, and try according to your strength, to apply one of two bones with its joint, according to better shapes.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And at that hour, you must try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	But if you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it by the quantity of your skill.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And beware of violent extension and strong compression, as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For many often occur as a result of their operation, an abscess causing heat, or contraction in a limb: as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then after the equation, and a proper operation, and the contraction of that limb, and quietness, and tranquility: and advise the sick one over it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make him take care, not to move himself at his own watchful hours, and during his sleep, and his awakening, and his agitation, and his excretion, and all his movements with his last power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And that he may take care, not to be in a position of the limb which follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	Which is, because when he feels pain in the position of the limb, or injury: then it is necessary to change him to a different position from that with which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And take care with him, that his position be that one equal, straight: so that no curvature may occur in the limb when restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the contraction of the broken limb is, as I tell.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Know that limbs broken vary in their size, and their magnitude, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Which therefore from them are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the phalanx, and similar to them, then it is necessary to be a covering of soft cloth, fine.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	Which however from them are large, such as the hip, and the leg, then it is necessary to be a covering of wide, hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the broad ligament connects the large limb, and binds it from all parts of the contraction equal, so that it does not enter it spot.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then after your evacuation, begin to place the suitable liniment on it, in soft wool on the place of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to wrap the ligament over the place of the fracture with three or four folds, according to what the member requires: and press your hand slightly against the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then go with him to the upper part from the place of the fracture, and press less than the pressure you used to press the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself with the fold from the place of the fracture slightly, and soften the pressure gradually until you take a large piece from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another clean piece of cloth and wrap it again over the place of the fracture with folds.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Afterwards go with the fold to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your operation should be in the pressure of the fold and its softening, as we said in the first fold above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the folds a soft wool or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture will be equal if there is crookedness in it: and if not, you will not put anything on it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap another clean piece of cloth over it.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Afterwards balance the well-made small stars on top of the folds immediately, if there is no inflation in the place, nor hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	But if there is inflation or abscess in it, then place on top of it what sits that abscess and removes the inflation: and let it be left for several days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then press the stars on top of it then.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stars should be made from the middle of a wide cane, smoothed, wisely formed: or from the wood from which cribbas are made, that is made from pine, or gerard, that is, branches of palm, or calingi: and the size of all the stars should be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it is necessary that the nipple placed on the incision should be slightly larger and wider than the other nipples, and its length should be according to the size and strength of the limb.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then tie another thread on top of the nipple, according to the first tightness.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie it with threads from above, as we mentioned about the tightness, and it is that your tightness should be longer over the fracture site, and the farther it is from the fracture, the looser the tightness.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it is necessary that the threads should be of medium thickness and softness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as I saw from the operations of foolish people who used twisted linen threads, it is a great mistake, because the tightness falls away from them in quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads do not hold again, because you will not catch with the tightness that which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not necessary that there should be less than a finger's width between the nipples.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	If the weak person is harmed by the ends of the nipples after the tightness in healthy places, then place under them a soft wool or carminative wool until nothing is harmed from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when there is a fracture with a wound, and disruption in the skin occurs, I will come again with a remembrance of it in the chapter according to its singularity.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be tied with nipples from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb when it is large, should not have nipples placed on top of it, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your safety from the event of hot abscesses.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	This is the method of applying plasters that the ancients used for healing fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common method of applying a plaster for healing fractures, suitable for many body types, especially women and children, as it is made from a material that does not burn or freeze.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is made from the dust of a millstone, which is the fine powder that clings to the walls of the millstone near the moving millstone. You should make it as it is, except for adding some crumbs and the white of an egg. Then place the mixture on the injured area, not too thick or too thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use this plaster.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of applying a plaster for healing fractures, dislocations, and twists.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe the following ingredients and grind them: myrrh, laudanum, acacia, enulae, and mugath. Then add equal parts of water and alethil, and grind and mix everything together with alethil water, or with the white of an egg if the patient's body type is weak and prone to heat.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	This plaster has a good composition and heals broken bones quickly and is suitable for many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of applying a plaster that also helps with fractures and twists.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe the following ingredients and grind them thoroughly: mugath, laudanum, white aloes, myrrh, acacia, and Armenian powder. Then grind and mix everything together with water or the white of an egg, and administer it.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	This method of applying a plaster is used for joining bones that have been separated from their original positions, and it soothes the pain caused by the separation of bones, as well as the cut or fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	The wool is cut, and immersed in vinegar and heated oil, and then placed on a surface.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	However, this plaster does not have the power of restoration, but it is good for sedating hot abscesses and expelling pain appropriately.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The method of the plaster that restores a broken jaw.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take the leaves of a silent fig and the leaves of a wild papyrus, and grind all of them, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The method of the shortened plaster, applied for the restoration of a broken bone: and when you want the resolution of the remaining abscess.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of tall althea, and chamomile, and the flowers of wolfberry, and the flour of herb, one equal part of each: grind all of them, and make it into a plaster with wine, if there is no heated limb.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	But if indeed it is heated, then make it into a plaster with water of coriander, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Another method of the plaster for stronger resolution than this first one, when an hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of tall althea, and the seeds of linseed, and balm, and melilot, and sage, and the flowers of wolfberry, and chamomile, one equal part of each: grind all of them, and make it into a plaster with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All of that according to the heat of the limb, and the quietness of its warmth.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration, unless it is a bandage made of clay and oil: nothing else: and he said that it should be a medium between thickness and thinness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	According to Galen, it is advisable to place on a broken limb during its restoration those things in which there is a loss of heat, such as myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and similar substances from among those we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The method of making a plaster that promotes healing and relieves pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for making a plaster using equal parts of lupine and chickpea flour, human hair from the incisors, or bird feathers, and salt: grind them together, sieve them, and make a plaster from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the amount of plaster that should be used is such that it can remain on the bandage without causing pain or itching to the patient, and without moving the broken bone from its place: if this does not happen, do not remove the bandage for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If, however, it happens that he has severe itching or pain, or inflammation: then hurry and dissolve the bandage in the hour, and remove the plaster from him: and take a soft cloth or a marine sponge, wet and warm, and dip it in warm water, and wash that place with it until the itching stops and the pain subsides.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on it a piece of dry wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil: and bandage it overnight, until you are sure that there is no hot abscess, and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeat this tightly and with a small amount of plaster: and do not bandage it with your first tightness and thin strips until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, inflammation, and all other symptoms have disappeared completely, and you need plaster and bandage, then repeat it as you did at first, evenly.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If something does not happen to a member within the things we mentioned, then you should not remove it unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when it is released after twenty days, according to what appears to you from the removal of the member, as we said, until when the fracture sticks and the coagulation of flesh approaches over it: also add then in the constriction more than your first constriction: and also add in the thickening of the food for the weak, according to what preceded the remembrance of it.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see the place of the fracture already dried up and thinned out more than it should be: then you know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore apply it with warm water at every place where you are removing it, and let it be in all three days, and relieve the constriction a little.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore through this operation nourishment reaches the member, and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the foolish restorers do from the fracture of the member, when it is not restored in the first place according to what it should be, and is restored according to its twist: is an error from their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, they would have said that in their books, and operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any trace of them at all in that: and it is better that it not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	¶ On the making of an accidental wound on the head.
Caput III.	Chapter 3.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are diverse, and their forms are many: and their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For from a fracture is that which is made by impact with a knife: and the impact removes the whole bone until it reaches the siphac, which is under the bone, just as it does in wood: and because of this this species of fracture is called Axial.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	If the knife cuts into a bone and cuts its surface, but does not penetrate to its deepest part, this is called a "Kalaan" fracture, which means an absolute fracture.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there are two types of wounds from fractures, either major or minor.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	From a fracture, there is a type of injury called "contrition" or "attrition," and its cause is being struck by a stone, falling on a stone, or something similar.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	This type of fracture is also "penetrating," which approaches the periosteum, which is under the bone, or is on the surface of the bone: and this wound of these two types of fractures is also either minor or major.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	From a fracture, there is also a type of injury that is hidden within the bone in its fineness of hair-like structure: and it is a small fissure, and because of this, this type of fracture is called "Capillary.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	From these, there is also a type of fracture that occurs by chance, or by being struck by a stone, and similar things that cause the lamina of the bone to enter its interior, and a depression is formed in that place, as happens to copper pots when they are struck, and part of them enters their interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	This happens most frequently in the heads of moist bones, such as the heads of children's bones.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	All these types of fractures have separate signs of displacement, and I will return with a reminder of all of them in their place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	We recognize all these types of fractures by examining them and inquiring about them, and removing the corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The "Capillary" type of fracture is recognized by this, that it is scraped over the bone, and cleaned, and smeared with caustic on top of it, for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of fractures, first consider the accidents of the infirm person: then, if you see from these accidents that it indicates a clear meaning above fear, such as vomiting of cholera, extension, loss of understanding, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, and egression of the eyes, and redness of them, and similar things to these from the accidents in many arrangements, certainly not healed: and if you see accidents that do not frighten you, and hope for salvation, then begin his cure.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if he comes to you wounded in the first place when he is wounded: and this is in winter days, then it is necessary for you to strive in the removal of the bone before the fourteenth day according to every arrangement.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary for you to hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone from the cloth rots, and those accidents happen that we have mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	That is, if the fracture of the bone has already reached the cloth touching the brain, and it is small, and attracted: then it is necessary for you to cut off the part that is broken, and worn away, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And it is, to scrape the head of the wounded one: and to uncover the bone as much as possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the infirm.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	That is, if it happens to you at the detection of the bone bleeding blood, or hot abscess: then place it with what is necessary for it.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is, to fill the place with soaked cloths in wine, and rose oil: and make the wound rest, until the abscess sets, and you are secure from bleeding blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the treatment of the bone and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	One method indeed is to cut the bone with a sharp-edged incisor: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Another method is to administer another incisor after the first one, a bit wider: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also administer another incisor even wider than the second.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second method is to have a number of different incisors with you, some of which are wider in certain places, and some of which are shorter in certain places: and they should be sharp at the ends of their teeth, and made of iron or bone: and use ease in striking on the incisor, so that it does not shake the head, and does not hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If however the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary to make holes around it before you administer incisors, with drills which are called Terebra not penetrating deeply: and they are not so called unless because they do not pass through the end of the fleshy part to that which is after it: therefore, because the Terebro is a round end above it, which is under the sharp head, similar to the edge, and a small circle prevents sinking and passing through the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	And it is fitting for you to take from these drills a number of them, each of which fits the thickness of the bone, until you have all the drills present with you: whose sharp end in length and breadth should be according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of three kinds of drills, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling around the broken bone is: to place the drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then exchange the broach to another location, and place it between all the holes according to the thickness of the radius, or approximately that.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the incisors what is between all the holes from the bone: and make it as thin as possible above that from the fine edge, as we said, until you remove the roots of the bone, or by your hand, or with some other instruments which you prepared for that: such as thin scissors and forceps.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary to guard against the pits in every precaution, lest the broach or incisors touch anything from them.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When therefore you are drilling around the bone and it has been separated from the pits, if it is continuous with it, and you have removed it, it is necessary to scrape, and make equal the end of it that remains in the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	But it must be thinner and more delicate than other incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If there remains anything small from the bones and shavings: then take them with ease, with that which is at hand from your instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the wound after that with liniments, and ointments which we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another method of operation is easy, completely far from fear: which he said Galen, and praised it greatly: and this is his word.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary for you in the first place to begin to uncover a part of the bone from the place where the fracture is more and clearer: until when you have uncovered that part, and placed the end of this lenticular incisor under it, whose this is the form.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part does not cut anything: and the sharp part on both sides of it wandering in its length, as you see: so that the lenticular part is hanging over the pits, with its face facing the sharp part in the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike with a small mallet on one side of the Incisorium until you have cut through the entire bone with ease, as it is rolled back. And be secure from the cloth that nothing accidental may happen to it, which you fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not more foolish than men and more ignorant of it, nor were he sleeping, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in certain places, he would cut it off from him with the extremity of the lens-shaped incisor, and free it from him with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is cut off from the bone is its face, and there remains in it roughness and subtle thorns: then it is necessary to scrape away that roughness, and uproot those thorns with fine rasps of which you have prepared a variety of sizes, so that it may be possible for you to administer in every suitable place more and better of them, and more and better of their own kind, according to what leads you to the operation, and the fractured bone, and its shape.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And it is necessary for you to administer in your own ratio, by which in the first place you cut the bone, more widely of those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it with finer ones.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease to do that according to its continuity, until you reach administering thinner and more subtle of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In each of the remaining cracks, wounds, and fine fractures, it is necessary for you to administer care, according to what leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And there is a matter which does not remain hidden on all, in this art, and it has stood above that which we wrote and showed in the case of great fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	If, however, the bandage is detected and retained when removing the bone: then it is necessary for you to take a cloth of linen, according to the size of the wound, and dip it in rose oil, and place it on top of the wound opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another cloth doubled or tripled, and dip it in wine and rose oil, and place it on top of the first cloth: and make it as light as possible on top of it, so that it does not weigh heavily.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer the wide bandage above it: and do not tie it, unless by the amount that holds the wound only: and leave it with this care on one day or two days, until you are sure of no hot abscess.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer the following remedies with which there is excessive dryness: such as lily roots, and herb flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar to them: and it is that you make from these remedies a powder, which will be sprinkled on the wound as dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And universally administer all the remedy of its property to cleanse and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And beware according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment is clean: neither is there in it grease of ointment, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor dismiss the virus to accumulate in it at all: for when the virus accumulates on the bandage of the brain, it corrupts it, and rots it, and a great evil occurs after that on the weak one: and already it has happened in the head, when it is cleaned by it, especially when its care is neglected, blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider then, if such accidents happen to the weak one as we have said, you know that it is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	If the blackness does not occur except from the medicine that is placed upon it and is in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness, then it is necessary for you to take a part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen cloth with them.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then place it upon the siphac: afterwards, care for it with the species of healing that come together, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ On the Restoration of the Nose when it is Broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not broken except from its two upper parts at once, or one of them, because it is two bones: therefore, since the lower part of it is cartilaginous, it is not broken, and only attrition, twisting, and swelling happen to it.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary for you to insert a small finger into the nostril, and make equal that fracture with your index finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural form: and do this with skill and ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And beware, lest pain occur from your operation upon it.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and does not reach your finger: then it is necessary for you to make equal the end of the radius, where there is a small swelling.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then do the same as that: and hasten with the restoration of it on the first day after the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then on the seventh or tenth day, at the warm baths of pus,
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part: or insert two linen cloths if the fracture is in two parts: and let the swelling be of such quantity that it fills the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	Certain ancient healers said that linseed should be infused in butter and changed every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	However, I do not see that it is necessary to infuse linseed in butter, but rather with lime in the form of powdered millstone.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then dismiss the linseed until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes firm.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the place of linseed in the nose, after it has been covered with a soft cloth: so that it holds the broken nose more firmly and does not prevent the weak one from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	This is not a necessary matter.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do this; and if you wish, make linseed.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If it happens again to the nose while you are operating on the abscess, apply warm plasters of nasal ointment with lime, or with cotton soaked in rose oil, or with a little diaqualon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the abscess does not occur again while you are operating on the hot swelling, then it is necessary to apply plasters of flour of sissam with powdered turpentine and lime in butter.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft cloth on it, and do not bandage the nose at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the bones of the broken nose are crushed or broken into small pieces, then it is necessary to split them and remove them with the instruments that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then sew the cut, and care for it with what heals and consolidates it from suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	But if a wound occurs between the nose and the bone, then it is necessary to care for it with linseed: and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Concerning the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe if the fracture is only deformed and not broken into two pieces, and if it can be treated internally: then the diagnosis is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is in the right jaw, insert the index finger of your left hand into the weak bone: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of your right hand: and push with it the roughness of the fracture from inside to outside with your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and with it make it even.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two pieces, then it is necessary to apply extension from both parts, according to straightness: until it is possible to make an evening.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	But if it has already happened that the teeth are displaced or broken, then tie them with thread made of gold, silver, or wool.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a bandage over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place over it a double layer of cloth, and place on the cloth a large star-shaped piece of skin evenly, in the length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it from above, according to how the ligature is prepared for you and its application fits, until it is not destroyed: and order the weak one to use it with tranquility and quiet: and place its sucking on soft food.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	But if you think that something is already changing the shape in some ways: then hurry, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has been changed from it, and make plasters of it from the flour of the mill, with egg white, or with semolina, after you have removed the bandage: and place a soft cloth over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While the adhesive plaster remains attached to it and the bone's position is not altered, let it go, do not tear it off, until it heals: or bind the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For often this fracture is bound up for three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If however meanwhile an hot abscess occurs, then administer what we said should be often given for its sedatio until that abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if the fracture is with a wound, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	Now the fragment is already separated from the bone, or from the splint: then carefully take out that fragment of the splint with it which suits you in its removal from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	But if however the wound's opening is narrow, then enlarge it with a lancet according to the amount of your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you have removed that splint, and there remains none of it, then close the wound's opening, if it is large: and if not, place on it from the plasters which suit it, and cover it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the Clavicle, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	The clavicle is indeed most often broken from its anterior part on the side of the arm, and its fracture occurs in two ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	For indeed it is broken and separated into two, except that some splints happen to be in it: and it is easier for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, that some happen to be in the bone of the splints: and it is more difficult for its restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, that it is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the fracture is without a wound, is that you make present two assistants, so that one of them holds the instrument following the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make the fracture of your fingers equal, until it becomes its form, according to what is necessary: and there should not be any projection or hollowness in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need more extension, then you should place under the infirm sphere a ball of cloth or wool: and its size should be according to your need: and extend, and raise the hook, and cut the sphere with your hand, until it becomes equal to the fracture, according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot pull the end of the hook to the outside: because it reaches deep: then you should bend the infirm person on their shoulder: and place a pillow medium in size under their arm, and press their arm downwards, until the hook is raised that is in the depth upwards: and then correct the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If however you feel splintering from the hook, and it moves: then you should chip over it, and extract the splintered part with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If however it is stuck in the bone, then use your skill in the incision of it with one of the prepared incisors, after you have placed under the hook the instrument that will hold the splinter: and this is an instrument made of wood, or of iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles a spiral that does not have a hollowness.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to what you need from the size and shape of the bone.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	Its length indeed also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If, however, the disruption of the wound that you cut when extracting the splinter of bone is wide, and you secure yourself from suppuration by heat: then bring together the two lips of the wound with a suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you fear suppuration by heat: then fill the wound with cloth and cotton according to the amount of the wound's cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If, however, suppuration by heat occurs, then pour cloth with rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The bandaging of bone when there is no wound and no cut is, to place on the bone a plaster made from flour of molding with animal glue.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft cloth on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under its tongue, if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take a reed, that is, a stick which the Saracens hold, which is long and large: and its width should be that of one palm or about that.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a doubled cloth on top of the plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a small board from a thin one, whose width is that of three fingers, and in length similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the small board in the place where the reed falls on the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the reed on the fracture as it is rolled, and wrap it around his neck, and under the healthy tongue and under the sick tongue: and reduce it over all parts, and how you see that the bandaging holds the fracture properly: and this is what should not be hidden from you, and all of it, so that the small board is not removed above the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this reason, you should examine the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	When the ligament is softened and you see the star already moving: then correct it and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his chin during his sleep, so that his support can be raised from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the furcula is raised by elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind the arm to his neck: and do not release the ligament if it does not occur in the place of accident from itching, or from abscess, until the twelfth day.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then renew the plaster if you see his face towards it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add in the stricture, and let him go until he is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	And the fracture of the furcula is tightened and strengthened as much as possible in twenty-eight days: and sometimes it happens in some people in less than that.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the Spatula.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	The spatula rarely breaks, and in the wide place of it: and they are not broken from it except its margins.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	When therefore it is broken from that place, and broken in the middle of it, and is not known except by touch: then according to what is the figure of the fracture attempt preparation of it.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to the natural shape in every way by your skill, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then place on the place of dust from the mill with white chalk, and woolen cloth, and put a small pillow on top of doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then place a wide flat dish on top of it according to the quantity of the thin plate, or slightly larger than that.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	Indeed, if there is a hollow in any part of the thin plate under the dish, then fill that hollow with soft cotton until the dish descends evenly.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then tie it up from above with a long rope, with proper tension and strength of the dish, until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the rope every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever the rope becomes soft, tie it again, and if the dish is moved from its place, let the weak side lie on the healthy side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	The thin plate, however, will be restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then untie the rope: and you will be in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union should not be feared nor their dissolution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if a bone fragment proceeds and punctures under the skin: then cut above it, and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what we said about the fracture of the rump from the suppression of abscesses with warm compresses if something happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	Paragraph: On the Restoration of a Fractured Chest.
Caput VIII.	Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The chest sometimes breaks in the middle of it, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	Its extremities are broken and crushed most often due to accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When its middle is broken, which leans to the lower parts, and pain and difficulty in breathing, and cough occur, and perhaps vomit blood, and the hollow in the fractured bone is not hidden from sensation, its restoration is that it should be bent weakly on its back: and place between the thin plates a pillow.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press his shoulders and gather the ribs from both sides with your hands: and thin them out in their plane, as much as possible and as it is suitable, until they return to the shape of the bone, according to what is required.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place a plaster and bandage on him, and place an asterisk above it from a thin board of willow or cherry wood, and similar ones in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then thin out the bandage that is tied over the broken jaw, so that it does not move: and go with the bandage according to its roundness towards the back several times, and tighten it with a proper binding.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if necessity provokes its dissolution at a sore, or corrosion that happens in the place, or pain, or abscess: then hasten, and dissolve it, and remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with the mode of its cure.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see it to that face: and attach it to a bandage, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ On the restoration of the ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter 9.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that the fracture of the ribs does not occur except in places that follow the back and from the ends of them from the front part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And they do not break except for this reason, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the sense with the fingers in examination.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And its restoration is made so that the fracture with the fingers in a possible way, until it is equal to the figure, according to what is required.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply plasters and bind a fractured jaw with splints, if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the interior: then it happens that the patient experiences severe pain and puncture, as that puncture which occurs to him who has pleurisy: because the bone presses the bandage, and also to him there occurs difficulty in breathing, and cough, and vomiting of blood: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients have been skilled in this with many ingenuities: and from them are those who say, that you should place foods of the sick which generate inflammation and diarrhea, so that the belly is inflamed, and stretched, and the fracture is moved towards the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We indeed abhor, that there not be a quick cause to make an abscess hot, if it does not occur.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already occurred, then you add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And some of them said: place it on a wet place, then suck it with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, one should be afraid that the wet place attracts excessive fluids to the spot, because of the disposition of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And some of them said: it is necessary that the spot be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and they place pads between the ribs, until it is filled: so that it may be a bandage equal when you roll it according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then the sick will be cured of pleurisy by food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	But if the sick person is strongly compressed, which he cannot tolerate, and the bone presses the bandage, and wounds with the puncture, and we fear for the sick: then it is necessary, that you cut above the spot, and remove from the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we will place upon these matters an instrument that preserves the tooth, of which mention was previously made: and we will cut through the bone with ease, and we will cut into it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and we will care for it with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If however an abscess occurs meanwhile, then hurry, and pour warm cloths in rose oil, and place it over the place: and let the sick person be cared for with what is fitting for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile also it will be bandaged on the side over which he sleeps, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine in the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed the bones of the neck sometimes suffer a fracture, and rarely wear away: and similarly the spine in the back also.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When therefore it happens to someone, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stupefied, and dead: and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them: and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that he is not healed, and in many cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he moves them, and feels contraction in them with your fingers, and pricking: then know that the neck of the bone is saved, and that the sick person will be healed with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	But if he suffers a similar fracture in the spine, and you wish to know whether he will be healed or not, then consider his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happens in the hands happens to them: and when he lies on his back, wind and excretion come out without his will: and when he is turned on his stomach, excretion comes out without his will: and when he is turned on his back, and wishes to defecate, but cannot: then know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not labor in his care.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If however something does not happen to him from that, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the treatment of what happens from that is, that you try to seek sedatio
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place on that one several times a day until when the boil is sedated: then place on the location one of the strengthening, drying, and binding plasters: and instruct the sick person to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	Nor should he sleep on the side with which he found pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If however something happens at the attrition of the bone sathaiatum, or anything that is already separated from it: then it is necessary, that you separate yourself from the skin, and remove that.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather two wound lips, if it is large, with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that one with some fleshly, from the ointments, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If however the last bone of the tail is broken, and it is the end: then it is necessary, that you insert your left hand's thumb into the anus, and equal the broken bone with your other hand, as possible, and secondarily in equality.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place on it, and remove it: and care for the wound with the healing that preceded, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	¶ On the restoration of the ankle.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of the ankle rarely break.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If however they break, then the fracture of them is not, except comminution in the extremities of them: and they are broken in length, and decline to the interiors: and happens pain in the place, and puncture: and astonishes the leg that breaks.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	The restoration of it is indeed that you extend your hand upon him, until you stand over the fracture, as its figure is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	But if the fracture is only in its extremities, then equal that fracture, according to what is prepared for you from equality, until it resembles its natural figure.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	But if the fracture is in its length, or already inclines to the interiors: then make the sick one lie on his belly, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When therefore you have equalized it, place upon it a plaster: then place upon it a splint from wood, or from skin: and bind with a bandage above which you do not fear the change of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And equal the concavity of them with that which fills it, until it receives the bandage according to equality: and command the sick one, that he lie on his back, or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	But if an abscess hot occurs to him: then cease from the extension of it, and his restoration, until the hot abscess sits: and place upon him that which sits him, according to what preceded, then return to his restoration: and bind him as it ought.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	But if indeed it occurs in the bone shattering, or is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	¶ Of the restoration of the fracture of the humerus.
Caput XII.	Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid is that which is between the elbow and the head of the spoon.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	But if it is broken, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One of which is: that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two ligaments are tied at both ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from an elevated place, and the weak one sits on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm on a piece of wood, until it reaches the titillus, in which the middle is attached to the curved wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then something heavy is hung over him, so that he extends himself towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the doctor balances the fracture with his hands at the same time, until the fracture returns as it should be.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another way is that the weak one lies down on his shoulder: and hangs his hand from his neck with a ligament.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command two assistants, that one of them holds that which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other holds below him, and extends each of them to his part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you want, that the extension be stronger, then tie under the fracture with a ligament, and above it with another ligament: and each of the two assistants extends to his two parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If therefore the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that one ligament be placed under the titillus, and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow: then it is necessary that the ligament be placed on that place, and on the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then balance the fracture with ease without labor, until when the fracture is balanced according to what it should be, and applied with good application: then tie it, if not an abscess of hot water occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	But if indeed an abscess of hot water occurs, then let go the tie until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on top of it succulent wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the abscess calms down: then bind it: and the way to bind it is, such that you place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place a new cloth bandage on top of the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then attach the arm to the support itself, and place her hand open on her shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind it on top of the arm support, so that the arm stands in the position of the stars: if he does not forbid you from him anything, nor anything is changed above you from the broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	But if you fear that something is changed above you from the broken bone, then use the stars: and it is, such that you place on top of the fracture itself the star that is wider and stronger than the other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place between every star width of a finger: and let the length of the stars be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then bind on top of the stars the binding that I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is, such that your binding be over the place of the fracture tighter.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And the more the fracture extends, the less the binding.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If therefore you see the position of the stars and the binding, as we said, at the hour when you restore the member immediately, then do: and if you fear the warm abscess, then release the binding and the stars up to the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the bandage in all three days, so that it does not occur in the place of itching, or inflation, or food is prevented from coming to the member, because of the position of excessive binding.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So, we will correct this entire thing, as we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	If indeed you are of good faith, so that nothing unpleasant happens from it, then do not dissolve the ligature until after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the sick person sleep on his back, and his hand on his belly; and place under his support a stuffed mat filled evenly with wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	And consider at every hour of the night or day, so that the broken member's figure is not dissolved, nor the ligature softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	So, correct this entire thing by your virtue.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place the sick person's food according to the order we prescribed, so that the food is subtle in the first place, until he begins to swallow: then it is necessary to make his food thicker.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of the support and leg is that it should be swallowed in forty days: therefore it is necessary to dissolve, and administer a bath, and treat with ointments that rectify that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is foul and worn: then do not dissolve from it the ligature and stars until fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	¶ On the restoration of the fracture of the Arm.
Caput XIII.	Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called two forearms.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of which is short: and that is the one that follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large, and that is the one that is placed under the small from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps it breaks only the larger forearm, or the smaller: and perhaps they both break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore the smaller forearm is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	When the lower part of the bone is broken, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when two bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	Therefore, if the bone that is broken is slightly above the lower part, then it is appropriate for the physician to use a gentle extension with ease until it matches it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	However, if the bone that is broken is large, then it is necessary to use a stronger traction quite strongly.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary to place the shape of the hand and its extension on the mattress during healing.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers: and the joint below all the fingers, or others, and the weak person sitting squarely on himself, and the mattress in front of him, or directly in front of him, at a height, so that the weak person does not incur labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then the servant should extend the arm from the lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another servant should extend it from above in the same way.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the physician should match the bone until he reduces it to the best possible shape.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are splinters in the bone fracture, then try to reduce all the fragments to their place by your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	However, if it appears in him that the splinter is separate and pierces the skin, and there is no hope of its healing, then cover it over and remove it according to the method we mentioned in those things that were previously mentioned.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	However, if the fracture is with a wound, I have already dealt with that chapter alone, therefore take its healing from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	However, if an abscess with hot pus occurs at the beginning of your healing, then make a linen cloth with a thin layer of rose oil, and white wax, and it should be between thickness and fineness: and bind the cloth over it with a fine traction, until when the abscess is calmed: then remove the wax, and place a prepared plaster made from flour millstone with albumen on it.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place a splint, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in many arrangements: whether the fracture is in one fossa, or in two fossae at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your bandage on the stronger and more powerful part of the fracture, and a little more with the bandage towards the upper part of the fracture, or towards its lower part: or place a softer bandage with the bandage for a while, according to the previous mention of it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let the bandages that are wrapped around the fracture be soft, moist cloths: and not hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread that is used to tie it be a linen thread, of medium thickness between thin and thick, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb: then it is necessary to embrocate the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and let the limb not be constricted until it is quiet, then repeat the bandage.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the bandage has already become soft, and the bone has already been removed, and similar things: then correct all of it by your virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb because of the excess of the bandage, then it is necessary to soften it a little, and let it be loosed for several days until the nourishment reaches it, then bandage it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if nothing of the things we said happens to the sick person, then it is not necessary to loosen it, unless after twenty days, or about these.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then suspend the hand of the sick person around his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let his neck be equal, and guard it by its own strength against jerky movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days, or in thirty-two days, and perhaps in eighty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this is according to the arrangements of the humors and the arrangements of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	§ On the healing of fractures of the hand.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter 14.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that a fracture of the fingers and the knuckles of the hand rarely occurs.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him, unless there is repeated wear.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When therefore a fracture or wear occurs in the toes: then it is necessary for the sick person to sit squarely: and there should be a seat according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on that extended one.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the servant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should equal them until they are joined together in a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage, if there does not occur a hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place a splint above according to the amount of space: and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is towards the lower part around the belly of the foot, then make a similar sphere from the cloth: and order the sick person to cover it with his broken foot: then it is bound with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And the splint should be from the hide, in which there is softness, so that the hide may be applied to the body of the foot: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is to the outside, then it is necessary to place a splint above and another below in the plantar region, and let the hand be open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then apply a bandage as the hand is bent, and extend between the fingers with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a fracture occurs in one of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it will be adjusted according to what is appropriate.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then it will be bandaged with the plantar region: and if it is a deep wound, place a straight splint, small: so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle, and index, and auricular, and annular, then it will be adjusted and bound with the healthy finger that follows it: or all will be bound according to continuity: and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small splint on top of it, as we said in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after the arrangement of abscesses with hot compresses: and place it with what is appropriate, when something occurs from it, according to how its story repeats.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ On the restoration of a fracture of the hip.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks, and is felt, because it turns to the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is made so that the ligament is bound above the fracture, and another ligament under the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person is stretched out on their face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then stretch out all the bandage assistant to their part according to equality: and this, when there is a fracture in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If, however, the fracture is near the root of the hip, then the ligament should be tied to the part of the patella, so that the extension falls upwards: and another ligament should be tied under the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in a similar manner, if the fracture is near the knee, then the ligament near the knee should be tied, so that the extension falls downwards.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should equalize the bone with both of his hands, until he reduces it back to its natural shape: and he should join the bone with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then one should apply a plaster and bandage, unless it does not happen to the member aphtha.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	But if it happens to the member aphtha: then let him leave it for several days, until the abscess becomes warm, then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	The bandage of it should be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to cover over the fracture above with a hard leather, that is, a bandage: and double it twice, or thrice: and there should remain some excess from it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then cover the leg, until it reaches the calcaneus at the root of the buttocks.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long rope between the hip and the leg near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the rope come from the upper part of the two parts.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll up the excess on the leg and hip from the leather.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place above the hip in the place of the fracture some stars, and place one star on the knee joint.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the spaces between the leg and hip with soft cloths, so that the bandage may be equal.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle of the place of the fracture with three turns, or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you lengthen with the ligament from the place of the fracture, your constriction will be less and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then bend it towards the two ends of the thread, which you have inserted between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Therefore tie with both of the three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then go with both ends of the thread downwards, until you reach the heel of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And with both also tie the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the ligament will not be removed from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then let go of the constriction above that, while it remains, so that no corrosion, nor abscess, nor inflation, and similar things to them, will occur in the member.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Then quickly with the solution of it, and correct that which happened from it all, according to what we said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if in the bone there is a piece from the bone which pricks: then it is necessary, if you can, to make it equal.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above it, and remove it: and take care with the one of which its remembrance preceded, until it is healed.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, besides that stars are added to it, as we said in the aid and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of such a fracture, the weak does not experience limping.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides that the other leg is applied to it, then it is necessary that he who owns it will always limp.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is bound in fifty days, or a little is added to it, or a little is subtracted from it: all of this is according to the diversity of the humors, and the other arrangements.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Translation: On the restoration of a broken kneecap.
Caput XVI.	Chapter 16.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	Know that the kneecap rarely breaks, but it often becomes worn out.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed it does break, then only a fissure or a hole will be found in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is with a wound, and without a wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And it is treated with the whole body, with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And its restoration is thus, that it will be made equal to what was broken from its parts with fingers, until it is gathered together and joined together as much as possible according to the equality and facility, and the making.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place a plaster made from semolina or milled grain with egg white on top of it: and place a round button on top of it if you need it: and bind it above with a bandage suitable for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the positions that we have mentioned for other fractures: as boil hot, and similar to it: so, that you place everything with an accident that is suitable for it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Translation: On the restoration of a broken leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the leg bone is two bones, of which one is thick and is called the leg bone: and the other is fine and is called the shinbone.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both of these from the species of fracture that it happens to two bones of the arm: and because of this, its restoration is made, like the restoration of the arm, equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If both bones are broken at once, the leg is turned to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if the fine bone is broken, it turns the leg to the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if the bone is broken roughly, you will find it below: and there are among them what do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply the extension, equality, and ligation of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a foul fracture, having many splinters, then the extension should be less and gentler according to your relief.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg itself is something from the operation on the arm: and it is that when you equalize the stars and complete all your operation, then take two bands made of pinewood, which is used in the construction of sun dials that are placed under the tables: and they are made from the fingers of the palm: and choose from them what has a small thickness, and not from the small ones: and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then roll it up on each cloth with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the leg on one side and the other on the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie two bands in three places from both ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when stricture is prohibited, the leg leans to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And indeed, the cradle will be applied according to the length of the leg, and placed in it, the leg, so that it may keep it from movement.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And indeed, you must do this very much in a fracture when with it is a proper wound.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and study with it with the last effort to avoid suppuration, or swelling, or other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If therefore something happens from those, then apply to it with what is necessary until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Translation: On the Fracture of Bones in the Foot and Toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	Fractures of the heel do not occur completely.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	Fractures of the bones of the foot and toes do occur sometimes, and they also occur infrequently: and they do not occur to them except from wear in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot and you see those bones elevated above each other, then place your weak foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand up and place your foot on that which is elevated from those bones: then press, or step on it: and make it even, until it returns to its places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster and bandage on top: and place under the sole of the foot a small board, which has two flat heads.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then bind it with the foot with a proper binding, after you have rolled it up with cloths and other things that are necessary.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	Therefore when three days or four pass by him, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bones evened, whether they are fractured, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	Therefore the operation in them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	But if some fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them even as I have told you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place a splint on your finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little wider than that: then place under the foot this board which I have told you, and bind it with a proper binding.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	But if that which is broken is from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place on all the finger of its quantity, rolled up in linen: and bind the board in the lower foot: and let it stand on one head of the board outside the sole of the foot, so as to hold well with retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting for you that you not forget, but rather consider all things that I have told you about the other fractures from the accidents that we mentioned: and oppose each accident with what is appropriate.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	On the fracture of the vulva of a woman, and the bone of the beak, and the virgin of a man.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the vulva of a woman is fractured, then make her sit in a square position.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her towards the back part of her own body, and hold her from behind.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill her vulva with cotton, until she fills it: and let it be made into a sphere from that.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then shake the woman, and elevate her back gradually.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that cotton comes out, until it becomes before the vulva like a sphere, and the fractured bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a compress on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When therefore she wants to urinate, remove the cotton with ease, then she urinates: and reduce it back according to the manner in which you introduced it first: then return to her own compress first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do that for seven days, or about, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you want, take a catheter, and tie it over the hole of the bone with a reed, and introduce the catheter entirely into her vulva.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow in the cannula with force, until the bladder is inflated within the vulva, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then it should be filled with cotton, and let her stand for several days, according to what we have told you, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the bone of the beak of a man or woman is fractured, then administer in its restoration, and according to its equality that we have told about in the bone of the anchor.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And the straight is not hidden in these fractures that are close to each other, especially for those who have some study or experience.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book, for the fracture itself indicates to you in many arrangements the straight path in its restoration and its healing: understand therefore.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But in the penis of a man when it is broken, take the neck of a goose and insert the rod into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place a wrapping of cloth over it and wrap it up, and let it be released for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	¶ On the restoration of bone fractures when there is a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	He who has experienced the fracture with the wound, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or the shoulder blade, or a similar one, so that you can act quickly, and perform a bloodletting immediately: if the conditions for bloodletting are confirmed to you, as we have previously mentioned.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound bleeds, then you should act quickly to remove it, so that you sprinkle powdered charcoal on top of it: if you do not have any other present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in that same day: and do not postpone it, unless an abscess does not occur.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if indeed an abscess occurs hot, then let the restoration of it be postponed until the ninth day, until the abscess settles.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you would be causing it to suffer bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If however the fractured bone is prominent above the skin exposed: then you should try to reduce it, and equalize it with your hands with facility and slight extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, you have not prepared an extension for it, and its equality is not achieved by your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And there is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length is a quantity of seven fingers, or eight: and its width is according to the quantity of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from them three, or four, according to the quantity that he needs for that from the treatment in every kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And let it be round: and let there be a small bulkiness on it, so that it does not double up under compression upon it in an hour of the operation: and let it be sharp at its extremities, with a margin on its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above its bulkiness from the middle of it up to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation, it is necessary to place the sharp end of it curved above the prominent extremity of the bone: and push it with it with one force, until when the bone returns and is made equal by some equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore try to make the extremities of the fracture equal again.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its extremities are subtle, and it does not receive the instrument with good reception, then it is necessary, that you cut the extremity of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If indeed you cannot reduce them with the instrument that we have mentioned, then cut it with that which is fitting for it from the knives that we have mentioned: or a saw with one saw in whatever possible way is to you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then plane it which remains in the bone from roughness and small bones.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced, and it finds an infirm person after its reduction suffering from a violent pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Do this then.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you confer a great comfort to the sick, when your restoration is completed which you make of bones.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in astringent wine, black.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And truly if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And you do not place on the wound a poultice, nor anything in which there is oil: so that it does not cause decay and putrefaction in itself.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then administer astellas at the hour of your completion of the restoration of bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the detected wound heal: thus, so that you cut with forceps a hole in the folds according to the amount of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And beware with all caution, so that you do not tie the wound with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times have the foolish physicians done this: and they caused to happen to their sick ones either death, or corrosion, or zuchum, that is, sain.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your binding should be soft, gentle, different from the bindings of the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	But if the wound is evil, or is a great wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have mentioned, and you find pain in the hanging place: then it is not necessary to place on it astellas.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make for them folds from hard cloth in the place of astellas, and tie it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound beginning to generate pus: then take away from above it the cloth which you placed on it with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then administer liniments, and ointments with which from our custom it is to heal wounds: such as tetrapharmacon oil, and similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it is fitting for you to loosen the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day in the morning and evening, until it is healed and becomes healthy.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the limb in such a way that pus flows down from it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	But if many days pass by and the wound does not heal, nor is the pus removed from it, then you will know that there are small bones underneath.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Therefore, it is necessary to examine the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those small bones are separated, remove them, and take them out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And those of them that are not separated, and pierce the limb, and cause pain, try to cut them, and remove them in any way that is possible for you to do so.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	But if a wound becomes infected with pus, or ekileten, that is, estiomenus, or any other sign of corruption and putrefaction, then you must apply to each of them the remedy that is appropriate for it from the cure, whose previous description is in its own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in the place where it is necessary for my discourse to stand, and to which you should direct your present mind when a bone breaks and protrudes from the limb, such as the thigh bone, and the shoulder blade, and similar ones from large bones, it is that you do not assume its attraction, for often death occurs from it, indeed, let it go, until it putsrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then therefore cure the wound, if it seems to you: and otherwise, let it go.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	¶ On the cure of Nodation in the stump of a fractured limb.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This suture is often used for healing a fracture in the hoof.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, this one which is near the joints, and it becomes deformed from its figure of a member.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from performing its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Therefore, consider if the suture is recent: administer in it medicines which have astringency, such as aloe, and frankincense, and myrrh, and sarsaparilla, and acacia, and similar to them.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, you will take some or all of these: and mix them with astringent wine, or with egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the suture in cotton, and tie them over it with a good ligature.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And leave the ligature, but do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then loosen it, and repeat another, until the suture is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or tie over it a leaden strip properly.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead is the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the suture has already turned into stone, and is tight, and urgently requires removal: then cut off the superfluous part from above it, and shave it with some razors, until it is removed: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	§ On the cure when the limb is restored, and remains after that delicate, not according to its natural condition.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of a bone is restored, and the limb remains after that delicate, weak: then it is not made except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	One of which is, the excess of the solution of the ligament and its ligature, not according to what it should be: or because of the superfluity of the bandaging of the ligaments, until the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb: or because of the excess of unnecessary embrocation at an inappropriate time: or because of the lack of blood in the body of the weak person, and its debility.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	The treatment for this is to feed the sick person and make his body tender, until the blood multiplies within him.
Et administra balneum.	And apply a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And bring joy and happiness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place the mustard plaster on his limb: so that the mustard draws nourishment much to him.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And he should frequently apply the ointment with warm water, until the nourishment is cured, and he returns to his natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	On the treatment of broken bones when they are being straightened.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When it happens that a member already restored after its healing is twisted, and the prominence of the bone broken, or the knotting: and it is deformed by this form of the member, nevertheless the member is not prohibited from its natural operation: then it is not necessary to receive the word of him who thinks that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many foolish physicians and restorers who have done this in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And indeed this operation is very reprehensible, leading to death, or great fear, so that indeed it be mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the limping and knotting are recent: then it is necessary to be rubbed with warm water, in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as high hemp, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let an ointment be made for him with a softening plaster, such as diachylon made properly.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let the mucilage of the root of high hemp be taken, and be beaten with chicken fat, or with sesame oil: and it is to be plastered with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or they take ripe figs, and crush them with clay from a dovecote, and similar substances which are called 'diminishing consolidations' in medicine.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And sometimes the contraction is solved with frequent, old-fashioned friction, which is done with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And motion of the member is given to all parts at every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the twisting has already preceded, and it has become strong, and has turned into a stone, and necessity has been provoked for its cure with iron: then it is necessary to follow above it, and to dissolve the continuity of the bone, and to cut off what superfluously arises from the twisting or the bone with delicate knives: and to give ease in that with solicitude and study.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Of speech in dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Therefore it is prohibited from its motion, and the figure of the member is deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes to happen over the weak pains, and violent injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	Therefore when it happens to someone, then it is necessary to hasten to its restoration: nor does it delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it is delayed, the place becomes an abscess, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore it is not necessary, that it be moved, nor stretched in the hour of its abscess.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Because often it causes to happen spasms, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when it happens, then it is necessary, that you hasten to the bloodletting of the weak.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is dismissed, until the abscess rests.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the affected body part should be rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it should be returned with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And all the body parts should be treated with that which is mentioned in its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	Indeed, I have already arranged the chapters of dislocations according to what preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	¶ On the care of the dislocation of the lower jawbone.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two lower jaws rarely dislocate.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of both occurs according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Either indeed they are moved from their places by a slight movement, and softened for a short time.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated completely, and until they soften to the chest part, until the saliva of the sick person flows out, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	But when the dislocation of it is small, then it returns to many positions by itself with a little bit.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	But if the dislocation is complete and whole: then it is necessary that the reduction of it be administered quickly, and not entirely delayed: and it is necessary for the nurse to hold the head of the sick person: and the physician should insert his one finger of his hand into the root of the lower jaw dislocation between his teeth, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he should insert two fingers of his hand at once, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the other fingers of his hand should be outside, which he balances.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And command the sick person to clean his jaws, and to make them ready for eating at all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	The doctor balances the mandible and pushes the mandible until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to return it, especially if both mandibles are involved at the same time, then apply heat with hot water and oil until the reduction of both is easy: do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	Therefore, when they return and balance, and the mouth of the sick person is closed and not softened, then place on them cloths of cloth with wax that has been made from wax: and with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then it will be bound with ease with soft ligatures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient sleep on his back: and his head should be between two cloths, so that he does not move it to the right and left: nor should he try or be forced to chew anything: rather, give him soft food, until when the pains are removed, and the jaw is bound: then he eats what he wants, and is given it with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not labor over the operation of his mouth at eating and drinking, and swallowing, until the jaw is bound, and he is healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If it is difficult to return both mandibles when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then often fevers and frequent diarrhea occur from this: and perhaps the belly of the sick person is loosened, and perhaps he vomits pure bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	Therefore, when you see this, then you will know that it is a loss, and often that person dies within ten days who experiences this.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the sternum and the extremity of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The sternum is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated towards the outside: and this is indicated by sensation.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is that the sick person lies on his back, and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then cut the place with your palm firmly, for it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place on it a plaster, and bandages, and bind it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	In fact, the extremities which follow the arm, and are connected with it, do not usually become dislocated, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	But if it becomes dislocated on some day: then it must be reduced and adjusted according to what we said, and that which is prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place on it a plaster, and bandages, and bind it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And command the sick person to stick to tranquility and quietness until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when this same cure reduces the extremity of the arm, even if it is separated from its place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ On the reduction of the dislocation of the arm.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the arm does not become dislocated, except in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is, that it becomes dislocated towards the part of the shoulder to the lower parts.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it becomes dislocated towards the part of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it becomes dislocated towards the upper part of the arm: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it does not become dislocated to the backs, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not become dislocated to the fronts, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most often dislocated and removed towards the lower parts towards the shoulder: especially in those whose flesh is little.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Because I go out of them quickly, and enter quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those whose flesh is abundant, it is the opposite, that is, he goes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens to some people that they are hit or fall, and the shoulder becomes an abscess with heat, and it is thought to be because of that, since it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	Therefore, one must try this until you are certain of its truth, and then proceed to its cure.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And it is known that the dislocation is when it is towards the inferiors against the acromion: and you distinguish between the dislocated shoulder and the healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find among them a manifest difference, and you will find in the head of the shoulder a hollow, and under the acromion at the touch of the head of the shoulder as if it were an egg: and the weak one cannot reduce his hand to his ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then you will find a clear touch, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this dislocation is easily reduced when it is recent, or the boy is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is that the assistant raises his hand to the upper parts.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then you place your thumbs under his acromion, and raise the joint with strength upwards to its place: and the assistant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he should put it down below, for it returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If not, and if the days since it happened are many: then one must bathe the weak one in hot water, and apply an embrocation that softens and soothes, as if they were boiling the roots of althea, and foenugraecum, and melilot in water, and apply.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick person should lie on their back: and place a sphere and wool under their chin, which should be equal in softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor should place their heel on the sphere, and lift up the arm with strength, and pull the hand of the sick person towards the lower parts.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And another assistant should hold the head of the sick person, so that they do not move towards the lower parts: for indeed, he returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you wish, reduce him according to this manner: and it is, that you make present a man who is longer than the sick person, and stand on the side, and insert his arm under the chin of the sick person: and lift up their chin to the upper parts, until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another assistant should pull the hand of the sick person towards the lower parts of their belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then it is necessary, that he be suspended with something else, which weighs him down: for the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he is also reduced according to another manner: and it is, that a long piece of wood be shaped on the ground, whose head is round in figure: like the handle of a mortar: which is not thick, nor fine.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then place it under the sick person after they have placed cloth over his head on the piece of wood: and the sick person should stand according to the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then stretch his hand towards the lower parts on the other side, and stretch his body from the other side with strength: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	But if his reduction through all that we have said is difficult: then use this care: and it is, that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two biceps, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers: which has a round head, so that its entrance into the depth of the chin is eased, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then, clean the round head of the needle, so that it does not wound the weak wood.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then, place the weak needle under the tilt, so that the hand or arm is stretched over the wood until the lower part: and tie the wood on the support and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then, place the arm on the width of the ladder step, and stretch the hand to the lower part, and let go of the remaining body hanging from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	For the joint enters immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	Therefore, when the entrance to it is completed according to any possible mode: then it is necessary to place under the tilt an equal quantity of woolen ball from the lamb.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then, place the prepared plaster from the flour mill with bdellium and egg white on the entire arm, as it rolls over.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then, tie under the tilt a decent binding: and roll the bandage over the plaster above: and attach his hand to his neck, and let go, and do not move his hand for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to place food for the weak one, until the member is strengthened: because it is faster for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then, place a larger one after seven days or five, and exercise it with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If therefore it is strengthened and not softened, then it is already healed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	But if the joint is often dislocated due to moisture that happens to it, or for another reason: then it is necessary to administer a cautery in it with three holes, according to what was prescribed in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	But if this is all done, and the bandage is dissolved after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and binding are rolled back over it several times, and it does not strengthen, and it falls, and it cannot be raised to the upper parts: then you know that the nerves of his arm which are near the head of the humerus, have been cut, or stretched, or softened: and you know that the joint will never be in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	For dislocations that occur towards the chest and breasts, or towards the back, reduction is achieved with impulse and extension of the hands: until it returns to its original position, and it is treated with the remaining bandaging and care, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, after healing, there is a severe injury in the limb and slowness in its movement, then the patient should frequently use the bathhouse, until that severity is eased, and it returns to its original nature.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	§ On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and it also returns to its original position with difficulty: and indeed it can be dislocated in all directions, and especially towards the front or the back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it falls under the sight and touch, in whatever shape it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join the dislocated elbow to a healthy one, it is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For indeed the joint is bent, and it cannot double the arm, nor touch its own shoulder with it.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary for you to act quickly and reduce the dislocation immediately, before an inflammation of hot pus occurs in it.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if an inflammation of hot pus occurs in it, its reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it will not be healed at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For indeed it is worse in all kinds of dislocations, and more intense pain arises from them: and it often dies along with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration when it is from those that can be reduced, is to extend the hand with both hands: and the arm is expanded, and the hands of the physician are above the elbow and below it, and he pushes the joint with his fingers or with the root of his palm, until it returns to its original place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or rather, it is a dislocation towards the front: then he should return as follows, so that he doubles his hand with his own hand, until he strikes with the root of his palm his own elbow which is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	But if the dislocation does not obey reduction, then administer strong, very forceful extension: and it is, so that two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants also hold him, so that he is not moved during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm should be rolled back to all parts after it has been unrolled over his hand, with a long doubled cloth or broad ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with oil: so that it is from those which help in the lubricity of the joint with facility.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he should push the joint with strong impulse, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after its reduction, it is necessary that it be placed on it a plaster, in which there is stipticity, and exiccation with whiting: and it is bound with a proper bandage.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And the arm should be suspended from the neck of the weak: and let it be released for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it should be unbound.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	But if the joint is strengthened in its place, then unbind the ligament from it, and let it be released.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not well bound, then repeat the plaster, and the ligament, and let it be released for several days, until it is bound.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then unbind it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	But if a seriousness occurs to him after the reduction of the joint, and the position is in motion: then administer moisture in bathing, and gentle friction, and compression, until it is lined, or place on the joint, that is, the fat of a young ram.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then bind it up and let her go on that day and at night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then remove it and put him into a bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he sweats, then gently rub the joint with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat the application of the ointment once, and twice, and three times with entry into the bath, until it is soothed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place on her the warm dung of a cow, moistened with hot butter, and wrap it around him.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	For she is indeed soothed, and returns to her proper condition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ On the treatment of dislocation of Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	Almahassem's hand is often dislocated, that is, the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And its reduction of dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	On the contrary, the rest of the joints.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed of the reduction of this dislocation be in the hour in which it occurs, before the wound closes: or an hot abscess occur in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of the dislocation is such that one places Almahassem's weak hand on a table, and extends the minister's hand: and the physician places his hand on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary to consider if the palm of the hand has already receded to the wrist: then one places the weak back of his hand on the table at extension and reduction: and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand is inside on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand is placed on the table, so that the hand of the physician falls on that prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then bind it with a plaster containing a styptic for the stoppage of the abscess, and do not repeat this.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not tolerate it, and you are unable to apply further reduction to him, after the days pass by, nevertheless the union remains according to its curvature: and nothing harms the sick except that the hand becomes soft, and cannot bind anything: then you know that the nerves have been cut or torn.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is therefore no other skill in it than to bind it with a cauterizing iron near the wound.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not heal anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When therefore Albucasis does not return, then apply the plaster which we have mentioned to him.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then he is bound and let go for five days: after that, it is dissolved and let go, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if his movement is lost, and something heavy occurs to him: then ease it with warm water, and friction several times, until it is eased.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	¶ On the Cure of Dislocations of the Fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When the finger is dislocated from any of them, or the finger from the back of the palm, or its belly: then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your fingers, until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it turned towards the part to which it is dislocated, and let it go for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it becomes straight on its day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When therefore it is night, bind it according to the same account: and do not cease to dissolve it in the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Do this for several days until it is tightly bound.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of your hand: and bind it to that part, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with it when it is dislocated towards the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	¶ On the treatment of dislocation of the sacrum in the back.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to someone that the sacrum in the back or the neck is completely dislocated, or many spines are moved from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches the weak person.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the sickness of the weak person passes out without will, and he cannot hold it: and often some of his limbs are softened from it, or both his legs, or both his arms, or one of them: or one spine is moved from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For often it is moved, because often the movement of them happens to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Those therefore which are moved towards the back, are called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of this however is, that you consider at that time, if Gibbosity happens from childhood: then there is no cure for it, nor is there any healing at all from it.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In that however which happens by chance, or by blow, or by similar things, the ancients have already spoken of a lengthy method of cure in their talk.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Of which very little returns with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I however have already abbreviated from it, of which little excuses it from much of its proximity to my intention: and from my exposure which I exposed it, and formed an instrument of it in a different way than they showed it, and exposed it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say therefore, that in the hardness which occurs from the front part, there is no skill, nor healing from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly in that which is made on both sides also.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not treated from them, except that which occurs on the back properly, when I say: and it is, that the weak one be stretched out on his face on a board near the wall: and the wet cloth is spread under him, so that he is not harmed by his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight piece of wood is placed on the floor, in the end of the board, near his head: and another piece of wood near his feet in the other end of the board: and the servant holds the wood, and it is not firmly fixed in the fork.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And the other servant holds the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then he is rolled over on the weak one's head, and under his tongue a strong bandage, firm: and extend the end of the bandage to the wood that is by his head: and tie it in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then tie another bandage above his heels, and above his knees, and by his calves.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages, and tie them on the other wood that is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then all the servants stretch out to the part of the wood where the bandage is tied, and the two woods are not moved from the places where they are fixed: but they are not tightened, as we said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the doctor puts his hands on the spine with strength, until he returns: or puts a board on it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he connects his feet on the board, until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not return by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And also prepare a location on the wall that we mentioned is near the weak one, where the end of the board can enter.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board on the Spondyle.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the doctor put his feet on the other end.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And he should tie it well until the Spondyle is covered, and then return to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with the saw that is wrapped around your hand: and it is to make two pieces of wood on the ground near the head of the sick person in the last of the feet, whose length is the arm of one: and at his head in the last of the feet, two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And its length should be the same as every wood, a palm: and now there is a hole in every place where the saw ran: and all the wood is firmly fixed on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And the round wood is inserted: and there is a saw in which the ligament is rolled up in two holes of two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end is a hole, in which the wood that is firmly fixed, whose length is the same as that which rolls up, is in two other pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the ligaments that you tied in the chest of the sick person with the saw that is at his head: and the ligaments that you tied in his legs with the saw that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every saw, which turns the hand with the leather, with which the saw is rolled up: and the doctor balances the Spondyle, as we said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the shape of the saw that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then when the Spondyle returns and the place is balanced, then you should put an evaporative plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	Then, a bandage.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Afterwards, place a stellate bandage above the plaster, whose width is three fingers, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length is the amount that will cover the sacrum and on the healthy spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is tied with the bandage we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And the sick person should use this delicate nourishment until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If something remains prominent in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and alleviate, with the administration of the tablet we mentioned for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now it is applied to that lead sheet.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes a prominence occurs at the last spine of the back: and it is thought to be due to dislocation, and that is the bone that already protrudes.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it is not necessary to make a presumption about him with this medicine: for perhaps he will cause death to happen.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the joint of the ankle and the joint of the arm do not occur except in dislocation alone: nor does it happen to them that what happens to the other joints from slight removal and concavity.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the joint of the ankle is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	That is, because it is dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And it is very much dislocated towards the inside: and a little dislocated towards the front and the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of the dislocation towards the inside is because when you join the leg of the sick person with the sick, it is longer: and his knee is higher than that of the healthy one, and the sick person cannot double his foot near the groin: and the place that follows the groin is swollen with hot abscess, therefore because the head of the hip has already reached there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And its sign, which occurs when there is a dislocation to the exterior, is that it is opposite in nature to these accidents.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And its sign, which occurs when there is a dislocation to the front, is that it stretches the healthy leg according to its complement: however, it does not double it without pain in the knee: and if it tries to walk, it cannot step forward: and it retains its urine, and it develops an abscess in its groin, and it limps when walking, stepping on its heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And its sign, which occurs when there is a dislocation to the back, is that it does not stretch the knee, and it cannot double it before doubling the groin: and its leg is also shorter than the other: and the groin is softened, and it is the hip joint at the place of the other.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this type of dislocation is indeed, that you should consider whether the dislocation is old and has already outlived its time in the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it is not necessary to make a complete assumption of it.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in the one whose dislocation is recent, and it is of a type of four dislocations: then hasten to this, that you fold the joint, and extend it both to the interior and to the exterior, and move it with your right and left hand: for perhaps it returns, and does not require any other cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if it does not return in this way, then you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg from the lower part: or with your hands, or with a bandage that is tied above the leg on the knee: and another assistant extends his hand above, so that he may insert his hands under the tendons of it.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he ties with a thin ligature over the root of the thigh bone, and holds the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And it should be extended from the front part of the groin to the part of the backbone, or from the back to the part of the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And it should be extended with one pull of equal strength, until the weak one is lifted up with his body from the ground, and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this kind of extension is a common kind among the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with what we said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every kind of that which I will say about its proper cure.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the proper reduction of it, however, when the dislocation is to the insides, it is necessary that the weak one should lie down on his sound side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let him place the ligament over the root of the thigh bone, in that which is between the hip joint and the part under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then let him extend the ligament upwards from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the part of the backbone.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then let another strong assistant take his arms, and reduce the large part of the weak one's hip, and extend it to the outer extension with great force.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	Now indeed it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this kind is easier of all kinds of cures by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	But if it excuses itself to you, and does not obey you with this kind of cure at all: then it is necessary that two weak feet should be bound together with a strong ligament, and a thin one, over the two heels, and over the two knees; and the length of each should be equal to four fingers from its corresponding part: and the weak leg should be extended more than the other by the length of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the sick person is suspended over the head of a tree, which is in the house, and its length should be equal to the distance from the ground to the armpit of two men.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong young man to protect the hip: and suspend him with the sick person in another place: and push the other young man, protecting the hip with strength, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	However, in its proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on the stool, as we mentioned in one with gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the tendon is tied over his leg, the sick person properly, and on his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are placed, one at his feet, and the other at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the additional beam is placed in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed: on which wet cloths are laid, so that it does not hurt the sick person: and the beam should be between his hips, so that it is not pulled downwards during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the servants stretch to their part, and the doctor equalizes the reduction by his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore it obeys the return, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place a board on it, and press it evenly, as we said in gibbosity.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary for the sick person's leg to be stretched quickly: and it is according to this same narrative on the stool: and the doctor places his right hand palm on the sick person's hip.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he binds him with his other hand, and with that binding place him stretched towards the lower part to the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	If the dislocation is to the rear: then it is not necessary for the injured person to be extended downwards and raised up on the ground: rather, it is necessary for them to be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for them to be placed in such a position if their ankle is dislocated outwards, according to what we said about their reclining position on two ankles: and the ligaments are stretched, as we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it is necessary to apply compression with a board even on the place from which the joint exits, when the reduction is completed according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you: and it is that you extend both the injured legs: and when you see them equal, and the injured person contracts their leg and expands it without any excuse: then you know that the limb has already returned, according to what is necessary: then join the two thighs and apply a plaster, and bind with imemati, that is, a wheel: in such a way that the ankle does not move towards any part of the body: and let the injured person remain quiet for three days or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then loosen the ligament, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then you know that the dislocation is already firm: therefore complete the injured person for walking.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see anything of softening: then return and apply the plasters again, and bind it according to your first binding: and let it go for three days also.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then loosen it and make it slow in walking on both sides for several days until it is strong again.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	On Dislocation of the Knee
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	The dislocation is directed towards the externals, internals, and inferiors, namely towards the posteriors.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated towards the anteriors.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the sick person to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if it does not stick to the hip, then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	And the restoration of all its modes of dislocation is to make the sick person sit straight, so that he can extend his leg as much as possible over it, and his back against his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then hold the knee with your hands, and straighten them across your fingers above the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your hand two sides of the knee with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another servant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of its return is that the leg sticks to the hip in ease, not with difficulty.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply plasters to him, and make the leg stick to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it together with a bandage and a splint for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then unbind it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the sick person should not use walking for several days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if he refuses to reduce it to you, then apply strong extension with bandages, of which the previous description is given in the cure of the ankle, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	On the cure of the dislocation of the heel bone.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel bone sometimes moves slightly and sometimes is dislocated according to the complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is made, either towards the internals, or towards the externals.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	The sign of its dislocation is that you see the calcaneum (heel bone) inflated, protruding towards the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	However, its cure and removal are easy to restore: and it is to be stretched gently with the hands, and evened, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In its cure however, when it dislocates according to the complement, it is necessary that you make the patient sit upright: and hold it firmly with a strong helper from the posterior part of his back, in the middle of itself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold you with your right hand from the upper part of his foot, and with your left hand from the lower part of his foot in the place of the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left hand in two ways.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then stretch with your left hand, and push the foot's chest towards the leg without labor.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice, as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the foot's chest towards the leg in the third way, and you pull the heel.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If therefore it returns to the first way, or to two ways according to this method, and you see the foot evened, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation on it: for it returns.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if it is prohibited to you to reduce it with that which we have said: then make the patient lie down on his back on the ground, and fix a firm board in the ground strongly, so that he falls between his hips: and you have already uncovered over him the cloth, so that he does not hurt the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the helper receive his hip: afterwards let the helper extend his foot, or with his hands, or with a band that ties on the neck of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then every assistant should stand against the extension of his equal: and a staff should be standing between the two hips of the sick person, holding him so that he is not drawn by his body towards the lower parts during the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the physician equalizes the dislocation with his hands, and the other assistant holds the healthy leg towards the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	Therefore when the dislocation returns and you are told of its health of return: then place a plaster and bandage, and bind it firmly with bands, and tie the foot with a band to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you beware of the cavities or fear the nerves which are above the heel of the back, so that there is not a strong band over them and they are not harmed.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the band is softened, bind it again: then dissolve it on the third day or fourth day: and prevent the sick person from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	Indeed if he tries to walk before that time, there is no safety that the dislocation above him does not dissolve and decay, and does not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If however a boil hot occurs to him: then it is necessary that the attendant in the sedation of him in which our previous account preceded in another place from the cure and ointment, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	§ On Dislocation of Toes of the Foot, and Cure.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that what is dislocated be equalized with them by extension a few without labor: and indeed this is not difficult, but easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in certain bends of the back of the foot: then it is necessary that he make the sick person sit his foot on a level with the earth, or on a board: and standing like walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you should stand and place your foot upon that which is higher than the others among those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then step on it with your foot with strength until it returns, and see that it is now evened out, and does not appear to be raised in place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place a board under its belly which can take the whole foot, with two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then bind it with a decent binding for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then dissolve it and let it rest from walking for many days, until it is bound and secured from the reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	¶ On the kinds of dislocation with a wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens to it and you try to cure it and restore it, death often follows: and because of this, it is not fitting for anyone to presume on its cure, which is such as this, unless he is wise in the art with long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not bold, nor presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning of medical treatments which only stop boils with hot: and let him send away the sick by divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see or hope for health from the destruction with the alleviation of illness, and in which something appears to be of hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Then try its reduction immediately at the beginning of the matter, before boil hot occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the member returns, as we wish, then administer the regimen which stops boil: and care for the wound with that which is appropriate to it from drying ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If then the dislocation is with fracture, and they occur in the bones of the separated shoulder, then try to remove them, and make in it what we said in simple illnesses from that which preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And keep your wound clean according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into the path of fear: as my previous warning advised you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring to your glory, and more saving for your body among them in your time.
