On abscesses that occur from twisting of the nerves.
Chapter 50.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, so too they occur in nerves: caused by a blow, or from excessive labor, or similar reasons; and most commonly they appear in the armpits, or the heel, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess.
Its color resembles that of the surrounding body, and it usually lacks pain; and when pressed hard, the patient feels a numbness similar to stupor.
And it is not a deep-seated abscess within the body; rather, it is beneath the skin, moves in all directions, and does not extend forward or backward.
Therefore, those found in the joints should not be attacked with a blade.
For contraction may indeed occur.
In those cases found on the head or forehead, make an incision in the skin with a small scalpel.
If it is a small abscess, then hold it with forceps and cut it off at the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, scrape it off, then remove it, bring the wound together with sutures, and care for it until it heals.
