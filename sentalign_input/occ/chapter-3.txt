Thus begins the prologue of the third part: on restoration.
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine; it is the restoration of fracture and dislocation incidents in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish doctors and laypeople boast of this chapter and those who have never regarded the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter of them.
And for this reason, this manner of the learned in our land is private; and I have not forgotten this at any time; and I have not adopted this except through long study of the books of the Ancients and study on the understanding of them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And then I applied it to experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experiment is based; as I have abbreviated this for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have abbreviated this to the end of abbreviation; and I have shown this at the end of clarification; and I have formed in this many forms of the instruments that are administered in it, as it is done by adding clarification, as I have done in the previous two chapters.
