Chapter forty-four on cauterizing gout and joint pains.	CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR. On cauterization of gout and pain in the joints.	0.8873869
If joint pains are due to cold humors flowing to any part of the body And if the pains occur in the legs, then it is the custom of physicians to call that specifically gout.	When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'.	0.84060335
So if cold-caused gout is treated with the types of treatment that we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them.	When gout due to chill has been treated with the various treatments mentioned in its section, and the pains remain, the cautery will remove them.	0.76064205
And that is to cauterize it after emptying (purgation) around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations.	That is, you cauterize the patient with multiple burns around the joint of the foot, after he has been purged.	0.6156897
And the cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized in this way:	The cautery should be a middle-sized olivary one, thus.	0.56872034
If the pains rise to the knees or to the other joints, and this often happens, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.	If you need to make punctate cauterizations round the front of the foot, use the punctate cautery; and if the pains go up to the knee or other joints, which often happens, burn each knee with three or four cauterizations on every side with the same olivary cautery.	0.8355188
If you need more than this cauterization, cauterize him, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery, but let it be about the thickness of the skin only.	And if you require to cauterize him more than this, do it, but do not go deeply but only about the thickness of the skin.	0.790856
If the pains rise to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned of cauterization in its chapter.	If the pains go up to the hip joints or the back, employ those cauterizations that we have mentioned in their own chapter.	0.90417504
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the two forearms as you go around two rows.	And if the pains are in the hands only, pierce a double line all around the wrists.	0.79096794
If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize them on each knuckle a spot and on the back of the hand.	If the pains remain in the fingers, pierce them once over each joint and once on the metacarpus.	0.7884758
If the pains rise after days to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize them on each side.	And if after some days the pains go up to the elbows or shoulders then cauterize both on each side.	0.8944291
And the sick person should not be without good management and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and vomits the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.	And keep the patient to good habits and taking of medicine; for if his regimen be good and the phlegm got rid of, he will be cured with this cautery.	0.70546865
