A corn is a round knot, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, that forms throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and the toes, and causes pain when walking.	A corn is a round knob, the same colour as the body and resembling the head of a nail. It occurs in all parts of the body but particularly in the soles of the feet and the toes, whence arises pain in walking.	0.9220028
It should be incised around the corn and grasped with tweezers or a hook and removed from its root, then treated.	You should cut away what is round the corn and take it with forceps or a hook and tear it out by the root; then dress it.	0.8055736
And if you wish, cauterize it as described previously in its chapter.	If you wish you may cauterize it in the manner already described in the book on cauterization.	0.67966557
As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, dense, round protuberance on the surface of the body, and frequently occurs on the hands of children.	Then concerning dry warts: a wart is a little round rough compact eminence on the surface of the body; it occurs often on the hands of boys.	0.74908316
Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it off, or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it as described previously with fire or a sharp medicine.	Now the treatment is to draw out the wart and cut if off; or tie it off with a silken thread or a hair until it falls out; or if you wish, cauterize as said before, either with the actual cautery or with caustic.	0.8585065
Inverted and non-inverted warts can be removed with the instrument that I mentioned in the treatment of moles.	Sometimes warts, inverted or otherwise, are uprooted with the instrument I shall describe under the treatment of pimples.	0.5024632
As for a mole, it is also a small, dense, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going very deep, and if cold affects it, one feels in it something similar to the sting of ants, and it occurs throughout the body, mostly on the hands.	A pimple is also a little compact thick prominence on the skin surface, going deep; when it gets cold there is a feeling as of an ant's sting in it. It is found all over the body but mostly on the hands.	0.7675024
Its treatment is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong eagle feather, and place that tube on the mole until the circle of the tube surrounds it from all sides, then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the mole and make it go deep into the flesh, and the mole will be removed from its root.	The treatment is to take the quill of a strong feather of the goose or the vulture, and place the quill over the pimple so as to encircle it with the circumference of the tube; then revolve the quill with your hand so as to cut all round the pimple, and go deep into the flesh, and then the pimple may be drawn out by the roots.	0.88585
And if you wish, you can do that with a copper or iron tube in this manner.	If you wish you may extract it with a tube of bronze or of iron, of this form.	0.8298163
The top of the tube to the thin part should be solid and twisted to make it easy for the fingers to hold and twist it.	The upper closed part of the tube should be fine, solid, and twisted, to give easy purchase for the fingers in holding and revolving it.	0.84551215
And if you wish, cauterize the fistula as described previously in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.	If you wish you may cauterize the pimple as described earlier on the cauterization of warts in the book on the cautery.	0.7900616
