of the rupture of the peritoneum
The occurrence of this branch is by the tear that comes in the peritoneum, or the stretching over the belly in the area of the groin, which causes the intestines to descend from this rupture to one of the testicles; and this rupture is either in the peritoneum itself or in its stretching, and these two types come from many causes: either from a blow, or from jumping, or from shouting, or from lifting a heavy load, and from similar things; and the sign when it is from the stretching of the peritoneum, is that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the swelling is even down to the depths, because the peritoneum presses on the intestine.
And the sign when it is from the tear of the peritoneum, is that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the swelling appears varied, close under the skin, and this is because of the exit of the intestine and the body outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and is retained within, and causes great pain to the patient, especially when it is compressed.
And in these treatments, using iron is feared, therefore it should be avoided.
And the method of the procedure is as follows: you instruct the patient to push the intestine back inside the wound with his hand, if he can return it; then he should be supported on his neck, between your hands, and lift his thighs; then stretch the scrotum upwards, and cut all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise; then insert hooks into the lips of the incision according to what you need to open the wound, and let them be such that the testicles can come out; then peel the peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the white, hard peritoneum is uncovered on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the testicle, and between the second peritoneum, and separate that which is behind the testicle, and between the second peritoneum; and then move your right hand inside the scrotum, and stretch the white peritoneum upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all the peritoneum towards the incision; and instruct the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and untie that which is attached behind the ligament; and search with your fingers if there is any of the intestine wrapped in the white, hard peritoneum, and if you find anything, push it down into the abdomen; then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten strands, and insert it into the back part of the peritoneum, which is behind the skin of the scrotum; after the incision, then cut the ends of the threads that appear, so that there are four threads; then assemble them one on top of the other in the shape of a cross, and tie the peritoneum, which we have said is under the skin of the scrotum, with a strong ligature in two places; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them tightly in two places, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter into them, so that no hot swelling occurs there; and place another ligature in line with the first ligature, two fingers away from it, and after these two ligatures, leave the width of a finger of the peritoneum which is under the scrotum; and after all the other, following the roundness that the testicle bears; then cut in the part which is under the skin of the scrotum, until the blood flows, and the pus, as we have said previously; then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned.
And sometimes the white peritoneum that we have mentioned is cauterized, after the incision, for fear of bleeding.
For this happens often, and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself; and if it is slow to fall, it should be moistened with warm water, and apply what we have mentioned, until it falls; then treat the wound with other treatments, until it is completely healed.
