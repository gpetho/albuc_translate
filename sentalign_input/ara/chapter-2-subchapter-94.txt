Chapter Ninety-Four.
On Extracting Arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the locations in which they occur in the body. As for their difference according to their types, some of them are large and small, some are hollow glass and solid glass, and some of them have three angles and four angles.
And some of them have tongues, and some of them have splinters. As for those that are according to the organs in which they occur, they are of two types: either the organs are among the principal hollow organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like.
So when an arrow strikes one of these organs and the signs of death appear to you, which I will describe to you later, then you should avoid removing that arrow from them, because death follows its owner in most cases.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you and the arrow has not disappeared into the depths of the organ, then remove it and treat the wound. And among the signs of the brain if an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone and wounds the membrane that is on the brain, a severe headache, torpor, and dizziness occur from that.
And redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, confusion of mind, and vomiting bile. And perhaps blood comes out of the nostrils or ears, and perhaps speech is interrupted and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling porridge comes out of the place of the wound, and something like the water of meat flows from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and removing the arrow if it has not come out. As for the signs of the arrow if it strikes the heart and is close to the left breast, it feels as if it has been embedded in something solid, not in something empty.
And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, followed by coldness of the extremities, a cold sweat, and fainting. Know that death is inevitably descending.  And the sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the emergence of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels that follow the neck swell, and the patient's color changes, and he breathes heavily and seeks to inhale cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm that is in the chest, it will be close to the small ribs and breathing will be labored with severe pain.
And he sighs and all the members of the shoulders move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows it, and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes out of the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, some undigested food may come out of the wound.
And its matter is apparent. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and sticks in it, and something of the stool comes out of the wound, or the omentum, or an intestine has been perforated, then there is no hope in treating him nor in removing the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine comes out.
And if something protrudes from it to the outside, and the pain intensifies on the patient, know that he is perishing. As for the other organs, such as the face, eye, throat, shoulder, upper arm, spine, clavicle, thigh, leg, and similar organs, they are most often safe.
When the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and the arrow is not poisoned. And I will tell you some of what I have witnessed regarding these arrows so that you may be guided by it in your treatment. An arrow struck a man in the corner of his eye at the root of his nose.
I extracted it for him from the other side, under the earlobe, and he recovered and no harm happened to his eye. I extracted another arrow for a Jew who had been struck in the corner of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had disappeared, and I could only find its small end that attaches to the shaft.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with smooth, square iron, and it had no barbs. The Jew recovered, and no ill befel his eye. I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabian.
It is the one with two barbs. I made an incision for him between the jugular veins, and it had sunk into his throat. I treated him gently until I extracted it, and the Christian survived and recovered. I extracted another arrow for a man who had been struck in his abdomen, and we thought that he would die from it.
When he remained for a period of thirty days or so, and nothing in his condition changed, I made an incision over the arrow and worked on it carefully, and I extracted it, and he recovered, and no ill befel him. I saw a man who had been struck by an arrow in his back, and the wound closed over it.
Then, after seven years, the arrow came out at the top of his thigh. I saw a woman who had been struck in her abdomen by an arrow, and the wound closed, and the arrow remained, and nothing in her condition changed, nor did she feel any harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man who was struck by an arrow in his face, and the wound closed, and it remained without him feeling much pain. And of such cases there are many. I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the sultan's commanders, who had been struck in the middle of his nose; it had deviated slightly to the right side.
And the entire arrow disappeared. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck him. I found the arrow's wound very narrow, so I probed it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it.  He felt a prickling and pain under his ear on the right side.
I hoped that the prickling was from the tip of the arrow.  So I dressed the area with a dressing that had the power to draw and ripen, hoping that the area would swell and a sign of the arrow would appear, so that I could make an incision over it. But nothing happened in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that spot.
So I continued with the dressing on it for many days, but nothing happened. Then during that time the wound closed and the patient remained despairing of its removal for a period, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose. He told me the news, so I applied the sharp, corrosive medication to the wound for many days.
Until it opened and I probed it. I felt the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the shaft.  Then I continued to open the wound with that sharp medication until the tip of the arrow became clearly visible to us. This took me a period of time, about four months.
Then when the wound widened and it became possible for me to insert hooks into it, I pulled and moved it, but it would not come out. I continued to coax it and try various instruments on it, until one day I grasped it with well-made hooks, the image of which will come at the end of the chapter.
Until I extracted it. Then I treated the wound.
And the physicians were certain that the cartilage of his nose would not heal. But I treated it, and the wound healed, and the patient recovered completely, not harmed at all. I am informing you of the method of extracting some arrows so that you may use that as a standard and a guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the details and particulars of this craft cannot be grasped by description, nor can a book encompass it. Rather, the skilled practitioner extrapolates from the little to the much, and from what is present to what is absent, and devises a new procedure and a new instrument for unusual incidents.
Concerning the extraction of arrows from this profession, I say that arrows are extracted from the organs in which they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite side.  Those which are extracted from where they entered...
...if the arrow is protruding in a fleshy area, it is pulled and extracted. If it does not yield to extraction at the time it occurred, then you should leave it for several days until the flesh around it putrefies, making it easy to pull and extract. Likewise, if it is lodged in bone.
And if it does not yield to extraction, also leave it for days and try pulling and moving it every day, for it will come out. If it does not yield to extraction after several days, then you should perforate around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine perforator until you widen [the hole] for the arrow, then pull and extract it.
If the arrow is lodged in the bone of the skull and has penetrated deep into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the symptoms I have mentioned appear in the patient, refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until his condition becomes clear after several days.
If the arrow has reached the meninges, death will not delay him. However, if the arrow is only lodged in the bone itself and has not passed into the meninges, and the patient survives for several days without experiencing any of these symptoms...
then attempt to pull and extract the arrow. If it is firmly lodged and does not yield to pulling, then use the perforators around the arrow as I have described to you, and then treat the area until it heals.  But if the arrow is embedded in some part of the body...
and hidden from the senses, then search for it with the probe. If you feel it, pull it with some of the instruments suitable for extracting it. If you cannot do so because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vessel there...
then enlarge the wound by incising it so that you can reach the arrow and extract it. If it has barbs, grasp them and free the flesh embedded in them from every side by whatever means you can. If you are unable to free the flesh, try to break the barbs and twist them until you free them.
When you attempt to extract the arrow, wherever it may be, twist your hand with the hooks in all directions until you free it. Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making it difficult for you to pull and extract it. If you are unable to do so immediately...
then leave it for a few days until the flesh around it putrefies, then try again, for it will then be easier. If you encounter bleeding, use the treatment we mentioned in its chapter. Take great care not to cut a vessel, nerve, or tendon, and use ingenuity.
By whatever means you can, extract the arrow, but do so gently, slowly, and steadily as I have described to you. When you pull the arrow, it is best to position the patient in the same way they were when the arrow struck them.
If you cannot do this, then use whatever position you can. As for the arrow that emerges from the opposite side, either a part of it will have protruded outwards, or you will find the tip of the arrow close to the surface of the skin by feeling it and you will see it bulging.
Make an incision over it, just large enough to fit the hooks, then pull it, for it will be easy to extract. If it is stuck in a bone, twist your hand in a circular motion so that the arrow affects the bone and widens the space for itself, then pull it.
If not, leave it for a few days and then try again until it comes out. If the arrow's shaft is still attached, push on it.  If the shaft has fallen off and you wish to push it, insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the notch of the arrowhead, then push with it.
If the arrow is hollow, push it with an instrument that fits into the hollow, as this will make the arrow easier to extract.  If the arrow is poisoned, you should excise all the flesh that the poison has reached, if possible, then treat it appropriately.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or side, and is close enough to be probed and you can make an incision over it, then make an incision, taking care not to cut any vein or nerve, and extract it.
Then suture the wound if it requires stitching, then treat it until it heals.  Image of the hooks with which arrows are extracted:.
Their ends are like a bird's beak, made like a file; when they grip the arrow or something, they do not let go.  They are made in large, small, and medium sizes, all according to the size of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.
Image of the hollow pusher:.
Image of the solid pusher:.
This one has a solid end like a probe so that it easily enters the hollow arrow and pushes it.
