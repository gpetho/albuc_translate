 CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX.
On cauterization of the stomach.
 When cold and many humidities get into the stomach, so that its constitution is disturbed and much fluxion has come to it, and a variety of treatment has been tried to no effect, the patient must be put on his back with legs and arms outstretched; then give him a threefold cauterization: one a finger's breadth below the hollow of the chest with the claviform cautery; and two below and to the sides of the first cauterization, so that it has a triangular appearance; but there should be some distance between each lest they run together when suppuration sets in.
Let the depth of the burning be two-thirds of the depth of the skin.
Let the shape of the cauterizations be thus and of no more than this size.
If you wish, make a single large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, thus.
The cautery for this single cauterization is circular, thus.
The stomach may be cauterized with punctures in the case of a person who fears this operation.
You will have marked the points with ink on the stomach, as many as you wish; then sear with a punctate cautery.
Then treat as previously described until he be healed.
