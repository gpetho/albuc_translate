The first chapter on cauterization.
And before we mention the procedure with it, it is necessary that we mention the nature of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
So I say that the discussion about the nature of the benefit and harm of cautery is a long discussion, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a group of sages have spoken about it and differed about it.
And I have summarized from their words the little, for fear of prolixity.
So I say that cautery is generally useful for every bad temperament that is with matter and without matter, except for two temperaments, which are the hot temperament without matter and the dry temperament without matter.
As for the dry temperament with matter, they have differed about it, so some of them said that cautery is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite of that, that cautery is not suitable for a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is impossible to be cured from a hot dry disease with a hot dry remedy.
And the one who says the opposite of that said that cautery with fire may benefit from a hot dry disease that occurs in people's bodies, because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I say according to his saying because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that it is not appropriate for anyone to imagine about that matter except one who has practiced and trained in the field of cautery with extensive training and has observed the difference in people's temperaments and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, their symptoms, and their duration.
And as for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially the cold, moist diseases, for all the physicians have agreed on them and have not differed about the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cautery with fire, and its superiority over cautery with burning medicine, because fire is a simple substance whose action does not exceed the organ that is cauterized, and it does not harm another organ connected to it except with slight harm.
And cautery with burning medicine, its action may extend to what is beyond the organs, and perhaps it causes in the organ a disease whose treatment is difficult, and perhaps it kills.
And fire, due to its nobility and the generosity of its substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
And that has become clear to us through experience, due to the length of service and care for the craft and observing the realities of the matter, and for this reason I have dispensed with lengthy speech.
And were it not that it is not appropriate for this book of mine, I would have presented to you regarding fire a mysterious secret and the nature of its action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative words that are too subtle for your understanding.
And know, my sons, that they have differed about the time in which cautery is suitable, and they have considered the best time to be the time of spring.
And I say that cautery may be suitable in every time, because the harm that occurs from the time is absorbed in the benefit that is brought about by cautery, especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, urgent pains that do not tolerate delay, because it is feared that they will be followed by a calamity that is greater than the slight harm that comes from the time.
And do not let it occur to your minds, my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that the cautery that cures from a certain disease will never return, and you consider it blameworthy.
And the matter is not as you thought, because cautery is just like the medicine that alters the temperament and dries the moistures that are the cause of the occurrence of pains, except that cautery is superior to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease will return at some point in time, depending on the temperament of the patient, the establishment of his disease, its strength, and what is prepared in his body from the accumulation of superfluities in it, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and such causes.
However, unless the disease in which cautery is used is a mild disease and in an organ with few superfluities and moistures, such as cauterizing the tooth for pain and the like, it is possible that the pain will not return in it, and that is in the minority of cases.
And as for the saying of the common people also that cautery is the last of medicine, it is a correct saying, not in what they mean, because they believe that no treatment is beneficial with medicine or otherwise after cautery occurs, and the matter is contrary to that, but rather the meaning that cautery is the last of medicine is that when we use various types of treatment for a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use the last thing, cautery, and it works, so from here it happens that cautery is the last of medicine, not in the sense that the common people and many of the ignorant physicians mean.
And the ancients have mentioned that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they only said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its substance, and they said that the place of cautery does not suppurate, and that is not absolute, because I have tried that and found it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cautery with it is better and superior to iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery iron in the fire from gold, it will not be clear to you when it heats to the extent that you want, due to the redness of gold, and because coldness quickly affects it, and if you increase the heating on it, it melts in the fire and flows, so the craftsman falls into trouble because of that, so therefore cautery with iron is faster for us and closer to correctness for the procedure, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cautery into sections that I have organized from head to toe, to facilitate for the student what he wants from it, God willing.
