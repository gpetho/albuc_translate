But if the bone is healthy, and the nail is also healthy, and the containing corner of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and made it sting and hurt it, then you should put a thin probe under the corner of the nail that stings the flesh and lift it up and cut that flesh gently and put on what remains of the flesh of the burning corrosive medicines until it all goes away, then treat it with ointments until it heals.	But if the bone be healthy and the nail also healthy, and the in-turned angle of the nail has pressed the flesh inwards and begun to stab it and injure it, you should pass a thin probe beneath the corner of the nail that presses into the flesh, and raise it up and carefully cut away that flesh and apply caustic to the remainder, until it is all gone; then dress with ointments until cured.	0.9408359
But if the corruption has affected the bone, then you should cut that bone and remove it, for it will not heal as long as there is corrupt bone in it at all.	But if it should be that the disease has already begun to involve bone, that bone should be excised and removed; for it will never heal while there remains any diseased bone.	0.82661
If you see the erosion and corruption running in the finger, then cut it in one of the phalanges as mentioned previously, then treat it until it heals.	And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading in the finger, amputate it at one of the joints, as has been previously mentioned; then dress it until it is healed.	0.816857
If the nail is struck or bruised and there is severe pain in it, then it is necessary to phlebotomize the patient first, then incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh under the nail with the incision, for you will cause severe pain to the patient and it will be a reason for the growth of excess flesh in the place, then treat the place with something that soothes the pains.	If a laceration or bruising happen to the nail, with violent pain, you should first bleed the patient and then cut away the nail with a sharp scalpel, a swerving cut from top to bottom. But be careful not to cut into the nail-bed, for you will give the patient violent pain and it will cause a growth of superfluous flesh at the place.	0.84382576
As for the one that grows in the finger at one of the phalanges, it should first be cut flesh, a circular cut to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that, then treat it until it heals.	In the case of one growing from the finger at a phalangeal joint, you should first cut through the flesh down to the bone with a circular incision; then saw the bone through, with one of the saws that suit the purpose; then dress it until it heals.	0.8834449
As for the adhesion that occurs to the fingers with each other, this often happens, and this is something that a person is born with, and it happens when a wound heals, or a burn from fire, and so on. It is necessary to incise that adhesion until the fingers return to their natural form, then put between them wicks or rags soaked in rose oil so that they do not adhere quickly, and separate them, or put between them a thin sheet of lead until the place heals as it should.	As for webbing of the fingers one to another, that occurs very frequently. It may be either congenital or from the healing of a wound or burn or the like. You have to cut the web away until the fingers are brought back to their original form; then interpose between them a pad or piece of material soaked in oil of roses, to prevent them from rapidly joining together and to keep them apart; or you can put between them a thin sheet of lead until the healing takes place as it should.	0.8932843
Likewise, if the adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, then incise that adhesion according to what is feasible and what corrects the shape of the member.	Similarly, if one of the fingers becomes joined to the palm of the hand, cut through the adhesion according to the form it takes, and with proper regard for the shape of the member.	0.830356
