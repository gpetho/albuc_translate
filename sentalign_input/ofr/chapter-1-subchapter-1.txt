of the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is good for moisture and coldness on the brain, and there are two that are made for a disease called "soda," and for many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for excessive dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all illnesses that come from coldness like paralysis and lethargy and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The method for this cautery is that the patient be purged by a laxative medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, depending on what the strength and age and constitution of the patient can tolerate;
and then shave the patient's head.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his chest;
then place the base of your palm on the bridge of his nose between his two eyes;
and there where your middle finger falls, bleed from the vein then heat the cautery which is called "olivare," of which this is the form:
And place it on the spot marked with ink, and do so while pressing down and tightening your hand little by little while twisting;
then lift your hand quickly and look at the spot to see if you can see the bone just a little;
and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
afterwards take a little salt and put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days;
afterwards apply cotton soaked in butter;
and leave it on until the burn is gone;
afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrapharmacon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is cleansed;
and therefore it heals better/faster. (or "therefore, it promotes healing")
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, and then one cuts away what is burned from the bone, and it is treated/healed.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on, and push so strongly that one lowers/scoops out the bone as wide as a whorl that women put on their spindles so that the humors come out better/faster;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time;
afterwards one should treat and solder/close it.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some men where there is cause for fear;
and it seems better to me that I should leave it;
for the head (of the bone) is weakened by the continuous discharges of (bodily) fluids, as we observe in other limbs;
and also when the patient's head (of the bone) is naturally weak, and the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and this one I use with the work together for healing.
