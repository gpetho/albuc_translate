Chapter Thirty-Three.
On Cauterization for Diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and humidities, so that it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various treatments and has not healed, and you see that the patient can tolerate cauterization and is of sufficient strength, then cauterize his stomach with a large cauterization.
As preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four gentle cauterizations around the navel with the gentle nail-shaped cautery iron, and a large cauterization or two cauterizations on the coccyx.
If you see that the humidities are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him on the pubis and cauterize him on each flank, and perhaps add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit will not fail, God willing.
