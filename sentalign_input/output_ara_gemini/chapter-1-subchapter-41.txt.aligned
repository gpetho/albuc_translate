Chapter forty-one on cauterizing the sciatic nerve.	CHAPTER FORTY-ONE. On cauterization for sciatica.	0.78465664
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and humidity, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the division, but the treatment was not successful, and this becomes chronic, then it is necessary to purge the patient of thick humors with habb al-muntin (asafoetida) or habb al-sabari (aloe vera) and the like. Then cauterize him.	When pain occurs in the hip joint and is due to cold and humidities, and the patient has been treated by those means mentioned in the section, and the treatment is ineffectual, and the pain becomes chronic, the patient should be purged of the heavy humours with foetid pills or pills of tamarind or the like; then cauterize him.	0.74454784
And the method of cauterization in it is of two types. Either cauterization with burning medications or cauterization with fire.	The means of cauterization in this case is twofold: either with caustic chemicals or with fire.	0.7553667
And cauterization with fire is of many types.	The actual cautery will serve for several methods.	0.43179965
One of them is that you cauterize on the hip joint itself three triangular cauterizations in this manner: And it should have a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization mark should be about the thickness of a finger, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped.	One of them is to make three cauterizations over the femoral joint itself in a triangular manner ; and let them be of a fair depth; and the space between them a finger's breadth. The cautery should be an olivary one.	0.84394616
A cauterization may also be performed in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations.	Sometimes there will also be one cauterization in the middle over the actual head of the femur, making four cauterizations in all.	0.77663934
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circle that was previously mentioned in the cauterization of hip dislocation, a single cauterization, so that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns the entire thickness of the skin.	The burning may be done with the circular cautery which has been mentioned under cauterization of a dislocated hip; a single cauterization so that the circle embrace the whole joint. Burn through the whole thickness of the skin.	0.7386628
This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.	This is the form of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip joint and does not extend to the femur and the leg.	0.8908683
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize it with two cauterizations on the thigh, on the location where the patient indicates the pain, and one cauterization above the ankle by four fingers, slightly to the lateral side, and the cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.	But if it extends to the femur and the leg, cauterize him over the thigh with two burns at the place where the patient indicates the pain to be; and one burn four fingers above the great tendon of the heel, a little to the outer side. The cautery should be edged, and the depth of the burn only to the thickness of the skin.	0.8673245
And if he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize it where he indicates, with the point cautery, three or four times, or more if needed.	But if the patient points out that the pain reaches to the toes, then cauterize where he has indicated to you, with a punctate cautery, three or four or more perforations if he needs it.	0.8384161
And if he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with a single knife-shaped cauterization.	If he indicates that the pain is under the knee towards the shank, give him one burn there with the edged cautery.	0.76602614
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to reach the point of burning a nerve or a major artery, thus causing the patient a serious injury or chronic illness.	Be careful in all your cauterizing not to carry the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery; for thence arises grave harm, or crippling, to the patient.	0.8350494
I have seen one and another of those who were cauterized above the ankle, and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became infected until the infection reached the foot, and it became perforated entirely, and the entire leg was ruined, then diarrhea occurred, and death followed.	I myself have seen more than one person cauterizing over the tendon of Achilles, the cauterization being excessive, and the leg was affected with a defluxion of humours which eventually reached the foot and the whole was riddled; after that came diarrhoea, and, after that, death.	0.7935453
If the pain is in both sides, cauterize them both in this same manner.	If there is pain in two places, cauterize both in this way.	0.89822656
Some learned physicians have mentioned a cauterization for the hip, whose description is as follows: A cup-like object is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and at its mouth it is about the thickness of a date pit or slightly less, and inside that cup is another cup, and a third cup, and the distance between each two cups is about the length of a thumb joint, and the cups are open on both sides, and their height is about one or two thumb joints, and a handle of iron is made for them, firmly attached to the cups, and this is its image:	Certain learned doctors have mentioned a cauterization applicable to the hip in this manner: make a bowl of iron with a diameter of half a span; the thickness of the edge of its mouth should be that of a date-stone or a little less. Another bowl is introduced into this, and a third into that; and there is a distance between the bowls of a thumb-joint. The bowls are open on both sides; and the depth of them should be a thumb-joint or two. Make an iron handle for them firmly fitted to the bowls.	0.8859138
Then it is heated in the fire until it becomes red and throws off sparks. Then it is placed on the hip joint while the patient is leaning on the healthy side. Then cauterize him with three circular burns at once.	Then heat this cautery in the fire until it is hot and sends out sparks; and so let it be applied to the hip, the patient lying on his sound side; and thus three circular cauterizations will be produced at a time.	0.84737
Then leave him for three days and dress it with ghee. And leave the wound open for many days. Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.	Afterwards let it be for three days; then smear with butter and leave the wound open for a while; then treat with ointment till it heals.	0.8603711
The author of this book said: This type of cauterization we rarely use because of its ugliness and the dreadfulness of its appearance.	The author of this book says that we very rarely employ this method of cauterization on account of the ugliness and dread appearance of it, and because we find few patients who will endure it.	0.80174947
And because of the scarcity of those we find who can bear it, except that it is a good cauterization for those who endure it and its proper place is affected.	Nevertheless, it is one of the best cauteries for him who can endure it and is correctly treated by it.	0.5037463
As for cauterization with burning medications, it is that you make two cups, similar to the rings into which the bolt of the door descends, of copper or iron.	Cauterization with caustics is thus: make two bowls like the ring into which a door-hinge descends, either of bronze or iron.	0.773637
Let there be on their edge a height of about two knuckles or so. And let the distance between them be the width of a finger. And let them be open at the bottom, open at the top. And let them be held together in this manner:	The height of their sides should be two thumb-joints or thereabouts, and they should be separated about a finger's breadth; they should be open above and below, and joined one to another thus.	0.8453856
If the pain extends to the thigh or the leg, you make a mold for it to hold the water, just as you did with the hip.	If the pain extends to the hip joint or the leg, make a form in some material that will hold the fluid for that, just as you did for the capsule of the femur.	0.7852274
And this is the description of the corrosive water, which I have already recorded in the treatise on the Rectification of Medicines. You take one part each of alkali salt and quicklime. You crush them and place them in a new pot that has a single small hole pierced in its bottom, the size of a probe. And you place another glazed pot beneath the bottom of the pot. And you pour fresh water over the alkali and the lime to submerge them by a finger's breadth after you have mixed them well with your hand. And you leave the pot until the corrosive water drips down into the bottom of the glazed pot. Then you collect all of that water. Then you pour it over another batch of fresh lime and alkali. For then it will be very strong and sharp, effective in many medical procedures and in cauterizing all the limbs because it acts exactly like fire.	Now this is the description of the caustic; I have already put it in my treatise on the improvement of drugs: take of the salt of potash and quicklime, equal parts, and beat them both up well and put them into a new earthen pot, in the bottom of which you have made a small hole of a size to take a probe. Place under that pot another one, glazed. Pour enough water on the quicklime and potash to cover them to a finger's breadth after you have pressed them well together with your hand; and leave the pot until the caustic fluid has passed down into the bottom of the glazed pot. Then collect all that fluid and pour it upon a fresh lot of lime and potash.	0.87402284
Among the medications that can also be used to cauterize the hip are thapsia, honey of jujube, and lime with soap, ground together.	There are other drugs too with which the capsule of the femur is cauterized, such as Thapsia and Mel Anacardinum and inunction of lime with soap.	0.64792794
If he is not cured, then repeat the poultice after ten days, and he will be cured, God willing.	If he is not cured repeat the plaster in ten days' time and then he will be healed.	0.8295393
Know that cauterization with these medicines should not be used except after purging the body.	But you must know that no one should have cauterization with these drugs except after evacuation of the bowel.	0.7782997
Dioscorides mentioned that goat dung, if used for cauterization of sciatica, is beneficial for it, and the cauterization is done in the following manner.	Dioscorides has said that cauterization with goats' dung is beneficial for sciatica.	0.7637562
Wool is taken and soaked in old oil and placed on the deep spot between the thumb and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take dry goat dung and ignite it with fire until it becomes an ember. Then place it on the wool and leave it until it is extinguished. Then take another piece. You continue doing this until the sensation reaches the hip through the upper arm, and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called dung cauterization.	The cauterization is carried out in this manner: take wool soaked in old oil and put it into the cleft which is between the thumb and the forearm but nearer to the forearm. Then take the dried dung of a goat and expose it to fire until it glows like a coal. Place it on the piece of wool, and leave till it cools, then replace it with another, and so on until the sensation has reached the hip joint by way of the forearm, and the pain stops. This kind of cautery is called 'the dung cautery'.	0.8783878
