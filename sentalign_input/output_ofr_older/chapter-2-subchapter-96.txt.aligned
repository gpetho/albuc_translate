Cupping glasses are made of horn, brass, or glass; and cupping is done in two ways: either by pricking and drawing blood, or without pricking.

and therefore it does not weaken one, as bloodletting from a vein does; and it is not necessary for it to be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any disease that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.	What cupping does is to draw blood out of the fine vessels dispersed over the flesh; for this reason it does not cause the strength to decline as does venesection; nor may you use cupping, either with fire or without fire, in any disease due to plethora, until the whole body has been evacuated.	0.837758
And if by necessity of diseases it is necessary to cup, or by custom, we will administer it at each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at any time;	If disease or custom prescribe cupping we may apply it at any hour, at the beginning or end or middle of the month, at whatever time it may be.	0.7494081
because there are those who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;	For there are some people who, when there is an abundance of blood in them, so as to need cupping, feel heaviness and pain in the head.	0.7075524
and there are those who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and dimness in their eyes;	Some find they have a fullness and redness of the face and also of the head and neck; some have an itching in their face and forehead and a dimness and irritation in their eyes.	0.8418411
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream, and see by night blood and wounded and dead and similar things.

And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we recommend cupping after three hours of the day.	So when we see anything of this kind, and especially if it be in the middle third of the month, we thereupon prescribe cupping after the second or third hour of the day has passed.	0.73697203

and therefore it is not necessary for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold diseases in the head.	So it should not be employed on old men or on anyone suffering from a cold disease of the head.	0.8125012
And those who are often bled with it, become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cup a little lower to avoid forgetfulness.	If anyone becomes addicted to it it brings about oblivion. You should therefore bid the cupper bring the cupping-vessel a little lower down lest oblivion supervene.	0.6327847
The cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of the bloodletting of the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for the constriction of the chest, and the fissure of the bronchial tube, and cough, and repletion;	Now as to the application of cupping-vessels to the interscapular region: it is instead of venesection of the median and basilic veins; so it is effective for asthma and dyspnoea and for rupture of the organ of respiration, and for cough and plethora.	0.6399743
and it is necessary to press it lightly, because if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.	The cupping of the interscapular region should be made a little high, for if it is too low it will bring about weakness of the heart and stomach.	0.49948177

The cup on the loins is good for hemorrhoids of the anus, and diseases below, and it is necessary for the cup to be large, and made of brass, because it needs to draw well; and perhaps, if it were fine, it would break; and it makes large wounds.	The application of a single cupping-vessel to the coccyx is effective for haemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers of the lower abdomen. You must tell the cupper that the cupping-vessel should be large and of bronze, for the place requires strong suction, and a glass cupping-vessel may break; and he should scarify deeply.	0.6941534
The cups on the legs bleed openly, because they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder, and bring back the menses; and they are in place of the two saphenous veins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many situations.	Cupping applied to both legs reduces plethora manifestly, because it draws off blood from the whole body, and so is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys and uterus and bladder; and brings on the menses. It also serves for pustules and boils; and takes the place of venesection of the saphenous veins and the heel-veins. But it greatly exhausts the body and causes fainting in most people.	0.83264565
The way to apply the cup is to place it first empty, and suck lightly, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not stop doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears; then prick, and replace the cups, and be careful with the disposition of the bodies, because there are those who have tender flesh, and clear pores: then it is necessary to prick only once, and make large wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.	The way to apply the cupping-vessels: the vessel is first put in position empty; then you suck moderately; do not long hold the cupping-vessel in place, but apply it quickly and remove it quickly so that the humours gather evenly at the place; and go on doing it time after time until the place is seen to redden and to swell, and the redness of blood is manifested. Then scarify, and repeat the suction very gently; then consider the bodily condition. The person who is tender of flesh and porous of skin you should scarify once only, not more, lest the place ulcerate.	0.8661089
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to prick twice: the first time to refine the way for the thick blood.	If there be a thickness of the blood he should scarify twice; the first time to make a way out for the thinner blood and serum; and the second time to complete the extraction of the thick blood.	0.69280386
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to prick a third time; and when we want to draw a little blood, it is sufficient to prick only once.	If the blood be very turbid let him scarify a third time for completion. In general, one scarification is enough when we wish to draw a little thick blood; but if we wish to draw much blood we make more scarifications.	0.84562147
And if we want to draw a lot of blood, we repeat often; and if the blood is thick, prick deeply, and the end is that the heart is pierced suddenly,	If we judge that the blood is thick we should scarify deeply. A fair depth for the scarification is the thickness of the skin, and no more.	0.54726744

And no one should sleep after cupping.	0.87094945
and it is necessary to be cautious, when he should be cupped and when he is cupped.

The cups that are applied without pricking are those that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and on gout, and on the stomach and the abdomen and the kidneys and the hips, because those members do not tolerate pricking well,	Cupping without scarification is the cupping practised on the liver, the spleen, the breasts, the belly, the umbilicus, the region of the kidneys and the acetabulum of the femur; for these parts do not tolerate scarification.	0.69317883
and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds; to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we place cups on the stomach and the abdomen to reduce the member;	Now the purpose of the vessels is either to draw blood from one part to another, as when we apply cups over the breasts in the case of nose-bleed; or to loosen from the part a frigid vapour that has become fixed in it, as when we place cupping-vessels on the abdomen and umbilicus; for they stimulate the part and warm it and remove the pain because they loosen the vapour.	0.7607572
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or moves the stone from its place;	Sometimes they are applied over the kidneys when there is an obstruction or stones in them; for often, by virtue of their drawing, the obstruction is opened up or the stones are dislodged from their site.	0.60372806
