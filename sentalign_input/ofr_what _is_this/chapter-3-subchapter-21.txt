of the limb that is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin, it happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and was not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of excessive watering/irrigation; or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because there is little blood in the body, so it is weak.
And the treatment is that you make the patient eat, and make the body soft, so that the blood is multiplied in him; and administer a bath, and give him joy and happiness; then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment to it, and water it often with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural shape.
