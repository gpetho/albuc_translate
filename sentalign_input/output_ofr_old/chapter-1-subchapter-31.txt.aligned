Cautery is not effective for dropsy except in the manner called "ascites". When you treat it according to the methods we mentioned in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two on the back over the spine, and one on the chest; and let the cauteries be close to the thickness of the core.	The cautery is particularly effective in ascites. When you have, without effect, treated a dropsical person with the various measures mentioned in the section on diseases, you should sear with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one over the stomach, another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind his back between the vertebrae, one at the level of the breast and one at the level of the stomach; and let the burn be almost skin-deep.	0.78182685
Afterward, leave the cautery open to expel pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will come together with the help of God.	Then keep the burn open so that it suppurates for a long while. Do not let the patient, after cauterization, be without the necessary treatment, so that you combine both methods for him, and a cure will speedily come to him.	0.7547828
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the clavile that we showed earlier; and the one for the back should be olive-shaped, as mentioned earlier.	The cautery with which his belly is cauterized should be claviform like the figure previously given; while the one with which his back is cauterized should be olivary.	0.87711215
