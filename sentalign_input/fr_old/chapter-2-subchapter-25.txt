About the flesh on the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" grows on the tip of the nose, and it grows and becomes large, so that it is a noticeable thing to look at; and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then place a cautery or burning medicine on the area; and if it is delayed in cutting until it is large, then observe if it is hard, of dark color, of poor quality: do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant abscess, because when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient; and if the abscess is of soft touch, not of dark color, and you see that it can be cut completely, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and constricting substances.
