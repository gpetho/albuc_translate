of epilepsy	On cauterizing for epilepsy.	0.49934477
Epileptics should not use cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain with purgatives and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is grown and enduring enough to take medicine.	The epileptic who may be cauterized is he whose epilepsy arises from phlegm. When the patient is an adult and can stand taking the drugs, he should first purify his brain by great electuaries and the rest of the treatment mentioned in that section.	0.734899
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, make gargles and chewing that cleanse the brain often with good foods; afterward shave the head in the middle, and make a cautery as we have said before, and one cautery on the vessel, and on each corner; and if the patient is strong and enduring, make cauteries as I said for those with paralysis and weakening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped as I have said.	But if it be a boy unable to tolerate the drugs he should employ gargles and medicaments to chew, to clear his brain, for several days beforehand, with an improvement in his diet. Then let his head be shaved and burn him with the single cauterization on the middle of the head in the manner described before, and with one cauterization on the occiput, and one on each frontal prominence; and, if the patient be fit and able to bear it, add those additional cauterizations on the cervical and dorsal vertebrae that we have already described for paralysis and for flaccidity. The cautery should be olivary, the shape before described.	0.84820366
If the patient is a child, make a subtle cautery in this manner:	If the patient be a boy, use a fine cautery.	0.74083984
