On the Method of Cauterizing for Looseness of the Bowels
Chapter 35.
When there is looseness of the bowels due to cold and moisture, which weakens the stomach and intestinal retention and digestive functions, and if usual treatments fail, and the patient is strong enough to tolerate cauterization, apply a large cautery to the stomach, as previously described in stomach cauterization using a circular cautery. Apply four delicate cauteries around the navel, using a fine nail-like cautery tool, and another on the alcatin (just above the pubic bone), using a large cautery or two smaller ones.
If you see an excess of moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize over the pubic area and over each iliac crest. You may add two small cauteries on the stomach, close to the larger one.
This treatment is effective, providing reliable relief.
