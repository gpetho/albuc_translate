Chapter nineteen on cauterizing fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears in the gums' origin or in the palate or in the roots of the molars.
Then it suppurates and bursts, and the flow of pus becomes a fistula.
Then you treated it, but the treatment was not successful.
It is necessary to heat a cautery iron to the extent that it fits in the fistula.
Then insert it hot into the fistula's opening.
And hold your hand steady until the hot iron reaches its depth and end.
And do that once or twice.
Then treat it afterward with what we mentioned of treatment until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge stops, and it heals.
Otherwise, it is necessary to examine the area and remove the corrupted bone according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
