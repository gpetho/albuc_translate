of the lamprey
When you treat the lamprey disease using what we have mentioned in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three appropriate types of cautery that are all good.
Of which, one method is that you make three cauteries, or four, in a line along the length of the lamprey, following the pattern of the cautery of the liver that we have discussed before; and do not press your hand with all the cautery, and let the patient lie frequently on his back; and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two prongs, as we have shown it in the dislocation of the shoulder; and lift the skin that is around the lamprey, where the patient's side is on the left, and let the elevation by which you lift the skin be parallel to the length of the body and the cauteries be across the width of the body.
Then put the two heated prongs in until the skin is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four. And if you want, cauterize using the three-pronged cautery.
Use this treatment after the patient has expelled pus for a long time, and this is better than the other treatments mentioned before.
