When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery, which is called "olivare". (or "olive-shaped")
of which here is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are; and do not remove the hand until a third of the eyelid is burned, in the manner I have described.
