 CHAPTER FORTY-TWO.
On cauterization for pain in the back.
 Many different causes give pain in the back.
Sometimes it happens from a fall or a blow, or from excessive evacuation or the like.
It may also be due to an influx of humid matter.
Cauterization is only to be employed in this last case, which arises from an influx of cold matter.
When the patient has been purged with foetid pills or the like, he should be cauterized in his back where the pain is, over the breadth of the flat of the back, after the place has been marked with ink, with three rows of cauterizations, five in each, or more, in proportion to what you see of the patient's endurance and strength.
Use the punctate cautery.
If you like, you may give him three or four cauterizations with the middle-sized claviform cautery.
