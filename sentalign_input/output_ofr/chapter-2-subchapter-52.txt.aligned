If the appearance of the intestine comes through a wound cautery or a tear in the peritoneum, and it is on the abdomen and some of the intestines come out of it, as happens in other ruptures, or blood that flows from veins or arteries depending on what is in front, or from flatulence; and if it is through the rupture of the peritoneum and by the protrusion of the intestine, then the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and it is a mild thing without pain, and appears with various discharges.	On the treatment of protruding navel. The navel becomes prominent from many causes; either from a rupture of the peritoneum over the abdomen, so that omentum or intestine comes through it as in other ruptures; or from blood extravasation from an artery or vein, as we have mentioned; or else from wind trapped in it.	0.7462545
And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when one presses it with their fingers it goes back in, and then comes out again, and perhaps it is hard, and greatly enlarges upon entering the bath and due to strong exertion.	If it be due to ruptured peritoneum and protruding omentum, the colour of the tumour will be the same as the rest of the body; it will be soft and painless and will seem to change its position; But if it be due to an escape of bowel the change of position, compared with what we have described, will be greater, and it will disappear on digital pressure, and then will recur; and often there will be crepitus with it, and it will increase in size on entering the bath or on violent exertion.	0.6415151
And if it is due to fluid, it is a mild thing, and appears readily when you press it with your hand, and is not constrained; and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears by these signs, large and hard, and fixed in a certain quantity; and if it is due to flatulence, it is soft to the touch, and the task is for you to see if the appearance is due to blood from an artery, or from a vein, or flatulence.	If it be due to fluid, it will be soft and will not disappear on manual pressure, nor will it grow larger or smaller. If it be due to blood, then in addition to these signs the tumour will appear blackish. If it arise from a fleshy overgrowth, the tumour will be solid and hard, remaining always constant in bulk. If it be due to wind, it will be soft to the touch.	0.8066293
Then you must abandon the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.	The operation for these is to examine, and if the exomphalos be due to arterial or venous blood, or wind, you should withhold treatment since it is dangerous in these cases, with an uncertain outlook, as I taught you in the chapter on tumours arising from an artery or vein.	0.5658254
