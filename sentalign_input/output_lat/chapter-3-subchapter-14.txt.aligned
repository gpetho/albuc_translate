On the restoration of a fracture of the hip.	On setting a fracture of the femur.	0.7640889
The hip bone is often fractured and is noticeable by the way it turns inward and outward.	The femur is often broken, and this is readily discernible, for it will rotate forwards or backwards.	0.725222
Its restoration is done by binding one band above the fracture and another below it. And the patient should lie face down.	It is set by binding a bandage above the fracture and another below, while the patient lies flat on his face.	0.85249954
Then let the assistant extend each band on its side evenly, and this is done when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	Then each assistant should make an even extension in his own direction, by the bandage. This is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.	0.8032066
If the fracture is near the hipâ€™s root, then place the band on the side of the hip so that the extension goes upward, and place another band below the fracture.	But if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, you should tie on a soft bandage of wool or something similar, at the root of the thigh toward the groin, so that extension may be applied above, and another bandage below the fracture.	0.74907964
Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, then place the band close to the knee so that the extension goes downward.	Likewise if the fracture is near the knee the bandage should be near the knee, so that extension may be made downwards.	0.91295844
Then the physician should align the bone with both hands until it returns to its natural shape, and the bones should join well.	Then the doctor should straighten it out with both hands until he has reduced it to the pattern of the natural form and the bone unites neatly.	0.9012975
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a binding, if there is no swelling in the member. If swelling occurs, then leave it for a few days until the swelling subsides, then return to your treatment.	Then you will have to apply the plaster and bandage if there is no effusion in the limb, but if there is an effusion leave it for a few days until the swelling has gone down, then resume your treatment.	0.9042084
You should wrap a hard binding over the fracture, that is, a binding band, and fold it two or three times, leaving an excess. Then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel at the base of the buttocks.	As to the bandaging, you should wrap a firm broad sash two or three times round the fracture, leaving some over; then bind the leg up so that the heel is brought to reach the root of the buttock.	0.82048726
And insert a long cord between the hip and the leg near the knee downward, so that the ends of the cord emerge from the upper part of the two sides. Then wrap the excess of the binding over the thigh and hip.	Then pass a long cord in the space between the thigh and the leg, low down near the knee, and let the ends of the cord come up on either side, then bind the rest of the sash over the leg and the thigh.	0.88374364
Then place splints on the hip at the site of the fracture and place one splint on the thigh bone.	Then apply splints to the thigh at the very site of the fracture and put one of the splints on the leg-bone.	0.9376316
Then fill the gaps between the thigh and hip with soft cloths to balance the binding.	Then pack soft material in the space between the leg and the thigh to make the bandaging even.	0.8391173
Then begin a firm binding from the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps. And as you extend the bandage farther from the fracture site, let the binding be looser, softer, and gentler.	Then start with three or four turns of a strong bandage in the middle over the site of the fracture, and as you get away from the site of the fracture bind lighter and softer and looser.	0.9210515
Then tighten the two ends of the cord that you inserted between the hip and the thigh. Then tie both ends to the three splints above. Then move both ends of the cord downward until you reach the ankle of the foot. And with both, secure the ends of the splints on the other side, so that the binding does not move out of place.	Then turn to the two ends of the cord which you previously passed between the thigh and the leg, and with the cord bind the adjacent splints above, then carry the ends downward until you end up at the great tendon of the foot and with them bind also the extremities of the splints at the other end so that the bandaging will not shift from its place.	0.8765336
Then release the bandage over it while it remains, so that there does not occur corrosion, nor swelling, nor inflammation to the limb, or anything similar. But if something happens from it. Then proceed quickly with its release, and correct all that happened from it, according to what we have said many times.	Then let the bandaging remain on as long as no pruritus or abscess or effusion or anything of that sort happens to the limb; but if any of these occur loosen it quickly and put right whatever has taken place, in the manner we have often mentioned.	0.9006417
If there is a piece of bone in the bone itself that is sharp: then it is necessary that you smooth it, if it is possible for you. And if not, cut upon it and remove it, and treat it with that which was previously mentioned, until it heals.	If there be a penetrating fragment of the bone, you must reposition it if you can; but if not then cut down upon it and remove it and treat the wound in the sort of way mentioned previously, until it heals.	0.81721526
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is bound, with splints added to it, as we have said for the arm and thigh.	This fracture of the thigh is sometimes bandaged without bringing the leg alongside with splints, in the way we spoke of for the humerus and the forearm.	0.769125
However, in the restoration of it being thus fractured, limping does not happen to the patient. But if it is restored alone, without the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary that he to whom it belongs limps, always.	But setting after the former manner does not cause the patient any lameness; whereas if the femur is set alone without binding the leg to it the patient will inevitably be lame for always.	0.76931244
And know that the hip is set in fifty days, or a little more or less; all of it depends on the diversity of temperaments and other conditions.	You must know that the femur knits in fifty days or a little more or less, according to the different constitutions and other circumstances.	0.79759675
