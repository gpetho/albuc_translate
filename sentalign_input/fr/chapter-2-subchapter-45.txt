Of knots
There are many kinds of knots, of which I will describe all the types;
and now I must explain the difference between a knot and an abscess.
I say that an abscess involves heat and fever until the swelling has passed, and the suppuration is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With a knot, there is neither heat, fever, nor pain, and it contains a sac, which is its own sac and is the color of the body, and it starts like fat and becomes large;
and there are two types, either fatty or moist, and they come in many colors as I described earlier.
When you come to treat a knot, you must first test and examine it with the instrument called an "entromissoire," as its form will be shown in the chapter that follows.
And the way to investigate the abscesses of knots is to take the moistest part you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know the instrument has pierced the core, according to the size of the abscess;
then remove the "entromissoire," and observe what comes out.
If flowing moisture comes out, note its color, and make an incision as I have said for other abscesses;
and if no moisture comes out after using the "entromissoire," know that it is fatty, and make a cross-shaped incision, and take it with forceps, and gently peel it from each side and make sure to remove the sac in which it lies whole with the knot;
and if you cannot remove it whole, remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the knot will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, fill the wound with some corrosive powders, and tighten the wound, and apply things that soothe hot abscesses, and treat it with other cures until it is healed;
and if the knot is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with things that generate flesh.
and if the beating vein hinders you or something else, hasten and fill the place with powdered vitriol, and leave it tied for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the blood's boiling subsides; then return to cut what remains of the knot.
