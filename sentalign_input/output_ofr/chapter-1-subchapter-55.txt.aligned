Sometimes bumps, or stinking pustules, appear on the outer body, which come from large corrupted materials/humors.	Foul pustules sometimes arise on the body, caused by heavy corrupt frigid matter.	0.6652543
So, first, when they appear, a cautery must be made on each head of the pustule: A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose tip is set on fire, or of long birthwort root, or with a lenticular cautery.	When they first appear you should cauterize the head of each one lightly with myrtle wood whose tip has been lighted in the fire; or with the root of the long birthwort; or with the lenticular cautery.	0.7875736
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this way, and they cannot grow further from then on, but the superfluity from which they come is broken, and they are healed;	Sometimes furuncles also are cauterized in the same manner when they first arise; then they get no bigger and the superfluity originating them is dispersed and the patient is cured of them.	0.6465733
But this must be done after bloodletting.	But before you cauterize these, the patient must be depleted by bleeding.	0.631303
