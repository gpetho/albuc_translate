O, son, since I have completed for you this book, which is the last of the science of medicine,  its completion having reached its end, and through its expositions and declarations, it seems to me that I should fulfill my obligation to you with this treatise, which is a part of hand surgery, that is, surgery.
Because hand surgery is almost entirely lost in our region and in our time, so that its science is greatly diminished and its practice ceased; and nothing remains of it but some brief descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly altered and have led to errors and hesitation, so that their intentions are obscure and their power and art weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise, according to the method of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation; and so that it may come with the forms of cautery instruments and other surgical instruments, as it should be, by means of added explanation and preparation, which is necessary.
But the reason why a skilled artisan with his hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive, and its practitioner must first be practiced in the science of anatomy, which knowledge is necessary so that he knows the positions of the members and their forms, and their connections and separations; and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, and ligaments, and their number and arrangement; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their origin.
And for this reason, Hippocrates says that in name it is much, but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for whoever is not knowledgeable in what we have said concerning anatomy is liable to fall into error by which men will die, as I have seen many of them, because some are trained in this science and practice it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and inexperienced physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he incised some arteries of the neck, so that much blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who was advanced in years, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone along with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and a black slave came to him who had a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, through his ignorance, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with pads and splints with tight binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe (to heal).
And then he unbound it according to his wishes, and then he bound it again, and then he left it like that for some days and commanded that we not unbind the binding; and it remained thus until the thigh and foot were suppurated, and it came to ruin (the patient died or suffered permanent damage).
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the binding, and tranquility was achieved and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, the corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated for some days, until the malignancy of it was magnified by its lord (the infection worsened significantly).
The reason is that the burning cancer is pure melancholic humor, therefore it should not be approached with iron at all, but rather it should be in a limb which can be completely amputated (or otherwise entirely removed).
And therefore, son, it is necessary for you that the operation by hand be divided into two parts: that is, into an operation which is associated with health, and into a work in which there is peril in the most favorable conditions (or, "...in the best of circumstances").
And I have already explained this in every part of this book where an operation occurs that involves error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to observe this and leave that, so that fools do not find a way to speak and dishonor you.
Therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and laudable success, and avoid terrible diseases of difficult healing, and abstain from those things that make you fear, so that hesitation in your faith and in your name does not overcome you: for it is more lasting for your glory, and higher in the world and in the hereafter for your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician".
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter deals with the head, down to the feet, the forms of instruments and the cautery irons, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, of incisions and perforations, and of cupping glasses, and of wounds, and of the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, of restoration and of dislocations, and of the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and of the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I say the quality of the benefits of that cautery and of the harms from it, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and the harm from it is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and already a great multitude of wise men have spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and a little of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, which are with matter or without matter, except for two complexions, which are hot complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to that, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not convenient in a disease which is by quality and by dryness, because the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry disease should be healed with that which is hot and dry.
And I refute those who say the contrary, that benefit is done by cautery in every hot and dry disease that comes to the bodies of men, because when you compare the body of man and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say, concerning this discourse, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that this should apply to someone who is already experienced and practiced in the chapter on cautery from prior exercise, and who has recognized the diversity of the complexions of men and the disposition of the diseases themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and the duration of those diseases.
But in other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid diseases, because all doctors are agreed on those, and are not in disagreement about the benefit of cautery in those.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness, is superior to cautery with a burning medicine, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is cauterized, and does not harm another member near it except with slight harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches even those members which are distant from it, and quickly brings about in the member a disease of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except insofar as it is superfluous. And it is known to us through experiment and long service of study in the art concerning the truth of the causes; and for that reason I am excused from the length of discourse. And if it were not that it is not appropriate for my book to pause here, I would reveal to you the secret of fire, and the quality of its operation in the body and of its expulsion whereby it expels diseases, with philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be burdensome for your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree about the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, placing springtime as the best time.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by accidental timing is overwhelmed by the benefit that is obtained with cautery, and especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong, and sudden pains, which do not permit delay because it is feared that greater harm will come from waiting than the slight harm incurred due to timing.
And this, my sons, is not understood except by the vulgar populace and foolish physicians, namely that there is no appropriate time for a disease that is healed by cautery, and they base this on that consequence.
And the cause is not as they believe it to be, for cautery is nothing but a kind of medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, cautery is superfluous over other medicine because of the speed of its effectiveness and the power of its action and the greatness of its Lord (i.e., its efficacy is so great that it renders other medicine unnecessary).
And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, depending on the patient's constitution and the location of their illness, and their strength, and what is prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities within them, and what has reached them through their intake of food and similar causes; unless the illness to which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a limb with few superfluities and humors, such as cautery of a tooth for pain and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this happens rarely.
And a more common saying is that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and this is a correct saying, not in the sense that they understand it, for they believe that it is a cure that does not benefit from medicine or any other means besides cautery itself.
And the reason is the opposite; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer methods of treatment for certain illnesses, and those medicines do not work, and then, at the end of the process, cautery is administered, and it is beneficial in that case. And therefore, from this we see that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and the many foolish physicians.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the evenness of gold and the excellence of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not scar, although this is not absolutely true, for I have already proven this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies and not others, and cautery with this is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you perform cautery with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is ignited according to the quantity you want, because of the hardness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply too much fire to it, the gold melts from the fire, and some of the lamina falls into the fire, so that the craftsman is distracted by this.
And for this reason, cautery with iron is done more easily and more quickly to a correct operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head to the feet, so that I might easily find what is needed.
The first chapter.
This cauterization counteracts the humidity and coldness on the brain, the accidents of which are caused by two things: that is, the cause of profuse and multiple rheumatic flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleep, and toothache and sore throat, and universally any illness that comes from cold, such as paralysis, swooning, and apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with laxative medicine, cleansing the head, for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the patient, their age, and their constitution.
And then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit between your hands on a square bench and have him place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the bridge of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that place, mark that spot with ink, and then ignite the olive cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [cautery] on the spot marked with ink, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand is gradually tightened, and you turn it.
And then lift your hand lightly and examine the place, and if you see some quantity of the bone uncovered, like the amount of a grain of barley, then lift your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron [cautery], with another of those, if it is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the place and leave it for three days.
And then place on it cotton soaked in vinegar and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. And then treat the place with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And it is said that when the wound remains open, it heals better, for that is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the bone marrow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's thickness is hardened.
And then scrape away what is burned from the bone, and then let it heal.
And others say that with the cautery, penetrate to the back, until it first reaches the strong part of the bone, until the bone cracks, and this is the form of a small ulcer: And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then let it be healed until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a matter of fear; and leave that, it seems to me, better is health, when it is; for the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, as we have testified in the other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and use that, and with that work towards health.
Chapter two.
Of the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs throughout the head in a patient, and he uses cupping, leeches, purges, plasters, ointments, poultices, and similar remedies, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we describe and none of those things benefit him, then consider whether the patient's head is of a strong constitution by nature; and if it is not cold and finds great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery a little below the previous one. And then cauterize that above the temple of his head with a cautery until the scab is formed. Incise the scab and uncover the bone to the extent that we have described, and cauterize that with a cautery in the posterior part of the head in the place which is called the vessel — and this is the place where a cupping glass is applied. And lighten your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient because of this finds much greater pain, different from the pain of all other cauterizations of the head.
And I say that this cautery in its place, because it is necessary that the cautery with which the temples of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter three.
On the cauterization of recent migraine.
When a sharp pain occurs in the head, or a prolonged pain extends to the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the sections on diseases; and if all this does not help, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and peel it, and cut off its extremities from both ends. Then incise the place of the pain in the temple with a lancet, until a space is made under the skin, so that it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a compress to cause constriction, and leave it for three hours; then unbind it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, and then apply a cotton ball soaked in vinegar until the area becomes inflamed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner:  heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
and it is called a nail or peg, because its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle part of it there is a small eminence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the cauterized area which is underneath is not burned further — and rotate the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount that is burned by the sharpness of the cautery is as much as half of it, raise your hand so that the artery which is underneath is not burned, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; and then place cotton soaked in wine on it, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of a knife as with a cautery, and be careful not to cut an artery in this particular, not-ancient, migraine.
Chapter four.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic migraine.
When you treat migraine with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes because of the illness what we have said about the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire is insufficient, then you should heat the knife-cautery until it is white-hot, then mark the location of the pain with a line whose length is half the length of a finger, or something like that; and place your hand for a moment and press until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle is not injured and the nerve which moves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the guarding and caution of the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, for in its incision there is danger, and especially to him who is ignorant of what he does and is not studious and experienced; and leaves the operation to him at the beginning.
And I will come with a reminder of the treatment of accidental blood flow from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if sometimes this illness is not alleviated by this cautery and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize that in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of arteries with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatments which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is what is called a puncture, of which this is the form:
And then puncture, then apply the cautery, and let it be moved around the whole ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is in a specific area. Extend the cautery from the root of the ear little by little, after you have marked the area with a probe.
And if the cautery requires ten punctures in the whole ear, or in a part of it, then subsequently treat the areas until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of a sprain/twist.
A sprain, which is cured with cauterization, is only one of the types that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the classifications of diseases.
Avoid cauterization of the type that occurs due to dryness or spasm of the nerve.
When you treat this type of sprain with leeches, purgatives, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because softening (or alleviation) only comes to the part that appears healthy.
And the method of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the ear, a little above the corner of the head, and another at the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the finger, and keep your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the  fingernail is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, the shape of which is shown above/previously. However, it is more subtle to do it a little like this; and it is necessary to cut away some superfluous thickness.
And then care for the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
On the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you have treated it with what we have said, and your medication is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries: on all the corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the nape of the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is also cauterized above the stomach; and it is better behind; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
On cauterization for forgetfulness done by flame.
So that large enemas and purifying pills are given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply to their neck a plaster of cetre described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cautery. And do this according to the same order which I have already mentioned.
And therefore if he is healed by these means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauteries on the back of his head, which descend from the highest part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. And place between each cautery the width of a finger, and then treat the cautery with what has been prescribed.
But if you add to it and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize in the middle of the place; and if you wish a greater addition, then cauterize that upon the two horns (presumably referring to two points flanking a central point).
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form previously given.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
That you proceed in the purification of the head with leeches and with what we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns (presumably points) of the head, and with a cautery on the back part of it, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to treat it, and the patient is tolerant and the illness is severe, then cauterize with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is burned from the tailbone, and raise your hand. And then care for it until it is healed, and this should be an olive oil cautery.
Chapter 10.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
An epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is caused by phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatment which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and tolerant of the expulsion of medicines.
And if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, beforehand for many days, with improvement of the diet.
Then shave the patient's head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on the occiput, and cauterize on each temple. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let it be an olive-shaped cautery as previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small/fine cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
On the cauterization of melancholy.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize that with the cauteries which we have mentioned in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is a superfluity tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has been described previously in the division (of treatments).
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a decent-sized poultice for him on a circular cloth, and then place that in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and held securely on all sides.
Then apply a liniment; and it is most worthy to use old sheep's fat (or tallow). And heat that (liniment) over the fire with moderate warmth, which the said sufferer will feel when it is applied to him. Then pour that (liniment) into the middle of his head within the circle, and let it remain there until it is cold.
And do this to the patient once a week, along with his other treatment, until he is healed; or, if you wish, cauterize that (area) making small punctures according to his need, provided that you hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a type of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in sheep's fat or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the onset of water in the eye is apparent to you, through the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink which will purify his head, and protect it from all humidity.
And make him sweat in a bath of some kind for several days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and also cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the onset of the flow of water is in both eyes, or on one side if the onset of the water is in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the hairline; and let the cauterizations be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with any medicine which is available to you.
And I come with skill which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of these and the control of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed far apart.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears (or, Concerning the cauterization of chronic fistulas/ulcers).
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest location on the outside of the head, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we recounted in the beginning chapter concerning water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it needs additional treatment, then cauterize it at the end of the eyebrow above the outer canthus of the eye with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or, Concerning cauterization for a foul-smelling nose).
When you treat this with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then you prepare and give the patient the decoctions for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium-sized olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize it with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauteries above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair.
And beware of the artery, that you do not burn it.
And this is the shape of the clove-shaped cautery.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the cauterization for the softening of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize that, do so a little above the two eyebrows with two cauteries on each side, and let them be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too hard with the cautery, but only enough that a third part of the eyelid is dried/cauterized.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inward and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inward so that they prick the eye, cauterization in those cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either with fire or with a burning medicine.
If you cauterize it with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave his eyelashes like those who cleanse them, until they are elongated and even; and if they prick from their roots, then bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not irritated until the hairs have grown back.
Then, when they are grown back and even, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with a probe, with a mark that is in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then apply cotton soaked in egg white or in a mucilage of ptils (likely referring to a type of plant) over the eye.
And then ignite the cautery, of which this is the form.
And then cauterize over the marked figure, little by little, in several times, until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf, is completely burned.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and its hairs raised above the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it like that for three days, and then apply cotton with a bandage until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the hairs near their root and the eyelid is softened, then apply the cautery again in the same way as you did initially.
But if the hairs are below the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even, and the hairs do not touch the eye.
But cauterize with a burning medicine; this is that you instruct the patient to pull the hairs until they are elongated and even, and then a myrtle leaf-shaped piece of linen is applied.
Then take known soap and quicklime, about one ounce, or thereabouts, and mix these ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; and then spread this on the linen which is made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place this over one or both eyes; and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it slightly, but do not move it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like that of fire.
And when you perceive that he feels the bite, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger; when the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then consider whether you see that the eyelid is now raised as if it were cauterized with fire or with incision, for then it is well; and if not, return some of the medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet reached and it does not blacken until your operation is even and the eye is contracted.
Then place cotton with a bandage on it until the scab from the cauterization is removed, and then treat it with healing ointment or with something else until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to guard with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid is softened after a few days and some of the hairs pierce the eye, then repeat your medicine on the place where the eyelid is softened, precisely as you did at the beginning, and then cure it until it is healed.
And this is the method for myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men are diversified according to their size and smallness, and therefore your cauterization is done accordingly.
And the right way will not be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the lacrimal duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not successful, then you should cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place his head on your lap, and have a minister hold his head between your hands in such a way that his head is not moved or agitated.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or gum arabic on his eye.
Then heat the cautery, which is shaped like this:
which should be concave, like the shape of a reed or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other end. And if you want, let it be shaped like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the rottenness from it.
Then place the cautery, which should be well ignited, upon it; and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand may not wander or the patient be disturbed. Then place the cautery on the granulation of the eye and burn it away.
And so, if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it thus for three days, and then place upon it cotton with a bandage and surround it with drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then place a sharp, corrosive medicine upon it until the bone is uncovered and is scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula, which some earlier physicians described:  Attend to the location of the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a fine, thin tube, which is shaped like this:  And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of melted lead; and hold your hand with a clamp with good retention, and let not the patient be moved so that the melted lead does not reach his eye; and it is necessary that you place upon the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or water, because the lead will adhere to the location of the fistula and heal it by a marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said of the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to administer a probe through the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose as it will come to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
On the cauterization of the fissure of the wells (likely referring to fistulas or similar openings).
Many times fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment does not help, then apply a small, knife-like cautery according to this form that is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the thinness of a knife.
Then carefully place that instrument in those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
And then treat that with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula is formed, and then you treat it and the treatment is not effective, then you should apply a cautery according to the size of the fistula. Then place this heated cautery into the opening of the fistula, holding your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and then do this once or twice, afterwards; and then treat that with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
And so, if the wound is excised and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, as will be described in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of teeth and the softening of gums.
When the gums are softened by humidity and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and they do not help, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery, the shape of which will be described below, in such a way that you place the small spatula on the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold your hand a little until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization a few times as needed.
And then let the patient rinse their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is fixed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupted humidity is dried out.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or there is cold or a worm in it, and you do not obtain a cure with medicine, then cauterize it in one of two ways: either cauterize with a cow's horn, or cauterize with fire.
Cauterization with a horn is that you take a cow's horn and boil it in a pan, and then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a probe, and then dip it in the boiling horn, and place it on the aching tooth quickly until it is cooled.
And then repeat this several times until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge wool or cotton in the aforementioned boiling horn, and place that on the aching tooth, and place a glowing iron on top of it until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth's cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is that you take a small rod of brass or iron, and that there is some thickness in its middle so the sharpness of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then heat the cautery to the desired shape, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be relieved either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, by the application of that cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good broth and hold it for an hour, then spit it out; and this is the form of the cautery.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophulos.  (Extrophulos likely refers to some kind of external growth or lesion.)
When extrophulos are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not amenable to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them mildly, then ignite the cautery, the shape of which is as follows: having two open ends so that smoke escapes from one end of the cautery, and place this ignited instrument on that abscess once, and again if it is needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in wine over it until what the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of hoarseness and constriction of the throat.
When humidities come upon the lung passage, and especially when this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and afterwards cauterize below the root of the throat in the depressed area.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn his windpipe, only a little.
And cauterize that with another cautery near the juncture of the neck at his last vertebra. And his cautery should be a nail, following the previous manner.
And afterwards, treat that with what has been previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has neither fever nor consumption [tuberculosis], and the illness is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle in the previously mentioned places, left and right; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the previous form.
And if you wish, let your cauterization be punctate with the cautery that is called a punctate cautery, the form of which precedes in the punctation of earache.
And let the points be close to those; and then treat it with the same things that were previously prescribed until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with this: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the titillic, which is the head of the penis.
When the head of the penis is dislocated due to lubricous humors and is not fixed in the time of its return from its dislocation until that which is accustomed to returning is located there, and then by a small movement it is dislocated again as it should be, as we have testified, then it is necessary that you first reduce the dislocation, and then the patient should be turned on his back or on his side; and then elevate the glans which is in the inner part of the penis to the outer parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated to the inner parts.
And then heat the cautery having two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the glans until it penetrates from one side to the other; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place on the cautery cooked pork with salt, and then keep the patient calm, and the limb should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened and the humidity is removed and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
Concerning the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors enter the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying within it, and if you continue the methods of cure and do not succeed, then the patient should lie on his back, extend his arms and legs, and then cauterize him with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, the length of a finger, with a nail-shaped cautery, and two cauteries below on either side of the cautery, so that a triangular figure of cauteries is formed; and space them so that they do not touch, which would cause rotting.
And if the depth of the cautery is two-thirds the thickness of the finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery according to the form of a circle, according to this form:  (The phrase implies diagrams were present in the original text to show the shapes of the cauteries).
And let the stomach be cauterized, paying attention to what is feared from this cauterization: and it is that you mark on the stomach points according to the quantity you wish with a probe, and then cauterize these points with the cautery; and then treat it with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
Of the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, or humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is expelled from its normal state by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it doesn't help, then it is necessary that the patient lie supine on their back, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same quantity on the liver under the hypochondria, where the recumbent position of a man allows. (Again, implies accompanying diagrams)
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of the right index finger.
And do not press too hard with the cautery.
And if the quantity of what is burned is the quantity of half the thickness of a finger, and no more; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him be lying down, having his thighs extended, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-shaped cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And be careful not to cauterize excessively, and let the thickness of a whole finger be burned so that the entire body is burned and reaches the intestines, because the finger here is thin; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the perforation of a liver abscess with a cautery.
When a wound or abscess develops in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient experiences heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is very sharp and sometimes it fatigues the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be positioned on their side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then ignite the cautery, which is shaped like a rake, the form of which was described on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until all the pus is consumed, until it reaches the bottom, until healthy matter emerges.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this form of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many illnesses have been treated; but let someone with some experience sometimes dare this operation, however, leave it to us, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy, according to this manner, is effective, and it is this: that you take a long, dry root of birthwort, one finger in length, which is found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with a cautery in that place which is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the chin, slightly leaning towards the part which is below the beard, and with two cauteries in that which is leaning between the fifth and sixth ribs, leaning slightly towards the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another above the stomach, and with three cauteries on the back; and with one cautery in that place which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you grasp your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be in the manifest action of the handle.
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray, and ignite it, and put it in that place which is between the ribs, until it reaches that abscess and is thoroughly healed, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with cautery there is danger, because you might kill him immediately in the fistula site, to which there is no healing.
Chapter 30.
Of the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said about treatment in the division and you do not succeed in your treatment, then cauterization is appropriate in three ways, all of which are correct. One of these is to make three or four cauteries lengthwise, according to the length of the spleen, following the pattern of the liver cauteries, the form of which has been described previously.
And let the width between each cautery be that of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we have described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not compress with your hand over the cautery; and let the patient be lying on their side.
And another way of cauterization is to ignite the cautery having two prongs, which method we have described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the rib which is in the area of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And let your elevation, with which you raise the rib, follow the length of the body, so that cauteries are made according to the width of the body.
And then insert the two prongs, very hot, into that space so that with them you penetrate the rib from the other side.
And then extract the cautery; and thus four cauteries are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three prongs.
And then you treat the cauterization once it has stopped oozing pus for several days, for this is more important than the other preceding actions in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical patient.
Cauterization is not used in dropsy except in a certain specific circumstance.  (The "3" after alcinte is likely a scribal error or annotation.)
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division and your treatment is ineffective, then it is necessary that you cauterize them with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery above the stomach, and with another cautery above the liver, and with another cautery above the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery above the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
And then leave the cauterization open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the patient from treatment near the cauterization with what is necessary, so that two intentions are added to it, and healing is hastened with assistance. (This sentence is somewhat ambiguous and could benefit from further context to be fully understood. The "two intentions" likely refers to two therapeutic aims.)
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its form is described above.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the dorsum of the foot, in the space between the little and ring fingers. Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand again, and do not completely withdraw it, because the yellowish water will flow out.
The cautery should be of this shape: Then make two cauterizations on the two thighs, and on each thigh, let the cauterization be done with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh; one below the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh, two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that some water may drain from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
On the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is afflicted by cold and humidity which weakens its functions – that is, the digestive and retentive functions which are located in the stomach and intestines – and this is treated with methods of healing and does not improve, and sometimes the patient suffers, exhibiting a need for cauterization, then cauterize that area with a large cautery over the stomach as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four small cauteries in a circle around the navel, with a thin, pointed cautery; and with cautery on the hypochondrium, above the large intestine, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize the area over the pubic bone and over the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries over the stomach and near the inguinal regions, for this is a perfect cure and a helpful treatment, in which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
On the cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When there are chronic hemorrhoids, or those caused by thick cold humors or corrupted humors, and they are treated with what we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not help, then cauterize with three cauteries below the lowest vertebra of the sacrum, small and triangular, and with a cautery above the navel, near two fingers breadth.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on the spleen, using a nail-shaped cautery; and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the cauterization of athel and their excision.  (Note: "athel" likely refers to a type of growth or swelling; the precise meaning would require further context within the medical treatise.)
When you excise athel, then immediately apply a cautery that resembles a ray. (Again, "athel" is unclear without more context, but it seems to refer to a growth or lesion.) Then insert that ignited cautery into the excised athel, and finally place your hand there until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice, for if the athel are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat them with ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is more difficult to heal.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the cauterization of fistulas which are formed unnaturally in the parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the treatment we have recommended, and the patient is distressed by this, let it be treated with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in an unnatural location, and it is old, with pus and corrupted humidity, then what is most fitting is to probe it with a thin probe, and then ascertain the extent of its depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery iron, which resembles a ray (or rod). Then insert that ignited cautery into the fistula, according to the depth indicated by the probe.
And repeatedly apply the cautery until those corrupted parts are burnt, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it is not penetrating (deeper vital structures).
Then care for the area until it is healed.
And if the area is sealed, and the materials have been excised from it, and it remains so for a long time, then know that it is completely healed.
And if the materials have not been removed, then know that it is penetrating or the bone underneath is corrupted, or this comes from those causes which will be mentioned in their place (later in the text).
Chapter 37.
On the cauterization of ulcers.
When in ulcers pain arises from cold or excessive windiness, and because of this the patient's flesh is diminished, then it is necessary that you cauterize that above the ulcers with a cautery on each ulcer with a nail-shaped cautery, the details of which were previously mentioned.
And quickly cauterize again a little lower, so that three linear cauteries result, and then they will be more helpful in healing.
Chapter 38.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that in the lowest part above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubis begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the walnut; and cauterize that with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped one, as is appropriate/customary.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the breast.
When cold and humidity come to the breast, and because of this conception is prevented, and her menses are corrupted, and their provocation is delayed, and pain occurs at the time of their arrival, then it is necessary that the place be cauterized with three cauteries in the circumference of the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery above the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it protrudes.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the area as it is swollen, so that the area falls within the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind previously described in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at hand, then cauterize that area with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be made according to the amount of the swelling of the entire hip; and then care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, the patient is treated with what we have said and do not disagree, and this is ancient practice, then it is necessary that you purge the patient of thick humors with foul-smelling pills or with artificial or similar pills; and then cauterize that area.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
Now, according to two known methods, one of which is that you cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space between each cautery be the size of a finger's breadth, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be in the middle of the area, on the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of hip dislocation, that is, let it be a continuous circle and burn the thickness of the entire hip.
And this is the method of cauterization for sciatica when the pain is confined to the hip and does not extend to the thigh.
But if it extends to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the place where the patient indicates the pain; and with one cautery on the groin, four fingers slightly below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-shaped, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the hip.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-shaped cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not go so deep with the cautery as to burn nerves or large arteries, lest this cause the patient harm, such as numbness or contraction.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle and went too deep in the cauterization, and the leg swelled until the tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong bowel movement occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places simultaneously, cauterize each according to this manner.
And the wise ones say that in the cauterization of the ankle, the cautery should be like this: make a circle of iron whose circumference is half a palm; and let its opening be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a walnut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those rings be one or two nuts, and make in those margins of iron decently prepared in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the ankle, the patient lying on their side. And then cauterize it with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave it for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: O, son, of this type of cautery we have used little because of the fear of its appearance, and because we have found few who look upon it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with it the place of it.
But cauterization with burning medicines is that you make two circles having a perforated handle in which the iron tool fits; let the length of the walls in the height of them be two nuts or whatever they are.
And if the space which is between each one is the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and they are open below and above, and they are such that they contain themselves between them according to this form:
Then place it over the part of the anus, the patient lying on their side, and press your hand on the part of the anus; then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and the quality of that should be with small fire little by little, and hold that for the amount of one hour, and let the patient suffer the biting and burning of it — for that produces a burning like fire — until the biting ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the whole anus with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and place a poultice on it until the blackness of the burn is softened, and leave it for some days, and pus will drain from it; this is the final cure.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make for him a bath that contains water, as was done for the anus similarly.
And this is the manner of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, an equal part of each, and crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that will enter the rectum.
And place under the bottom of the pot another inverted pot, and pour over the alkali and quicklime fresh water which covers them by a finger's breadth, and after you compress them with your hand by good compression, and let the sharp water descend from it into the inverted pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be of very strong acidity, which is used in many medical operations and in cauterization of other members, because it acts like fire.
And some medicines with which it is also cauterized are, for example,  thrice-boiled honey and quicklime with soap, mixed together.
And Galen recounted the operation and cure of a pain in the hip and sciatic vein from an ancient man, and greatly praised the effectiveness of this remedy, saying that it needed no other cure, because he was healed at once as he recounted, for he quickly entered a bath and immediately was free of it.
And it is that fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be pounded very well with a little fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and it should be bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels a lessening of the burning.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that it is not fitting that anyone use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But Dioscorides says that when the varicose vein is cauterized with a goat's hoof, it benefits him greatly; and the cautery should be done in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes and the ankle.
Then take a dry goat's hoof and burn it in the fire until it is made into charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is extinguished. And then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of burning reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this manner of cautery is called cautery of hooves.
Chapter 42.
Of the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth from various causes, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, by infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable in that single instance which is caused by an effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with purging pills and similar remedies,  make incisions on the tooth where the pain is, three lines according to its width, then mark with a tentha in each line 5 cauterizations or more, according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries using a nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter 43.
Concerning cauterization at the beginning of a gibbosity (or hump).
Often this illness happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs on their frame in the wing (possibly referring to the shoulder blade or scapula) with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And therefore when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in all parts of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the pointed cautery, two or three lines. And let the points be close together.
And then care for the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered to a swelling caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is customarily called gout by physicians.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold [humors] is treated with a method of cure and the pains are not relieved, then cautery relieves them.
And it is so that you cauterize that area for evacuation in the circumference of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains ascend to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize and do not press too hard with your hand with the cautery beforehand; let it only be around the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains ascend to both knees, then administer the cautery which we have mentioned in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands, and it is called "suagra" (likely a type of hand ailment), then puncture in the circle of the veins as they intertwine; puncture in those two lines.
And if the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the circle of the veins on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains rise to the hips or muscles in a few days, then cauterize them in every part of the affected areas.
And do not deprive the patient of good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, pushing the intestines in front of the testicle, and this is beginning to happen, then you should order the patient to stop eating that day and to use soothing remedies so that the tear in their abdomen subsides.
Then hold the patient between your hands over his back, and instruct him to hold his breath until the testicle or the intestine is expelled or appears.
Then return that [the intestine/hernia] with your fingers and gently push the rupture against the pubic bone, noting that the extremity should resemble a half-circle in the superior parts of the body.
Then heat the cautery, whose form is as follows:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and another servant should be at their legs, and another at their feet, who should hold their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach the bone of the pubis in the middle of the perineum; and repeat this another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And carefully observe the protrusion of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest death or other great harm befall the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your operation is not successful.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small, according to their size and measure.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a poultice, until the burn scar is healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and the wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you give him nourishment according to the length of his treatment, which will cleanse his belly, and that the intestine does not protrude due to the effort of healing.
And then, when he wants to get up after about forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be moderate in work, in the fullness of food and drink, and in loud voices, for when he uses this entire regimen of healing, he will be completely healed.
And I will tell you the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen; and if, at the beginning, you want them to stop bleeding, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let what is excised from the wound be like a third of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is appropriate.
And some earlier authors said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed through the width at the highest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion.
When pain develops in some member due to a fall or percussion, and that pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be appropriate to each member according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains to be punctuated from one member to the next nearest member, so that it is necessary to treat those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes treated with cautery with great benefit, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, if you want to cauterize a leper, consider if the leprosy is spreading and is not cured by what we have said in the division, and we fear that the corruption will spread throughout the patient's body and complexion. Then cauterize the patient's head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and a second below that, towards the forehead at the hairline; and two on either side of the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck or the cervicals.
And finally, with the cautery, press gently so that a small impression is made on the bone, and the crusts are loosened, so that the exhalation of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize on the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy is already spread over the patient and manifestly apparent, then you should cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned for the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the vertebrae near the coccyx, and one on the coccyx, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the knees and one on each knee, and with two on the ankles, and with two on the muscles of the calves and two on the tendons of the feet; and cauterize on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of the feet, and on the knuckles of the hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the heel, so as not to burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you apply, the more helpful and beneficial it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they do with wounds, because their body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the types of instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
On cauterization of stupor (or numbness).
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you should cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes a numbness affecting the hands and feet, and the vertebrae of the back, is cauterized near the emergence of the nerves which supply that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except one who is skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and the course of the nerves throughout the moving body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of albaras, which is morphea.
When albaras is chronic and you apply none of the medicinal ointments to it, then cauterize it with a cautery iron slightly, according to the size and nature of the lesion, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and arugula leaves, and with pigeon blood or hen blood, of each an equal part and all mixed together, and then spread it on a cloth and apply it to the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you wish to remove it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its circumference as it is spread.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron in the middle; but this is not my practice, for I fear that it will become ulcerated, and I have seen this happen several times.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle as we have said, or with many cauteries.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the cauterization of a boil.
When a boil is slow to mature, and this is due to the superfluity causing it, or to the age of the patient—because they are old and decrepit, with little blood—or due to the season, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the boil; then cauterize around its circumference with many small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the form: and place it in the middle of the boil until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in that place where there is pus, so that the body of the boil is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On the cauterization of corrosives.
A corrosive is a corruption that travels in the limb, which corrodes it as fire consumes dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then you should apply many small, or large, hot cautery irons, according to what is appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it entirely until you eradicate all the corrosion and none of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and apply crushed sulfur mixed with oil to the cauterized areas until the scabs are all gone and all the corruption is removed.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days you see that healthy flesh has grown where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cautery on what remains in the corrupted areas.
And sometimes a corrosive is medicated with a sharp medicine, for that acts in place of cautery. But however, cautery with fire is of quicker help.
And I have already described the treatment of it with sharp medicine in the section, and therefore take that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
Of the cauterization of wounds and other similar things.
Many times, a disease called a wound happens in the parts below the foot, and it is a large, penetrating wound which injures the foot; and cauterization in these cases is according to two methods, that is cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is that you heat a concave cautery similar to a vulture's beak, which is made of iron according to the size which contains the entire wound, and it should be of fine edges.
And then place that heated instrument on the wound, and then move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the wound until the cautery reaches the depth of the wound. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed pus. And then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
And then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it does not heal, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should apply cautery with water to those areas.  Take a small tube of bronze or iron or a vulture's quill, and place it over the wound; then pour a small amount of hot water into the tube, and hold your hand, and move it with the compression of your whole hand, and press the edge of the tube into the root of the wound, and the hot water will find its way to the bottom of the wound; and let the patient endure the bite of the hot water for a short time, about an hour, and then remove it, for the wound with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this to those [wounds] and then to the others until you have treated all of those that are in the body.
And then treat those sores, once the roots of the wounds are eradicated, with those ointments which generate flesh.
Chapter 54.
On the cauterization of tremor.
When someone experiences tremor due to cold in the nerves, or due to a fever of a cold origin, or due to a similar cause, then you should cauterize him with four or five cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, between each vertebra with one cautery; and with a cautery on his feet, and on his stomach, with an olive-shaped cautery.
And his tremor will subside, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 55.
On the cauterization of accidental whiteness in the body.
When in the body there appears whiteness, and there are pustules and fissures which are made of thick, corrupted matter; then at the beginning, when it appears, it should be cauterized on the head of the fistula with a thin cautery with myrtle wood, the tip of which is extended with fire; or with a long root of erestologia; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes cauterization is also suitable at the beginning of its expulsion according to this manner; and they are not believed, and the superfluity is disrupted by doing this, and heals from those.
However, it is necessary that this be done near evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of a blood flow accident due to an arrow wound.
Often, there is a flow of blood from an arrow wound that is incised near the wound, which flows outwardly, or from the incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and similar, and it is difficult to stop that.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you press with your hand on the orifice of the arrow wound, and place your finger over it tightly many times until the flow of blood stops under your finger, and it does not come out.
Then, put small and large olive cauteries in the fire, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
Then take one of those, small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery is broken, on that vein quickly after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery until that blood is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from those which are prepared in the fire, and do not cease to do this one after the other until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop it in those cases, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or with extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted, the extremities are better cauterized and the blood is stopped, or that it be tied with thread or with a ligature by strong constriction, or that medicines whose virtue is to stop blood be placed on it; and they are tightened with a cushion with a decent constriction.
But he who administers a decent restriction with a ligature and with constriction with cloths or by the application of burning substances and similar things, does not do so quickly.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently place the index finger on the orifice of that vein as we have said, and apply great pressure to it until the blood is stopped from the main part of the wound, and the finger should not be moved from the artery; and over the artery let cold water of very great coldness be sprinkled until the blood is congealed and thickened; and then consider what need there is of cautery or medicine.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire is suitable and with burning medicine, and the occasions and causes thereof, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the top of the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one who seeks this will be relieved, then on that which he will have asked.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter is what is in the first chapter on cauterization, but for terror. (or "...but in a frightening way").
And because it is necessary that there be great caution in it, for in the operation which is in this chapter many times there is an evacuation which is with blood with which life remains, because of the opening of a vein or incision on the abscess or opening of an exit or purification of the wound or extraction of an arrow or incision of a stone and their like. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in the worst of them, death.
And I warn you that this hesitation should not fall upon you, for sometimes you will encounter men with many kinds of diseases. And of them there is someone who is angry with his illness and death is light for him, and this because of the vehemence of what he finds in his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness is fear which signifies death.
And of those there is one who gives you his wealth and says, you hoping for his health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to that which comes to you of which this manner is; and let your caution be greater than covetousness and your greed; and do not presume any cause about this except through certain knowledge which verifies this for you, and to which follows praiseworthy success.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that is to you help towards acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and glory.
O, sons, may God inspire in you His understanding and not hinder your direction and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that this which you ask for and of which you have need may be alleviated for you.
Chapter One.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth and when the nurse compresses the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is not known.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and in all those whom I saw, death followed, and thus it is in my view a fatal condition in them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could not support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either accumulated between the skin and the bone, or it is accumulated under the bone on the scalp.
Because if in this case the humidity is between the skin and the bone and the abscess is small, then you must make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in width, and let the length of the fissure be about two nuts so that the humidity can drain, and this is the form of a spatula:
And therefore, if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there should be two incisions in this manner:
And if the humidity is under the bone, the sign of it is that you see the sutures of the head opened on all sides, and the water is squeezed out when you compress it with your hand on the inner parts, and this is not hidden from you. You must make an incision in the middle of the head with three fissures in this manner:
And then extract all the humidity from the incision; and then bind the incisions with cloths and lint; and then swab it with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little humidity until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appears, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the collection of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood, and the patient dies from that flow of blood with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Second.  (or Chapter Two)
When someone develops cataracts or rheum in the eyes or feet, and this is chronic, and medicinal cures do not work, then the final cure for this is incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise them, have the patient shave their head, and then rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then constrict the patient's neck with a cloth; and then consider where the vein pulses; and the location of each [artery] in the areas near the ears is compressed, and thus they are hidden except in some men.
And then mark the artery with an ink pen, and then incise each one with the sharp point of a scalpel, making an incision reaching to the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery and sever it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two fingers' breadth, because when a vein is incised, the blood exits with a pulsating flow, which spurts out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three fingers' width, and then mark it with ink, and cut to the bone.
And the amount of blood that needs to be let is about six ounces, and quickly let more or less, and all this is according to the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any fragment of the splinter remains on the bone, then excise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
Then bind the wound tightly with lint and linen bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrid humors and a diseased quality in the tissues of the temples, or a severe and similar chronic condition, and treatment with medicinal methods fails, then in these illnesses we should attempt extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization, as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hair which is on the temples; and attend to the artery appearing in the temple, for it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden only in few men by the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with warm water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then put in it [the artery] a hook and draw it to the upper parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are beneath it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the hook, and then incise a part of it according to the quantity by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and there will be no flow of blood, for if they are not incised, the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords at length, and do not let it putrefy before the consolidation of the wound and the occurrence of blood flow.
And then incise the excess which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-shaped cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of that same work.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a hot complexion; because cautery is one of those things that helps to dry out excessive humors, and therefore it is better in this case.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you clean the wound with old linen, and that decently made powders are placed on it, and then it should be treated with drying medicines that cause the flesh to grow and with bandages until it is healed.
And if, while you operate another time, there is a flow of blood from the artery, then you must take care to restrain that blood, either with cautery, or by filling the place with linen, and squeezing your hand until the bleeding is stopped. And if none of those things are at hand, then place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and apply water of intense coldness to the area until the sharpness subsides and it is constricted as needed.
And what is lighter in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each, very hot, until they reach the bone and incise the vein in two places, so that that which is between the extremities is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. But however, if it has less sharpness than two knives it is better, because if it is sharp like two knives close to each other, it will not incise the flesh with speed.
Therefore, since in those there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is held in them and the flesh is incised lightly.
And this method is better in every way and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two blades be the quantity of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter four.
On the treatment of sharp and acrid eye discharges.
When there are acrid tears, and the source is those veins which are on the scalp, and you find no cause for treatment in medicine, and sometimes the patient's face reddens and feels a crawling sensation on the forehead as if it were ants crawling, and their eyes are swollen, moist, so that the hairs around them are stuck together, and the eyelids are inflamed by the acridity of the tears, the ancients used to employ in the treatment of these, this operation, and they called this treatment "spassa".
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on his forehead, and then incise three fissures in the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure reaches two fingers: one fissure should be equally distant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length, a little above the movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers adjusted (or, ...the quantity of three finger-widths).
And have ready a piece of sponge or dried cloths with which to dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that (the spatula) all the skin which is between the two incisions with the scalpel which is on the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. Then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that (curette) against the flesh attached to the skin, and its blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that appearance of the skin, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, press the places of the congealed blood clots.
Then place in each fissure a pledget of old linen, and place upon them powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day untie the bandage and administer a large infusion of warm or tepid water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of tears from cataracts and those descending into the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone suffers from sharp and persistent cataracts, and the patient's eyes are noticeably weakened and small, and their vision is impaired, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their hairs fall out, and there is acute, throbbing pain in the forehead and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the matter and cataracts come from the many veins originating in the inner parts.
And the best cure in such cases is this: that you instruct the patient to shave their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be between the bones; and extend your hand from the temples' lacerations which are softened by chewing), until the bone is uncovered.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it above with powders soaked in wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then it is necessary to scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow there, and then treat it with a drying regimen which causes the flesh to grow, such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and make a plaster from them and apply it to these wounds to promote the growth of flesh.
Chapter 6.
On the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Every cause that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass, or it is from a plant such as a thistle or bean, or it is a flowing substance such as water and sour wine and things like them, or some animal.
And therefore, when a stone falls into the ear or another similar cause from among those things which do not adhere to or grow in the ear, and expose the ear to the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill into it some violet oil or sesame oil, and then proceed with its extraction, and induce sneezing with a potion, and block the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and pull the ear upwards, for many times it is expelled with these measures.
And if it is not expelled, then proceed with its extraction using the instrument called a fine ear pick, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the pick, it is good; and if not, then proceed with its extraction with a thin probe of little doubling (or slight curvature).
And therefore, if it is not expelled by this, then make a copper cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the opening of the ear and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the cannula. And then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times it happens as we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small quantity of lit tow or bird-lime prepared for catching birds, and place it on the end of a ray (possibly referring to a thin rod or sliver of wood), and then carefully wrap it around that cotton. And then gently insert that into the opening of the ear, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by all the means we have recounted, then you should consider cutting it before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of cutting it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to their strength, and then hold the ear between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear below its cartilage in the well-prepared area. And let the incision be crescent-shaped until the stone is reached; and, the stone found, remove it if possible with appropriate instruments; and then close the incision immediately, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause lodged in the ear is a growth that is growing and swollen, then administer its treatment and extraction; but if it does not obey such treatment, then take finely ground alum according to this method: and administer with that the removal of the growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on small pieces of cloth, and then extract them with tweezers or with a fine instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thus facilitated.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing as a first measure, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie down on the ear into which the water has entered; and if it is expelled by this, it is good; and if not, then take several heated stones or pebbles, about the length of a finger, and heat them slightly in the fire, and the patient inserts one of these into the opening of his ear and jumps on one foot on that side and strikes with another stone upon the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or tow, and place one end in the ear and hold the other end to the fire until the majority of it is burnt.
And then put in more tow and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a cannula as described above for the stone extraction.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a fly or something similar, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is a large creature, which appears to the sensible judgment, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks, and the cause of it is lighter than all the other causes that befall the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you cure it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your cure does not succeed, then you should expose the ear to the sun.
And so if some cause of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks, but if no cause appears, then take a cannula narrow below and wide above, of which this is the form: And introduce the thin end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it strongly, and do this many times until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you fill and close the circumference of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the cure of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and wide above.
And so be it that they push what is in the cavity of the container cannula where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a ray (possibly referring to a type of plant stem or reed) and wrap its extremity decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula—and that is in the ear—and then introduce the ray with cotton on top and press with your hand that with a moderate compression until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the hearing and the patient feels the oil inside.
And that which is poured into the ear should already be warmed a little with fire. And be careful that the substance which you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children are born from their mothers' wombs without perforated ears, and this also happens in some adults, an obstruction in the ear canal by a wound or by excess flesh in it; and this obstruction sometimes occurs in the preauricular area, which does not allow drainage, and sometimes in the outer parts.
And that which occurs in the preauricular area, which does not allow drainage, is in the most difficult conditions for healing.
And in that which allows drainage, you should place the patient's ear in the sun and observe it. Then, if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its extremity is small in width, one side being sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two finger-widths wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or its meatus, then take that with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the earlobe, then take a fine, thin probe and warm it slightly with fire, and then place it in the ear canal.
Then, if you have felt an obstruction with which the patient experiences difficulty, due to the severity of hearing,  remove the obstruction gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a piece of linen according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some lint and soak it in rosewater and sprinkle on it finely ground  [likely a healing powder - the specific ingredient is unclear], and use it; and if you see the ear is already abscessed, then you must remove the lint and replace it with other lint which you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the abscess is fully reduced; and then cure it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and place it on the ear, and use the other treatment which constricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
On the treatment of a stye which occurs on the eyelids.
Styes which occur on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with fingers, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and then apply a poultice to the affected areas.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a fine, lenticular cautery.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains from their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Often there develops in the eyelids of the eyes a certain condition which resembles swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of this swelling it is called [a swelling/tumor].
And it is an aggregation of thick humidity in the eyelid below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling proceeds from that which appears on the eyelid and is spread to every part; and its cause is light.
Then make an incision on that with a lancet in width, and then peel it away from every part with ease until it comes off, and then lift it up with tweezers and cut it off.
And if the wound is large, then you close it with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is small, it will not harm you because its ointment restores it and causes it to heal.
And if the growth extends to the inner parts of the eyelid beyond the inner surface, then lift the eyelid and lift the growth with tweezers,  even though you need to make an incision, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by incision, this harms nothing.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with something that heals until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a boil on the eyelid above the eye.
A stye is a swelling which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and especially in children; it inflames their eyes and makes them sensitive to light; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because tears flow from them.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and their lower eyelids, below the eyebrows, are moist, already covered with inflammation, and the imminence of a stye is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel a stye within.
And a method of operation is this: the patient rests his head on your lap, and you place a cloth on him and make him a poultice, and make for him a circle according to the size which contains the stye entirely, and then place this on the stye and press with your fingers on all sides so that the stye is pressed into the middle of the circle, and then make in the middle of the moistness with a lancet an incision with a fissure, and the fissure should not be larger than the fissure that is made in phlebotomy.
But in the beginning it is necessary that you cut the skin completely until you reach the stye, for in most cases the stye proceeds by fissure according to the form of a white swelling.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers on the outside parts and roll it between your right and left hand until it is gone.
And be careful not to push into the fissure, lest with the lancet you reach the eye and injure it.
But if the stye does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then push gently into the incision a little until the stye appears; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar and place them over the area and bind them with powders.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the fissure so that it dries up the remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with emollient plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the ways of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural hairs and are inflamed, then these harm the eye and cause various diseases, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membranes, until this becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye, which is called tactus (a touching or inflammation) of the eye, and it is cured in four ways:  either by cautery with fire; or with a sharp medicine, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery; or the tactus is treated by incision and suture; or by cannulas, as I shall explain.
And therefore it is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap; then evert the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is everted, good; and if not, introduce a needle into that part where there is pus under the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate upward, and this should be — near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow — near the hairs, and draw the pus to the upper parts with the eyelid, and evert it with a ray (of light, perhaps referring to using light to see better).
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid, beneath the inflamed hairs, with a pointed instrument, from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller; and then extract the pus and place small pieces of cotton or linen under the eyelid, and then bind it over the eyelid with a bandage, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape should be according to the amount of elevation of the eyelid, for this varies in people, for there are those who require a great deal of incision of the eyelid according to the extent to which the eyelid is softened.
And then make an incision with the pointed instrument along the two lines which you have marked, beginning from the larger lacrimal duct to the smaller. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, let it be the thickness of a king's hair (i.e., a very fine incision).
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it completely, and then join the two lips with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and stick any excess glue onto two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, do not worry.
And then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then treat it (the wound).
And if you wish, leave the wound without a suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its closing; but suturing is better. And therefore the ancients advised this.
However, let there be diligence in the patient's care, and it is a good operation, and let there be no fear in it.
And there is another method of treatment, which is to mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three hooks separated and joined according to this form:
But if this is not possible, to hold the hooks, and this is not equal, then take a needle on which there is thread and place that in the middle of the figure, and insert the other thread near the larger lacrimal duct, and the second thread near the smaller lacrimal duct, and adjust the threads between your fingers with equality, and then with those, with equal elevation, raise the whole eyelid on which is marked as we have recounted.
And then close the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted; then it is necessary that you use on that what we have said of incision; but suture in each case is more skillful.
Bandaging with canes is according to this method: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and incise the growth that is within as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two thin canes or splints whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the space. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads.
Then carefully add each one over what is superfluous of the eyelid's skin, and bind the canes to each part with a firm binding, and leave it for some days, for the growth, because of the binding, will die and dry out and will rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed, then break it with forceps, and then cure the wound until it is healed.
Then, when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the skin does not prick.
And this is the form of two canes which you will make according to this form: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12. Of the elevation of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is stiff.
When unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs are in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle and place on it a fine silk or linen thread, and then adjust its ends so that you tie each one in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be about the length of a palm.
And then you prepare another short, fine thread underneath, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
Then insert the needle into the root of the offending hair, which requires skill, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it from above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair upwards and insert it into the alixati (likely a type of tweezers or forceps), and let there be one, two, or three hairs, but no more.
Then pull your hand with it until the hair is pulled out with the alixolati (tweezers/forceps) from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
But if the alixalati (tweezers/forceps) is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will pull the alixalati downwards with the thread which you have composed with it, until the alixalati is removed from the wound above.
And examine it with the vision of your eye, for then you will remove the alixalati and the thread, and clean each and close the wound, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is elevated with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened to a certain space, and then you elevate it.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the treatment of an ehacratir (likely a type of stye or eyelid inflammation) which appears on the upper eyelid.
When an ehacratir appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is drawn upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called lagophthalmos (leporina likely means hare-lip like, referring to the appearance), and this ehacratir is either natural or accidental, and is caused by the consolidation of a wound or incision or cautery, or by something similar which has been poorly treated.
The method of operation is that you incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not fitting that you use treatments that dry or constrict; for if you do this, the ehacratir will return worse than it was before.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice with the water in which mallow and linseed have been boiled, or diachylon ointment which has been liquefied with some oil, and soak the linen cloth in it, and treat it with this.
And the key to your treatment is that you prevent it from consolidating improperly, in a way different from its initial form.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing but a correction of the ehalixacrati (likely a misspelling or archaic term for a medical condition) that does not return the area to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
Of the treatment of ehacrati (likely a misspelling or archaic term for a medical condition) which occurs in the lower eyelid.
This *alxacrati* (likely a variant spelling of the previous term), which occurs in the lower eyelid—which is truly called *alxacrati*—is sometimes natural, sometimes accidental.
But accidental *alxacrati* is caused by a wound, or by a cut, or by cautery, or by other similar things.
And the method of its operation is that you take a needle with double thread, and you insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh (the affected area of the eyelid).
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula. And then if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, it is good; but if not, take a splint and place it in the divided area, and with it restore the eyelid, and close the two fissures in the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures be at two angles of the incision which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be made of them so that when they come together, their shape is formed.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda (Λ).
Then remove the flesh to the extent that the sharp lower eyelid is, so that it becomes the eyelid.
Then join the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it is excised by fissure, suture, or cautery, then you must make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid as previously described. Then separate [the wound] with a poultice between two lips as we have said.
In summary, concerning the treatment of an abscess whether above or below, let the operation proceed as prepared in the manner of an abscess, and this is in the form of many varieties.
And the skillful surgeon always prepares instruments in every way possible so that he may restore the form to its natural state, or nearly so, and the patient, according to what suits him in the operation and the instruments, in the best possible condition.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men such that the upper eyelid is solidified with the white of the eye, and is prevented from its free movement and natural functions, then it is necessary that you insert the tip of a probe under the eyelid and elevate it, or spread it with an unguent.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed, but rather blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision carefully separate that adhesion easily until the eyelid is returned to its natural form and the whole adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distill into it some  henbane dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small linen cloth, and place on the eye wool infused in egg white, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two kinds, for it is either nervous, and is similar to hard, fine parchment; or it is non-nervous, similar to congealed white humidity, which when an iron touches it, or it is forced to be removed with an instrument, is severed and the instrument is not inserted into it.
And both types begin only from the larger tear duct until it gradually covers the sight and prevents light and the movement of the eye.
But the method of operating in its incision is that the patient places his head on your lap, and then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with an instrument of little thickness and extend it to the parts above. And then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or similar, or strong thread, or double the tip of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the parts above, and scrape with the hair the edge of the nail which covers the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair into the back of it.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a thin spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that by the incision of it there is no continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with only the instrument extended or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is its form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then the incision, put in the eye a little crushed salt or a poultice made of flax, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with what is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is the instrument inserted into it, then many times this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the patient's eye and take a thin lion spatula of iron sharpened according to this form: with subtlety.  (or, with precision/delicacy) And if you see that it is rarefied and is hidden and trapped in that root, then distill from your hour into the eye a poultice made of flax or with rue or with crushed salt, and occlude the eye until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all that is there is removed, unless the contrary happens and a hot abscess forms in the eye, for then you leave that, and treat the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
The prominence of the lachrymal flesh, if it is noticed in the eye as a great harm, should be suspended with an oncia (a unit of weight, implying a small weight or possibly a surgical instrument); and incise it in part, and do not extend the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
And then instill into the lachrymal duct a poultice of rue and flaxseed until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a staphyloma and that which is born of fleshy matter in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is born and grows until it covers the pupil, or approaches or presses upon the eyelids, and strongly compresses the eyelids on the outer parts, and resembles the rose of a balustrade (or, a rose-like growth).
But the operation is that the patient places his head on your lap; and then open the patient's eyes and collect all that flesh with instruments suitable for this, and hold it with forceps or with scissors; and then incise the flesh from the beginning until all is finished with the lancet, and be careful of the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision, with which you incise those [fleshy growths], be with a spatula, which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which the scab is collected, according to the form which will come to it in this chapter.
Then, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it a red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a bandage over the eye with egg white until it is assured of a hot abscess.
And if any cause of a fleshy growth remains and hot blood is drawn, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and cure that abscess with whatever will reduce that abscess, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly do so for the fleshy growth that occurs in the eye of this kind.
However, you must avoid any treatment of the fragile eye by natural or accidental means, working with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member is able to tolerate that operation.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is caused by inflamed veins which are swollen on the eye and prevent the vision from its function, and they weaken the eye over a long period of days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and there is no other illness in it besides the pus; then you may collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an ounce or two, according to your judgment; and let that ounce be of subtle duplication according to this form:
or two ounces gradually in one piece according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins be removed from the eye and be retracted.
And beware that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is at midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation that you do not cut except those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distil into the eye verdigris or alum so that with its sharpness it corrodes what is removed from the eyelid.
But if that is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that soothes his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is calmed and he is safe from a hot abscess.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Concerning the reduction of nasal dislocations.
When you treat a dislocation with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as described previously, and it is not healed, then do not make incisions in it but rather, incise the abscess above its maturity, and extract all the moisture that is within it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
And so when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a sharp head, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round, like a chisel, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle pointing (as is in the following form).
And place that [instrument] on the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and styptic substances.
Then if the area is consolidated and good flesh has grown there, and the body of the pus is excised and remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and is not abscessed and no accident occurs there, then you will know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no other method than to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this manner:  that is, you uncover the second bone with iron or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a file according to this form:
Let the tip of the iron be triangular, and its shaft be thin and tapered to the tip, like this [presumably a diagram was present in the original].
And then place that [the triangular iron instrument] on the bone, and let it be near the lacrimal [tear duct]; and move your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the file until it penetrates the whole bone, and the patient will feel this because they will feel the air escaping when you move your hand.
Then restore the area with styptic, drying medicines as you have been taught.
Then, when the flesh is born again and the area is hardened, the matter which flowed to the outer parts returns to the nose, therefore this is easier on the patient.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety and there is no accompanying injury, diminution, or impairment of vision, then you should leave the patient alone, and closely observe them.  Apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suction, for good evacuation.  Then apply to the eye an ointment made from  acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and firmly secure the plaster over the eye with many powders.
And the method for the powders is that you take many linen cloths, and each cloth should be folded in four layers; and make many of these.
Then place these one upon the other, according to the amount that the eye requires. Then bind these firmly with a strong, hard cloth; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye tightly bound day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it should be bound very tightly.
Then remove the bandage day and night, as we have said.
And if you see the eye is already reduced, it is good; but if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders, and the binding, and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Of the incision of the eminence of the uvea tunic.  (Note:  "uvea tunic" refers to the iris and ciliary body.)
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the person's appearance is marred by it, and you wish to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted: you introduce the needle into the root of the uvea from below upwards, and then place another needle with double thread from the lachrymal side, and make it penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then incise the area of the double thread and lift with it the part of the uvea in the circumference of the needle, and tighten that firmly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and allow the thread to remain with the uvea.
And then treat the eye with what strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes gather from all sides with a circle of cloth within the eye a large prominent area, and then it should be perforated with a thin spatula that reaches the pupil of the eye, and run the albuginea (white of the eye) humour, and lower the eye and it will enter immediately.
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of alconati (likely a disease or condition, the exact meaning requires further context).
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a humour which is located in the eye, similar to descending water, but it is not that.
But the method of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight chair, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and gently manipulate it until you see the humour descend to the lower parts, and then it should be dried so it does not descend further, and light should be avoided, and the patient should see things as he usually sees.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water (referring to the humour).
But if the descent of the humor is not achieved by what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a thin spatula and use it on the panniculus, carefully scraping a little below the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus (near the empty space), until the humor is expelled.
Then, once it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
Concerning the treatment of the water descending from the eye.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division and which ones it is appropriate to puncture, explaining this according to their nature/health condition.
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands on a stool, and tie his healthy eye, binding it tightly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his eye, if the eye in which the water is located is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is left; or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
And then place the tip of the almond near the cornea, at the edge of the iris in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller lachrymal gland, and gently press the almond with a rotating motion.
And then penetrate the white of the eye and feel that the almond has reached the empty space (or cavity).
And it is necessary that the distance from the almond to the pupil be the same as the space between the pupil and the edge of the blackness (iris), which is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with this pupil the vision of the eye through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the almond into the place where the water (aqueous humor) is, and then draw it down one time after another, and if the water descends immediately, then the patient will see that upon which his sight rests immediately, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then, if the water has descended, you should then pause again before the almond is ejected.
And then, when it is dried and does not descend, you extract the almond easily, and gently rotate it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and wash the eye inside with it; and then place on the outside of the eye cotton or tow or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with this.
But we and those of our time place on that [wound] crushed comfrey with egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness — for there are some men whose eyes are very hard — then it is necessary that you take the spatula which is named alberid, of which this is the form:
Then perforate that joint with it, and do not insert your hand into the hole, but only make a subtle passage for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, let a sleeping place be prepared for the patient, decently made, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and let all movements be prohibited.
And position him in such a way that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the bandage be according to its disposition until the third day.
And then unbind it in that dark room and expose the affected area to view, and show him some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of the treatments or immediately after the infusion. Furthermore, it is necessary that you avoid this because the water might easily escape due to great and vehement movement.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then it is necessary that you unbind the wound before the seventh day, and rectify it with what is suitable for an abscess.
Then you uncover the affected area and place a mask over his face, by which his sight is regulated, keeping him for some days in the dark room.
And then let him be removed from that dark place gradually and conversed with regarding his affairs.
And know that in this situation the student is not excused from some observations, and then you should be bold in the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Al-Andalus, and some say that fire is made in a perforated earthen vessel, by which the water is sucked up.
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read this in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is novel.
And these are the forms of the types of earthenware so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And let them be made of bronze or iron properly, and let their extremities be of this triangulated subtlety, the sharp extremity thus, as that is the form.
Chapter 24.
Of the cure of rotten flesh in the nose.
When in the nose there are born diverse fleshy growths, of which some cause is assembled like a very small scorpion, or a polyp fish; and this illness is called polyp, for it is similar to that fish in representation. And from it is cancerous flesh, foul, of dark color; and from it is flesh that is not of dark color, a lion. (The last phrase is unclear. "Carn leon" may be a descriptive term, possibly referring to a specific type of growth, or it could be a scribal error).
Therefore, in that which is in these fleshy growths, neither fraudulent nor cancerous, it is fitting that you make the patient sit between your hands and place him in the sun, and open his nostrils, and prick your ounce (likely a unit of weight, perhaps referring to an amount of a specific medicinal substance) into those fleshy growths. And then extract that to the outside parts, and then incise that which you have grasped of those with a sharp, subtle spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; that if some cause remains from it of which the excision is possible, then you scrape that with one of the subtle instruments easily until nothing remains of it. But if it swells with blood or a hot abscess forms, then you apply to it what is fitting; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you cut and cauterize that until the bleeding is stopped and all the cavities are removed.
And then let there be poured into the nose near the incision, strong wine and water, or wine. But if the nose is opened and humidity proceeds from it into the palate, then know that it is already healed.
But if the humidity does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is flesh embedded in the pus above the bones of the nostrils to which excision has not reached.
Then it is necessary that you introduce a linen thread into it, to which some thickness is attached, and tie on it many knots, and place between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and instruct the patient and introduce one end of the thread into the nostril with a probe or with any other instrument that is possible for you.
And after you have done this, let him draw its scent until it reaches the canals of the nostrils, and it comes out over his throat, for many times children do something similar at school, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it.
And then place the two ends of the thread, one end that comes out over the nose and the other that remains in the nose, and then administer a piece of meat with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is already with the knots of the thread.
And then extract the thread, and place near the nose, near the extraction of the blood, a poultice, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
And finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a more intense cure, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purger, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or bronze, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small conch shell, and the channel similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purger instrument should be flat and open; it should have a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water, or whatever you want of the juices and extractable substances in it.
Chapter 25.
Of boils that grow in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a boil grows in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in a few days, before much attention is paid to it.
And for that reason, you should incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate it entirely. Then place on the spot either a cautery or a burning medicine which stays in place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened, firm, dark in color, and insensitive; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; for many times he who incises this abscess suffers great harm from it which he previously did not have.
And if the abscess is slightly swollen and not dark in color, and it seems that incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the place with that which dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when a solution of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should have little confidence in that operation except in certain cases.
Therefore, when it happens to someone that they suffer from any of those causes, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood, and then you join the two edges of the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the edges of the solution of continuity are already separated, and each is healed, then it is necessary that you scrape each part of its apparent skin until blood comes out. Then join the two edges with sutures and tighten them, and on them sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed linseed, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it bound for two or three days, and then unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the stitches are shed, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of the suture is that you close the solution of continuity either with needles, as we have recounted in the suture of the abdomen, or close the solution of continuity with thread as has been taught to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things which come between the two edges in the inner parts.
Many times there appear in the inner parts of the lips of men certain hard abscesses resembling the fat of a hedgehog, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Then it is necessary that you separate the lips and  incise each of those hardnesses completely, and then fill the place of the excision with crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and then wash it with sharp wine and treat the place with something styptic until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the incision of the flesh grown in the gums.
Often a growth appears on the gum, which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you lift that with tongs or hold it with forceps and incise it down to its root, and let the serum or blood flow.
And then place crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders on the area.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for after cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, sticky scabs are found, and sometimes they are blackened and become yellow or green, so that the gum is affected by this corruption, and the teeth become loose.
And therefore it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands and rest their head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those scabs appear and similar substances like sand, until nothing of them remains, and do this for the blackness and yellowness and the others until they are cleaned.
Then if that which is at the beginning of the treatment is removed, it is good; and if not, then you repeat the treatment on them the next day and the second and the third until you arrive at the desired end.
And know that teeth require many scrapers of diverse forms and shapes, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped on the inside is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms, and these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you cure the tooth of its pain with all skill and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that compensates for its loss when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, which is an excuse for its extraction.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is diseased, because many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the work of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is diseased, and you know it well, then you must scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, beginning little by little until it is completely loose.
Then apply strong, large forceps for good traction or firm grip, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold it well and it does not move, and then pull the tooth straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not removed, take one of those instruments and place it under the tooth on all sides easily and forcefully remove it in the same way as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you should fill that crack with a cloth and tighten it with a thin, fine thread so that it is not broken at the time of your traction on it with forceps.
And you must carefully open with scarification around the entire gum and watch your strength so as not to break it and leave a part of it behind, which would return to afflict the patient with a worse condition than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and audacity in extraction, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great illnesses in men which are more difficult to cure, and the roots of their teeth remain, some or all of them, or that they extract the tooth along with some bone from the jaw, as we have often testified.
And after the extraction, the mouth should be washed with warm wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding occurs from this, as often happens, then crush some amount of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if this alum does not work, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is initially grasped should be long in the gripping part, short in the handle, and thick, so that they do not bend when working with them.
And let them be like tongs with a thick handle so that when you squeeze with them they do not bend; the gripping ends should be short.
And let them be made of Indian iron, precisely made with straight ends, and at the ends of these let there be teeth, of which some interlock with others and tighten by strong compression; and sometimes the ends of these should be in the shape of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and they are of strong compression.
Chapter 31.
On the extraction of teeth and the removal of broken jawbones.
When you must extract a tooth that is broken and some part remains, then you should apply a poultice to the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then introduce pliers or forceps, the ends of which are shaped like the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Let their ends be made inwardly like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you easily with these forceps or pliers, then you should dig around the root and remove all the flesh and introduce an instrument called an *atali*, that is, a small lever whose shape is this:
And let it have a short, somewhat thick end, and let it not be bent so that it does not break.
Then if by this the root is extracted, good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments, of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is a triangular end which has some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it be triangular and of a more subtle end.
And you are helped with this instrument having two prongs, of which this is the form approximately the following: and with other instruments which precede in the extraction of teeth; for help is done with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, and this is the form:
of the triangular, curved or short end, which has some thickness, and is not bent so that it is not broken.
And you should know that the instruments for loose teeth are similarly made to the other instruments.
But the skilled and subtle artisan, finds for himself according to what the operation and the various illnesses signify to him; for there are illnesses to which the ancients did not give or devise a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse species.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken or injured, then it should be treated in its place with that which is convenient for it from among the instruments and forceps which we have described in the extraction of tooth roots, and help yourself with a splint of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely set; and then restore the area with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth protrude beyond their natural alignment, their shape is flawed, especially in women, and especially in venerable old women; therefore you must consider: if a tooth is adjacent to another tooth and closure or alignment is not possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you should incise it with an instrument of which this is the form; and it is similar to a pig's tusk, and should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp point.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be done in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that no other teeth are damaged.
And if the protruding tooth is amenable to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file, of which this is the form:
And let the entire thing be of Indian iron and very carefully shaped; and let it have very fine points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth should be filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and is filled so that the tongue is not injured and speech is not impaired.
Chapter 33.
On the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated it with styptic medicines, and your treatment has not been effective, then to prevent them from falling out, devise a way to strengthen them with gold wire, and not silver, because silver turns green and is easily powdered after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; and the method of application is that you take the wire and pass double the length needed between two healthy teeth, and then so that it grows with two twists of the wire between the damaged teeth, whether one or more, until the wire reaches a healthy tooth on the other side. And then repeat the weaving to the point where you began, and tighten it carefully and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you tighten the wire, be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.
And then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends in each place, and cover them and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that it does not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened like a Roman [brace/bandage/binding].
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the straightening of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, thus as you see these bound:
And when it is done that one or two teeth return to the proper alignment of each in their places, and are regrown as we have recounted, and that they remain fixed.
And this is only done by good craftsmen and wise [men/people].
And sometimes some material from cow bones is prepared, and it is made from them in the form of a tooth, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is fastened as we have said, and it remains and serves in that way for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which is found under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation on him is that you open the mouth of the patient, his head being in your lap; and elevate his tongue, and then incise that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its restriction.
But if in that [area] there is some hardness or knot, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you should incise and divide that across its width until you have cut the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the front of the flesh and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
Then let the site of the incision be washed with warm water or with wine vinegar or with cold water; and then place under the tongue linen cloths; that is, a piece of cloth which the patient should keep under his tongue every night so that it does not heal again [in the wrong way].
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat that [wound] with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
Concerning the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess similar to a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting in front of the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined towards white, and there is moisture in it, then you place your thumb there, and incise it with a thin spatula, and incise it on all sides; and if blood flows during your operation, then place crushed verdigris (or vitriol) on it until the blood is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed with sour wine and salt; and treat it with the other remedies for this until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. On the extraction of an abscess from the two ears and from that which is located in the throat and other abscesses.
When a goiter develops in the throat, these are glands that are gathered together like cotton, which protrude outwards and are called “two ears”, and when you treat them with what we have said in the previous section and it is not healed, then you consider whether the abscess is hard, dark colored, and insensitive; then do not touch it with an iron instrument.
And if it is red and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then you will either extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is one that should be incised.
And the operation on it is that you consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already been reduced by complete rest or if it has diminished in any way; and then make the patient sit before the sun, and their head should be on your lap, and open their mouth, and the servant, taking hold with their hands, should press down the patient's tongue with a very fine instrument, of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or brass, and let it be thin like a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with it and the abscess is shown to you, and you look at it carefully, then take an oncia and place it in the tonsil, and pull it outwards as much as you can. Also, if you pull out some matter from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Also, if you pull out some matter from the membranes, then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it resembles forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner, and immediately after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with a decoction of pomegranate bark or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and immediately treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two tonsils, and incise those as I have said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat, which abscess was dark in color, with little sensation, which had already closed her throat, and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and drink of water, and she was close to death if she had lasted another day or two.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had created two passages through which it exited through two openings.
Then I treated it fistularly and inserted an instrument into one of the openings, and I pulled it, and a large portion was drawn out, and immediately I incised it from where I understood the other opening was, and immediately I opened its mouth, and compressed its tongue, and immediately I inserted the instrument into that abscess.
And immediately I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Then the woman's throat was completely free, and she immediately began to drink water, and soon after she ate food, then I did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess succeeded it in that place, which I incised until it was completely resolved.
Then I took hold of it and cauterized her throat; then I stopped the addition [of medication or treatment]; and immediately I went for a walk and I didn't know what God would do about it then.
Chapter 37.
Concerning the incision of a wen when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and elongated, then it is called a perpendicular [abscess]; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your treatment is not effective, and you see that the cauterized abscess is still there and is subtle, then you should incise that which is round and aggregated; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and it is not sensitive to the touch, then you should postpone its incision, for in that case there is danger for the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner that I have described, in its whiteness and length, you should make the patient sit and press their tongue with an instrument that follows its shape, and then place the hook on the uvula and pull it down and incise it with one of two instruments that are described in the incision of the two almonds [tonsils].
And you must not incise it except what is exactly at the natural limit without addition, because if you incise more, you will injure their speech.
And for the incision, use what we have recounted in the incision of the two almonds [tonsils], and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by its incision, you should use ingenuity in its cauterization without fear, and the manner of cauterization is only with a sharp water [likely referring to a caustic solution], and it is that you place the patient's head in your lap, and then press their tongue with the instrument which we have mentioned, and then take of the water which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with that live coal [or heated instrument], and do not apply it thickly or thinly, and with that fill the concavity of the instrument of which this is the form:
Let the extremity of it be a concavity in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on their side so that the saliva or mucus from their mouth flows out because of the internal medicine, so that nothing of it descends onto their throat and harms them.
Then take your hand with the medicine, and press it onto the uvula for half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and introduce the spoon with the cotton into a tube above so that the cotton adheres to that tube, and do this as many times as is necessary to achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it, for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it, and after the cauterization wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and clean with that what remains around it from the medicine, and wash it with cold water, and treat externally with embrocation [a topical application], and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this method of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured by a method gentler than cautery or incision, for it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, origanum, rue, dried Arabic gum, chamomile, and similar herbs, and combine all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and submerge them in sharp wine and boil; and the pot should be well sealed with suitable clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be a hole over which a concave brass instrument is placed,  in this manner; it may be made of silver or brass.
And insert the end into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the small tube, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this several times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the development of an abscess, for it would aggravate the abscess too much, and you should not do this, but rather cauterize the declared abscess.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a cane and attach a hen's egg shell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is protected, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Of the extraction of thorns and that which adheres to the throat and of other causes.
Many times, a fish bone or some other thing adheres to the throat.
Then it is necessary that you extract what is visible of those things, upon which your sight falls, after you press the tongue with an instrument in front of the sun, so that it may be shown to you what is in the throat.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, tie it firmly with thread, and let the patient swallow it, for when it arrives at the place where the thorns are, it will extract them, and then they will be expelled. And moreover, take an eel, bind it with thread, and let it be inserted and quickly extracted; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly pull it out.
But if they are not expelled by those means which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be somewhat thicker than a finger, and at its extremity let there be a concavity which you may easily insert into his throat.
And let him have his head raised up, and be careful that you touch his throat bone, so that it may happen to him that with that you push the bone or thorn, or that the physician do so with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself insert it, because of his knowledge of the location of the lodged cause, and push downwards, and pull his hand up with the instrument, all this according to the amount that is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not help, then consider placing it in the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed their tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Therefore, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with gentle, careful movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this repeatedly (until the leech is dead and leaves the throat) and abstain from giving the patient any water that day.
Then take a vial full of cold water, and open their mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow anything from it and agitate the water every now and then with your hand, for the leech, as soon as it feels the water, falls off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cymene or asafoetida through the instrument which we have recommended for the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of this is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which there is a hole, and the end of the instrument is fitted into that hole; and then begin the fumigation; and have the patient put their mouth to the end of the cannula, and close their mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall off.
And if it does not fall off, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus necessarily it should be expelled with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps as you sometimes see, except that it has some curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughening of a file, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of the discourse on the opening of abscesses and on their incision.
Abscesses are of many kinds, in many ways, according to the remembrance of them, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is by the species of abscesses in themselves; and by that which we understand of the humors.
And the second way is according to the places in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each of them has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, some abscesses are such that they should not be perforated except near the maturation of the pus in them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be opened when they are raw and not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, because when an abscess is near a joint, its being is prolonged until it may consume that which is around it, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore a cause of contraction of that limb is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured it will harm the principal member; or it is near the anus, therefore perforate it unripe; and it is not fitting to perforate it raw, of uncompleted digestion, except that which is near the anus, so that its matter may not spread and be elongated to the parts within the anus, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in such a way that it is not healed. Moreover, you must know the time of the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and the cessation of the fever, and also the diminution of the hardness and of the pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know the perforation should fall in the place lowest in the abscess and furthest from the healing eminence.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or feet, and away from the tendons, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and, finally, in all equal places in which there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you delay its perforation until its digestion is confirmed according to what has been said; for if you perforate it before that, the pus is prolonged and much filth is formed, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body because of necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation or many incisions according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And there are other abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be incised and curved, when it is made like bread and is already ripe, as happens in cases of carbuncles and buboes.
And some of these are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And some of them are treated with a round incision and a crescent-shaped incision, and similar to those.
But in those that are not like the superficial boils, you should perforate it with only a superficial or flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you should perforate it and do not attempt to extract all the pus at once; having extracted some of it, then dress the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and do this many times gradually until it is all removed.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in a decrepit state, because the vital spirit is often dissolved with the egress of the pus, and the patient dies very easily, and you will open them.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you must cleanse the wounds and consider then if the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then you should apply lint or old linen to it; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you should place a wick in each opening until they come together.
And if a part of the skin is cut away in the abscess, or you have hollowed it out around the edges, then you should fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have extracted splinters or roots, without moisture; and dress it on the third day; and then proceed and treat it with the ointments that are needed until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you dip a linen cloth, and apply this to the bleeding area many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer the treatment and care and powders which I have mentioned in many places in this our book and division.
But if it is in winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should infuse powders in hot wine and oil, and apply them to the area.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders soaked in water and oil or with wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and cleanse it and administer to its treatment what is appropriate until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally; but according to the way of distinction, I have already spoken of each abscess and in what manner is the way of its treatment, in separate chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which occur in the back of the head.
In the back of the head, small abscesses occur, and they are a kind of nodes which contain membranes that are attached to them; and their kinds are many.
And of them, some are purulent, and those contain a humidity similar to lime (or possibly referring to a viscous, lime-like consistency). And of them, some contain a humidity resembling dust, and similar to them; and of them, some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all of them, and in the extraction of them, there is no fear, since the extraction of them does not cause contrary [harm/injury/a reaction].
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is like this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if that which it contains is humidity, then incise it with a cut along its length, with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G. Then, when the humidity is evacuated, you should scrape that skin that contained the humidity, and do not leave any of it at all, for often it returns if any of it remains.
And then submerge cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in water and salt; and fill the wound with it and leave it there until the next day, for with this you corrode everything that remains of that membrane.
And then repeat on that cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if necessary, until you are confident that there is no remnant of that membrane; then cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you should incise it according to this form: with an incision having the form of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from all parts, and exert your strength in extracting the tunic which contains it.
But if your incision meets with resistance, then do what I recounted to you first.
And similarly proceed in a petrified abscess, in incision and cure, as we have told you; and the incision on a petrified abscess is easier, for it has little blood and little humidity.
And sometimes some of these abscesses, which are in the head in some men, contain no humidity at all; the reason is that I incised an abscess in the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, rough, white stone, which could not be broken, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head besides this one, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses that occur on the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of these should all be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those from the lowest part of them so that the body is relieved of the pus in the lowest parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for that cure.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42: On the incision of scrofulas which occur in the neck.
Often these abscesses happen in the neck, and in the armpits, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur in other parts of the body.
And those which occur in the neck, many are generated among themselves, and every scrofula of those is within its own tunic, and just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the species of these scrofulas are many, for among them are some stony, and some that contain humidity, and some are malignant which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that which you see to be of good disposition on touching, whose manifest color is close to the color of the flesh, and is softened throughout, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, you should incise it with a superficial incision from the upper to the lower part of the body along the line of G within the line of B, and scrape it from all sides, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is most important that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the instrument not be too sharp, lest you injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the patient, and lest you incise what is not necessary to incise; for if you should incise a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and compress the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound is softened and begins to be purulent. When the blood is severed/cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your index finger if there is any cause of other small scrofulae; then incise those and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is necessary then that you not incise that scrofula at its root. Beforehand, it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then care for it.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, then you must bring together the two lips of the wound and stitch it immediately so that no superfluity remains.
But if you see that superfluity remains because of the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you understand how to incise the root of it, and remove it and administer suture and what is said [above/before].
And for those scrofulas that contain humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and position the perforation so that it is at the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes what remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound is already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the head of the abscess accidentally occurring in the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the head [of the abscess], and no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the written account of those men's words.
But in men having a throat abscess, the extraction of the head [of the abscess] must be avoided, because no benefit is gained thereby, since all the veins and major arteries of the patient are located there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth, throat, or both ears, when the disease is not in the throat passage [esophagus/trachea], it is necessary to use the incision of the head [of the abscess] to avoid the harm that is caused by suppuration.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we must incise the head of the abscess below three circles of the circles of the abscess, or four with a small incision in the width between two circles in such a quantity that the incision is in the fatty tissue, not in the cartilage; and this location is suitable for incision, because it is free of flesh and its blood vessels are far away.
And if the physician is timid, then he should extend the skin of the throat with forceps, and then carefully incise the skin until he reaches the abscess, but avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of them.
And then incise the fatty tissue as we have recommended; and the incision of the throat is indicated by the inflammation that has come out of it with what is broken from it, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Therefore, when the time has arrived in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the skin of the wound, and sew it up alone, without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the discourse which we have recounted, is an exposition that shows that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some proceed to incise the epiglottis so that the patient may breathe through the area of the wound for some respiration, and be saved from death.
And for that reason, I command that the wound be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then I command that the wound be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And this I have seen with my own eyes: a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and cut with it a part of the windpipe; and I was called to her treatment, and I found the wound as it is found in those bitten, and I uncovered the wound and found blood which had flowed from the small wound.
Therefore, I was convinced that she had not cut a vein or artery, and air was issuing from the wound, and I treated it until it was healed.
And there happened to the servant nothing except hoarseness in her voice, and after some days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the section of the epilepsy there is no fear.
Chapter 44.
Chapter 44. Of an incision concerning an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess called throat hernia is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and it is very common in women.
And it is according to two manners, for it is either natural or accidental.
And in the natural [type], there is no way to cure it.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other manner resembles an abscess which is made by the knotting of an artery, and in that there is danger. And it is not fitting to act presumptuously with iron, except in that which is small. And you probe that and investigate that with the finger, and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you incise it as with nodes, and extract it with that which contains it from the skin and a blister; and if not, then its whole being is examined, and then cure the place with that which is necessary for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
Of the incision of the kinds of nodes.
There are many kinds of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division.
And it is necessary that I recount thus the difference between a node and a protrusion, lest there be doubt.
Therefore I say that with a protrusion there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling of the superfluity is sedated; and putrefaction is complete, whereupon the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that lymphatic humor which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made like a bladder, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two kinds, for they are either fatty and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division.
Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, that you expel it and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called a probe, according to how its form will appear in the chapter which is near this one.
And the manner of investigating abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the membrane.
And then place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the probe and consider what has come out in its wake.
And if the flowing humidity, whatever its color, is expelled, then you incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if no humidity comes from the track of the probe, then know that it is a fatty tumor (or lipoma).
And dry it out with an incision in the form of a cross, according to this form: as I have shown you, and suspend it with hooks, and peel off the skin from all sides easily, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract the pus with the node.
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this often happens, and then you extract it in pieces until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the node will return again.
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound, and place on it a hot poultice, and treat it with another cure until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you sew the two lips of it and treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh.
But if a pulsating vein is opposite it, or a non-pulsating one, then you consider and fill the place with crushed vitriol and leave it tightly bound for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood ceases; and then return to incising that which remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and there are three types: of these, some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, of good quality, with suitably rounded ends, so that they easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are called *albered*, and one of them is called *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form:
The form of the medium instrument, its form:
The form of the small instrument, its form:
It is agreed that they are suitable for those abscesses and discharges and fistulas and buboes, because among those are some from bones and other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and are made of brass, or of brass or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of brass.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are agreed to be used to open fistulas in the cavities of which are reflections, so that they are reflected with their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the width of the fistula and its stricture.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many types, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are curved hooks, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of them there are those having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place/context.
Shape of a small simple hook, its form:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are incised and scraped, and they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those [scalpels] with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way except that the scraping of the nodes may be done easily, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve, and through this the patient may be healed and find a little tranquility through the cauterization which he finds after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the forms of the lancets, and there are three types: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
Let them be made of bronze and similar to a ray, with which alcohol is made.  (The reference to "ray" and alcohol is unclear and may be a mistranslation or reference to a specific type of bronze alloy or a process.)
And it is at the pointed extremity, hidden with a spatula, and in that direction to the inner and outer parts, when you wish, as you see.
The shapes of spatulas, which are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses and the patient does not perceive them, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is drawn off, and there are three types: large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They are made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that you may draw off blood quickly when necessary, and when at first there is no other medicine.
However, do not use these to draw blood from every part of the body, but only in fleshy areas, such as the calves of the legs and thighs, and in the fleshy parts of the arms, and the breasts, and the abdomen, and the knees, and similar fleshy, moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to small bags, according to this form; through which blood is drawn off when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein or by arrow wound.
And sometimes they are made round, according to this form:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the care of men's breasts which resemble those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to the habit of sleeping, and then the breasts become inflamed, and they resemble the breasts of women, and remain apostematous, swollen.
And to one who has this, it is necessary that he incise those with a lunar section, according to this form, from line B to line G, and then scrape away all the thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then join the two lips of the wound with suture, and care for it until it is healed.
But if the breast droops downwards and is softened by its size, as happens in women, then let it be split in two, in its upper parts, with two incisions similar to a lunar figure, each contained within the other, the end of one within the other, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from line B and line G. And then scrape the skin which is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer what we have said concerning the suture and the powders, that which is necessary in the cure until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what must be incised because of the patient's unease and the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then care for it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the perforation of abscesses that form under the armpit.
These abscesses that form under the armpit are a kind of scrofula, hard, containing a sac-like skin.
And some of these contain humidity; and those that contain humidity must be incised with a lunate incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been evacuated, then you fill it with old linen and leave it there until the next day.
And then the linen should be removed and treated with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the kind of nodes and scrofulas, then you incise it as we have said in the section on scrofulas.
But if the wound is so extensive that it produces putrefaction, then administer cautery as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from archery or bloodletting.
When an artery is broken and the clot that forms on it is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs. And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are due to an artery or vein: for when an abscess is due to an artery, it is long and attached deeply in the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a kind of grating or creaking sound within it.
And that which is due to a vein is round and superficial on the body.
And incision of this abscess is dangerous, especially in that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and if it is very large, then its treatment with iron (surgery) should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should also be avoided [i.e. incision should be avoided].
But concerning that which is there because of inflammation of the opening of the artery, make a longitudinal incision in the clot; and then widen the incision with forceps, and then approach the artery, and free it from the surrounding tissues until it is uncovered.
And then place a needle on it and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with a double ligature in two places —  a procedure which I have already shown you in the extraction of two arteries that were in the temples.
And then, press the area between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is resolved.
And then administer treatment to the area where pus is generated until the ligatures fall off; and then treat it with ointments suitable for this purpose until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a severed vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand as much as possible of the abscess with the clot, and then insert the needle below the area which you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature, as I have shown you in the ligature of a grape, in two parts, with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will pull out, then insert the thread with that needle under the entire abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when what is in it has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the clot, and leave what is tied in it.
And then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1 of the abscess which happens because of a twisted nerve.
Just as abscesses happen in arteries and veins, similarly abscesses happen in the nerves when they are hit or injured by excessive work, and similarly.
And it is mostly found in the places of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are weakened.
And the abscess is serious, and it resembles the color of the other body parts, and it is in the greatest part of its disposition without them, and when it is squeezed with force, the patient feels a similar numbness.
And the abscess is not aggregated in the front of the body, and therefore it is below the ribs, and it is weakened in every part and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, for those [abscesses] that are in the joints, it is not suitable to be invaded with iron, because a contraction will quickly happen.
But that which is in the head or on the forehead, treat it with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then grasp it with forceps and excise it from the roots.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which occurs from that which happens to the abdomen.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies,  tumors which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and the lips of these are turned inward, and some are small, and some are very large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two tumors which were very similar to fungi, and there was no difference between them, white, with thin roots.
And the lips of these were turned inward and split open, and humidity constantly flowed from them.
Therefore I incised them and found in one about eighteen ounces, and in the other about six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the tumor is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be in your presence in the fire, because many times after its section much blood is expelled; and if the blood overwhelms you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind it to the tumor, in the manner which we have described; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease tightening the lead greatly over the tumor, until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
But if the tumor has a deep root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the abdomen.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then treat it until the wound is healed.
And be careful that you do not presume to incise a tumor which is dark-colored, insensitive, and of slow growth, for that is likely cancerous.
And I come to the remembrance of cancer concerning this.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia is caused by many things; either by fissures of the umbilicus which is on the abdomen, and from it the membrane or intestine protrudes as happens in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or by constricted flatulence within it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the umbilicus and protrusion of the membrane, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is as we have recounted, with even greater variability, and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and quickly returns; and it is very easily felt there, and is greatly increased by the entrance of a bath and strenuous work.
But if it is due to humidity, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the swelling is hard, large and firm, and is located in a specific place.
But if it is due to wind/gas, then touching it feels soft.
And the operation on it is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is from an artery, or from a vein, or from wind/gas; then you should be forbidden from treating it, because in that there is fear and danger, just as I taught you in the chapter in which I spoke of swellings from an artery and from a vein.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is from the intestine or from the membrane, then you should order the patient to hold his breath, and stand extended; and then mark with a probe around the entire umbilicus, and then order him to lean between your hands on his belly, and then surround with a broad spatula the circumference of the umbilicus over the area which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling upwards with a large finger; and then bind around with strong thread or with a bandage, and tie it in a suitable manner.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and seek the intestine; and if you have found it and held it by the ligature, then you carefully extract and push the intestine into the interior parts of the belly.
And if you have found the membrane, then take that with a finger; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is an artery or vein contrary to you, then surround that area, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put on them two strong threads and insert the two needles into the circumference which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh dries and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thinned and dried, and then treat it with whatever ointments are necessary until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the navel is of raw flesh or from humidity, then it is necessary that you concavate the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or humidity which you find there, and then treat it with what is necessary and which consolidates the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken, in the division, of the types of cancer and in what manner it is possible to treat it with medicines, and that it is better to avoid treating it with iron so that it is not ulcerated; and we have described cancer engendered in the womb and caution regarding its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, such as cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and similar members, to extract it all, and especially when it is small and beginning.
But when it is old and large, one should not meddle with it, for I myself could not heal anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone else who has succeeded.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and leave the patient and purge the black bile sometimes, and then bleed the patient if a manifest repletion is found.
And then prepare the patient with a preparation in which the location of the operation is included, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then scrape it completely with a good, sharp curette until no part of its roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not staunch it lightly, and press the areas, and wipe away the thick blood completely with your hand or with whatever instrument is available to you among your instruments.
But if you find excessive thick blood from a vein incision or an artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
Concerning the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy from water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or the species of anasarca, because that is mortal.
And when you have treated this species of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is ineffective, then consider: for if the patient has already acquired weakness, or has another illness along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain, and similar things, then be careful not to treat him with iron, for there is danger in that.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with him there is no other illness but dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old man, then the manner of his operation is that you raise the patient between your hands, and the attendant then presses his belly with his hand, driving the water towards the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a sharp-pointed instrument in this manner:
Let it be two-sided, sharp and long, with a pointed end like a spatula; however, let there be some slight shortness in it, so that in the operation with it you do not penetrate the intestine and injure it.
And then consider if the generation of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you, with the incision, distance yourself from the navel by the amount of three fingers towards the lower parts, directly over the pubis.
But if the generation of the dropsy is due to a liver ailment, then your incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its generation is due to the spleen, then your incision should be on the right.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wishes to lie, lest the superfluities flow to that fragile place.
Then perforate the entire peritoneum with the instrument, and then introduce it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the peritoneum and the omentum, and you shall scrape that; and if it is the quantity of a fingernail or thereabouts.
Then perforate the omentum until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the location of the water. Then extract that and introduce an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tinned lead, which at its lowest part has a small hole, and on its sides it has three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its incised extremity is shaped like a feather, thus:
And at its uppermost extremity is a ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately rests upon the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a moderate amount, for if you evacuate more than is necessary at once, the patient will quickly die from the dissolution of his animal spirit, or a syncope will occur, which is near to death.
But evacuate it according to the patient's strength and according to what the patient's condition, pulse strength, and overall well-being indicate to you.
Then remove the instrument, and retain the water which is the cause, for it is immediately retained by the chain which covers the hole which is above the cup; concerning which I have recounted to you that you should perforate it in that manner.
And then repeat the procedure the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and remove a small quantity of water, and do this for several days cautiously, and be careful not to remove more than a little water.
But if you fear for the patient and remove a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and abundant sweating in a bath, and exposure to the sun for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, the spleen, and the liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
On the treatment of children born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born whose urinary meatus is not perforated (or the opening is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore, it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, using a very fine probe, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead pin in the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be stimulated, and it will urinate; and then return the pin.
And if you do not place the lead [pin], it is possible that the urine, which goes to that place, will not allow it to close.
But that one whose opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for many days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its place, so it is said, the cause of which is that in those, the one that is born and the opening is below the end of the penis, so that it cannot urinate towards the inner parts, until it elevates the penis with its hand towards the upper parts; and it is not generative, because the semen cannot reach the womb correctly, and it is a very long-lasting illness.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with vigorous traction, and incise the head of the penis at the location of the prepuce with a sharp scalpel, like a feather incision, or that you shave some part, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis and that the opening falls in the middle place as it should.
And beware of the flow of blood in your operation, for that often happens; and stop it with something that absorbs the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Of the whitening which occurs in the prepuce at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis.
This whitening often occurs on the penis and is a swelling of fleshy matter.
And of that, one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
If it is not malignant, you should suspend it with a fine hook and excise it until you have removed it all; then apply to the wound an ointment immersed in Egyptian ointment; and afterwards, treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the whitening is malignant, of a leaden color, then you should apply cautery near its incision and its root.
But if the whitening is on the foreskin of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the whitening is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside, then you should remove the whitening which is inside first, until it is consolidated; and then you treat the outside, because when you treat both at the same time, it is not certain that it will not be damaged.
And if you find in the genitals and foreskin blackness and corruption, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and is about to corrupt or is already corrupted; and then apply to that a poultice of honey, mixed with crushed and sifted flour from pomegranate rind and rye.
And then treat it with another cure until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
Because cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, that is, for bleeding and for the wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you must insert into the opening of the foreskin a lead cannula so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in one whose foreskin is healthy, and circumcision has not been performed; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these exquisitely, then it is necessary that you scrape with a spatula some part of the head of the penis and of the foreskin, and this is because the foreskin, when it is thin, is very easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis with a very thin linen cloth, which has already been wetted in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then let it be treated with styptic wine until it is healed.
Chapter 57.
Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of what happens to those circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is done primarily on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest method leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience, which is why I have found the majority of surgeons and barbers using circumcision and cleansing with a scalpel and with towels; and they use ligation with thread and incision with the nail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with scissors, with ligation with thread than cleansing with the nail, because many times the skin peels off from above, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with an awl, and is digital, which cobblers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not ensured, because it easily enters the hole of it.
But in the operation with a nail, you easily make a mistake and corrupt your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need of cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with scissors and ligatures with thread, the goodness, the experiment reveals to me, because the scissors are of proportional incision, for that reason the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below; and therefore as you put your hand, there are two proportional sharpnesses, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and a compression of the thread is made with a figure containing the foreskin of the glans from every part, with which no error at all occurs.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child stay, especially if it is one of those who understands a little, that you do nothing but tie the thread to its glans only, and leave it until the next day.
And then do that in such a way as is possible for you, considering his understanding. And then make the child lie still between your hands, prepared and not fidgeting; and hide the scissors in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them nor any other of the instruments.
And then put your hand to his glans and blow on the foreskin, and pull it until the head of the glans is exposed, and then cleanse it of whatever filth is attached to it.
The shape of the scissors for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let one end be blunt and the other sharp, so that the nail head does not protrude, and let the length of the two points be equal to the length of two fingers, more or less.
But the error in circumcision is that you too quickly remove the whole inner foreskin, or part of it, from below the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you extend that [foreskin] with your nail before the suppuration of the place and that you incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then pull it with forceps and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the inflamed penis, then you leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and carefully remove the skin, and incise it as you have prepared.
And guard the head of the penis, for that will not harm him.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure from the scrotum, and it obeys the parts above, that will not harm him.
And moreover, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or flesh, and similar things to those we have mentioned in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved by what we have said, and the cause is vehement in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and be a thin, hollow cone, like a bird's quill, with the subtlety of a long ray, in the similitude of a palm and a half long, to which there should be a thin tube at its tip.
And the manner of drawing out the urine with this is that you take a doubled bladder and tie wool or cotton to its end with a good binding; and introduce the ends of the bladder into the lower part of the syringe, and cut with scissors if there is any superfluous wool, but introduce it into the cannula with force. And then lubricate the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and rub their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rosewater.
And then introduce the syringe easily until it reaches the root of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached the empty area, and it is not done according to this order, but the meatus, through which it goes, is tortuous.
And then extend the bladder with the wool little by little, because the urine will wet the wool.
Then extract it and make a cure for the urine, and use a syringe; do not cease to do this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the quality of bladder clysterization with a catheter and with similar instruments which are suitable for this.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or congealed blood in it, or hardened pus, and you want to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a catheter, and this is its form:
except that at its extremity it is blunt, that is, closed. And in it there are three holes: two on one side, thus at times.
In the beginning, it is a concave place, in which that which is expelled is held, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, until when some cause is drawn from the humors with it, it is drawn, and when it is expelled, with that it is drawn, and when it is expelled long, as the catheter does with which naphtha is inserted in sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to draw humors from the bladder, insert the end of the catheter into the humor, and draw with it that which is pressed towards the upper parts, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the urethra as we have recounted in the syringe; and then expel the humor with that which you expel, because that humor immediately reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it.
The form of the subtle catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or tin, of which the upper end should resemble a small feather, and below it a slender tube.
And then take a goat's bladder, and place in it the liquid you want to instill into the bladder, and then tie it tightly between two [things] with a strong double thread, and heat that liquid over the fire.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the penis.
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has already reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and perforate it throughout its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is tightly bound; and then seal the circle in such a way that it is sealed like a [sealed] vessel, after you put into it what you want of liquids, oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with that as you have done with the bladder, and express with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stone and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between a stone generated in the kidneys and a stone generated in the bladder, and their signs.
And we have mentioned the stone in which [one performs] an operation with the hand, and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating that with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that the stone generated in the bladder mostly affects children; and among its signs is that the urine that is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his groin, and often cries out in pain, and is restless; and with this, the anus protrudes in many of those [affected].
And the healing of children from this is easy until they reach fourteen years; and it is difficult to cure in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those [extremes - children and the elderly].
And of that [stone] which is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to that [i.e., more difficult].
Therefore, to arrive at the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we cleanse the patient with a clyster, which will remove all the phlegm that is in his bowels; because this phlegm sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone through its examination.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet up and be massaged and manipulated downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or that it sometimes jumps from another location.
Then make that [patient's body] lie between your hands prepared, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to incline downwards.
And then search for it [the stone] and all of it [the stone and its surroundings] thoroughly.
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately prepare yourself for incision upon him.
And if it does not entirely descend upon your touching, then it is necessary that you anoint with oil your index finger of your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if he is a fully grown young man, and introduce it into his anus. And search for the stone until it is under your finger. And bring it back little by little into the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards towards the place where you will make the incision.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with her hand; and command another assistant that with her right hand she extend the genitals upwards, and with her other hand she hold back the perineum which is below the genitals, in the area where the incision is to be made.
And then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: and cut in that area which is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision is wide and the internal incision narrow, according to the size that the expulsion of the stone allows, and no larger, for you will easily compress with your finger, which is in the anus, the stone during the incision, and it will be expelled without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and rough, which makes their expulsion difficult.
And of those, that which resembles an acorn, and is round, is easily expelled.
Therefore, if it is one with angles and roughness, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not expelled in this way, then you should push on it, or press on it with a suitable instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and do not let it escape; or introduce under it a slender instrument with a curved end.
But if you cannot push on it, then slightly enlarge the opening; and if you see a flow of blood, staunch it with crushed vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then initially place your hand on the opening of the bladder, and then cut on it; and then push it gently towards that; and do similarly if there are many more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is folly to cut it with a large incision, for this causes one of two things to happen to the patient: either death or continuous urinary incontinence, because the area is not entirely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion until it is expelled, or work on its fracture with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over that a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be calmed.
Then lay the patient on their back, and do not unbind the bandage until the third day.
And when you have unbound it, bathe the area with water and plenty of oil, and then treat it with diafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a hot, burnt, and corrosive abscess, and of such appearance as if the blood were frozen in the bladder, and because of it the urine is obstructed (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction thereof.
Then wash the wound with sharp wine, water, and salt, and with a poultice of whatever is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during all the treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and thus the urine is obstructed, then treat it with what I have previously recommended before resorting to incision, for many times through this treatment it has been necessary to resort to incision; and I have proven this, that is, you take a heated iron perforator, of which this is the form:
of triangular extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take bile, and bind the penis below the stone with it so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches the stone. And rotate the perforator with your hand against that stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from the other side; for the urine will immediately be released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, because that is broken, and it will be expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this treatment is not suitable for you for some reason that prevents it, then tie one bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. Then incise upon the stone in that penis between the two bandages. And then extract it. And then untie the bandages and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bandage below the stone except so that it does not return to the bladder, and the other bandage above, because when the bandage is untied near the extraction of the stone, the stone returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for this it is necessary for you, when you tie the bandage above, that you lift the stone to the upper parts or that it return during your procedure, and thus close the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones in women are rarely generated.
But if a stone is found in one of them, then its cure is difficult, and is forbidden by many methods.  (The last part implies that many methods of treatment are contraindicated, because of the difficulty, or that the condition is considered incurable by many.)
One reason is that women easily become virgins again (i.e., their virginity is easily restored; or perhaps referring to a perceived fragility that makes treatment risky).
And the second is that you will not find a chaste woman, or a married woman, who willingly reveals herself to the physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the manual operation.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for stones in women is far from the stone itself, wherefore a deep incision is needed, and in this there is danger.
But if necessity compels you to this, then you must find a female physician who is knowledgeable, and they are rarely found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a skillful and subtle physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who is somewhat skilled in this art.
Then have that woman present, and command her to do everything you instruct, from the initial examination for the stone; the reason is that if she determines the woman is a virgin, then she must insert her finger into her rectum and search for the stone.
Then, if she finds it, grasp the stone with her finger, and then instruct her to make an incision over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then instruct the matron to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with good pressure.
Then, if she finds it, she must carefully manipulate it from the opening of the bladder towards the lower parts, using the sum of her skill until she reaches the root of the matter.
And then incise over it, near the middle of the vagina, near the root of the matter wherever it is stopped, and center the stone in that area, and her finger must not be removed from the stone while holding it below.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert a probe into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size which you know the stone will be removed from it.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore you should know how many types there are of it so that you may signify that which you wish.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and keep it there for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And see that you prepare with you the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you may be aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then place powder on the place and bind it tightly with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will very quickly die. And then treat the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the bleeding has subsided after a few days, and the place has healed, then you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning the incision of a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sheath which is below the scrotum, containing the testicle, and is called the sheath.
And sometimes it is in the proper tunic which nature has prepared for the testicle, so that it appears that there is another testicle; and this is the scrotum between the white sheath which we have mentioned, and this is only fat.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow to the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black and foul-smelling, or a white watery color, and this is the most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white sheath which we have mentioned, then the abscess is round, leaning slightly towards length like the shape of an egg, and it surrounds the testicle, because the moisture contains it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper tunic, then the abscess is round near the testicle and therefore one believes it to be another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the covering of the genitals and the white sheath, then it falls below the feeling/sensation.
And if you want knowledge of the color of the moisture, then you test the color of the moisture in the abscess with a probe, the form of which precedes; and according to what comes out on the probe, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its cure with iron, then it is necessary that we order the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and see his body full.
Then let him be supine on his back on something a little high, and place many cloths underneath him.
Then you sit on his left side, and order the assistant to follow on his right side, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides of the covering of the genitals and to the part of the navel of the abdomen.
Then take a broad spatula and split the covering of the genitals from the middle along its length almost to the pubic bone.
And let the incision be made straight and equally distant from the line that separates the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the white fat included.
And scrape that, and observe, and be careful not to cut into it; and your scraping with which you scrape it, let it be done so that it is suspended with the eggs, and most subtly scrutinize the scraping as much as possible for you.  (This sentence is difficult to translate perfectly due to the archaic medical terms and ambiguous phrasing.  "Suspended with the eggs" likely refers to a delicate, careful approach, possibly relating to anatomical structures near the testicles).
Then perforate the water-filled fat with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the fat to the upper parts; and do not touch the covering of the genitals within, and incise the fat in whatever way is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not very carefully scrutinize its incision, there is no assurance that the water will not return.
But if the egg protrudes from its covering during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the fat, return it inside, and then close the two lips of the covering of the genitals with sutures, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.  ("Egg" here likely refers to a testicle or related structure.)
And if you find the egg corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the suspensory ligament, and extract the egg, and then treat it as we have said.  (Again, "egg" likely refers to a testicle.)
But if the fluid is collected in two separate parts, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that part in the same way that you did the other; and if it seems to you that it is a single operation, then you perform it.
And then you shall wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread this over the genitals and the miracle of the belly; and place over it doubled cloths and powders, and bind them over with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then let two cloths be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and let the ends be made with which it is bound of cotton or damp wool, and let them be attached with a bandage in the waistband of the breeches, and one of the ends shall reach from the buttocks to the groin, and the second shall reach to the part of the scrotum, and two ends over the two thighs, and two other ends over the two knees, and the whole bandage shall be adjusted in the waistband of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have recounted until the white cyphus containing the water is uncovered, and then you take a cautery according to this form: and it resembles the Greek letter.
And then perforate the cyphus with it, and ignite it until all the humidity is expelled.
And then stretch the cyphus with forceps, and scarify it with forceps, and scarify it with a thin ignited cautery; and incise it as much as possible until you eradicate all of it; and beware of the egg that the fire does not touch it.
And know that this operation is safer and causes less blood flow, and is better than an operation with incision.
But if an abscess forms contrary to your expectations during the incision or cauterization, or there is excessive bleeding, then you must cure whatever opposes you in this, with a treatment that is appropriate to it as described.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer perforation as I recommend it; and it is when you are certain, through what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should make the patient sit on some elevated seat, then perforate the abscess at its lowest part with a broad spatula, and place the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough that all the water drains out.
And then place a cotton cloth over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water may drain. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the drainage of the water, at that time you should perforate it: and this is done only because the white panniculus at the opening of the wound causes resistance and prevents the drainage of the water; then you should insert into the wound a probe or instrument with which water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which has been described previously; or adjust a small [opening] in the obstruction of the wound.
And know that the water will return, and it will accumulate again within about six months or thereabouts; and when it has accumulated, then let it be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus spend his days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is a danger leading to death in most cases; therefore, in my opinion, its removal and being saved by that [method] is better.
And I am recalling the operation on that [hernia] and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the bodies of which the genitals are composed, and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, acrid superfluity, which is poured into the genitals, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a lapified abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by inflammation of these, so that its appearance is perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we compress it with our fingers; and it is not advisable that one touch it.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any means through compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision is made on this area and on the other tissues; and it is so that you incise the tunic of the genitals, and then extend the testicle to the upper parts, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament of the vessels, and ligate them, and incise the suspensory ligament after you free it from every part of the parts of the testicle.
Therefore, if the testicle is consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then you must extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the sheath, or between that which is between the vessels, then you must free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh at the site of the adhesion which is behind, then you must incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a hernia that is of the scrotum.
A scrotal hernia is an abscess enveloped by some covering similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is necessary to consider what preceded it.
However, we must describe the operation in the same way that the first physicians did.
And I say that you must have the patient sit on a raised seat; then gently push the suspensory ligament of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers, along with the vessels that are felt near the penis; and have another assistant hold and stretch those parts forcefully.
And then incise with a sharp, broad scalpel, making a transverse incision directly over the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape the entire area as we have told you in the extraction of arrowheads which are lodged in the temples.
And then insert a double-threaded needle into those [vessels], and tie it first at the place where you cut the veins, and tie it again at the other end. And then incise those [vessels] in the middle lengthwise with a straight incision, and extract whatever is accumulated of foul and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds where you want healing to be generated, so that the vessels which nourish one of the two genitalia may fall [back into place], for this is not harmful.
But if you cut all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed or that the testicles be tied off with the vessels, so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they wither, or that they be tied off so that there is no benefit from them.
Chapter 65.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a rupture that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen, on the side of the inguinal rings of the abdominal wall, causing the intestines to descend through that opening.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur from many causes: a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, or similar.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and not suddenly, and there is an inguinal abscess near the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that it initially causes severe pain suddenly; and there is a different abscess appearing under the skin near the groin, and this is due to the protrusion of the intestine, and its body is outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is expelled along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" is likely a variant or corruption of a term related to the omentum or its appearance).
And sometimes it is formed with flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and is retained there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
And in the treatment of the types of this illness, iron is feared, therefore it is necessary to avoid cauterization in this case.
And the method of operating on this is that you command the patient to reduce the intestine with his hand to the inside of its cavity if it obeys its return, and then he should be placed on his side between your hands, and raise his legs.
And then hold the spermatic cord which is the cord of the testicles upwards, and incise the spermatic cord entirely lengthwise; and then insert into the two lips of the incision hooks, as I instructed, to open the incision with them.
And if the incision allows, as much as is possible for you, that the egg [testicle] may be expelled from it.
And then scrape away the coverings which are under the spermatic cord, until the hard white tunic of each part is uncovered.
Then you introduce your finger into that which is the testicle, into that which is between the white tunic, which is under the cord of the testicle, and between the second tunic, and separate with it the adhesions which are in the part behind the testicle.
And then gently manipulate the spermatic cord upwards with your hand, and with this extend the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunic towards the incision; and command the assistant to extend the testicle upwards, and you dissolve the adhesions which are behind with complete resolution.
And search with your fingers that there is no intestinal matter enveloped in the hard white tunic. But if you find any such matter, then you push it back down into the abdomen.
And then incise in the area below the spermatic cord, through an incision from which blood and pus will flow as we have recounted in what we have said.
And then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have described (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we mentioned near its incision to prevent bleeding, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed in warm water, and keep it there until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
Of a windy hernia (or,  Of a ventosity hernia).  The term "ventosa" here likely refers to a hernia accompanied by gas or air.
In this type of hernia, I have not seen anyone who has been healed by using iron (i.e., cautery or surgery with iron instruments).
And the first [physicians] said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with [or accompanied by] pus; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that [hernia] with ease; and then dry the middle area around the abscess with that which opens it, until the vessels fall (or collapse).
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the rupture that is made in the inguinal region (groin).
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and it swells the area.
And it does not allow the genitals any cause of the intestines in the genitals; and if it does, it is little; and it returns in all hours (meaning it keeps returning).
But if the time with this is prolonged, a fissure is formed in the inguinal canal until the intestine descends into the inguinal canal; and this happens because of the stretching of the inguinal canal, which is in the groin as we have said, which causes the inguinal canal to be stretched, and then it is softened and the area becomes inflamed and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as its narrative has preceded. (Meaning:  The cure is cauterization, as previously described.)
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with an incision in width according to the amount of three fingers.
And then tighten the white inguinal canal that is under the scrotum until it is uncovered.
And then take the ray (presumably a surgical instrument) and place it on the prominent part of the inguinal canal, and press it against the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent places on the end of the inguinal canal's ray (instrument), and join one to the other with suture.
And then remove the end of the ray (instrument), and do not completely incise the inguinal canal, nor extend the wound, nor anything else like what I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat that with the treatment of wounds, and as you incise the tissues, clean it and restore the wound until it is consolidated; because the inguinal canal is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not adjusted.
And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to health (i.e., a more effective treatment).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the scrotum.
Many times the scrotum in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and its appearance is spoiled.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is charged with his cure to make the patient lie down according to his condition, and to sew up all the scrotum which is softened onto the natural scrotum; and then to join the two lips with a suture.
And if you wish, sew up the excess of the softened scrotum first with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then make incisions between the sutures; and then care for it with the treatment for other wounds until it is healed and the threads fall out.
Chapter 69.
On castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but it is permitted for me to mention it in this book for a reason; and its mention is necessary only in two ways, one of which is so that it is within the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, so that he knows how to treat someone who has undergone it; and the other way is that we often have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit, such as goats, rams, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion, or by incision.
But in that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is that we make the animal sweat in hot water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and grasp the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise each testicle with an incision until both testicles protrude.
And then incise those after you have skinned each one. And do not place any substance on those of the cyphus (likely referring to a type of surgical instrument or wound), except for the fine cyphus which is on the vessels.
And this method of castration is better, which is done by crushing, because strong crushing leaves little substance of the testicles behind, so that the animal desires coitus less.
And then care for the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
Concerning the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two kinds: one is where it appears that there is a space in the place of the testicles, in that which is between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that space which is in the place of the testicles.
But in women, there is one type: and it is that the woman's vulva above the mons pubis is like two men's testicles, somewhat diminished in the outer part, like the foreskin of a man and two testicles.
And the cure is of three kinds: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those tightened tissues until the constriction is released, and then that you treat those with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows that is in the area of the testicles, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Concerning swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A slight swelling is often caused by natural reasons until it is pressed and examined; and sometimes it is enlarged in some women to such an extent that it is spread like in men and extends to the penis.
Then it is necessary that you hold the excess swelling with your hand or with a bandage and incision.
And do not overdo the incision, especially near the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
And then treat it with wound treatments until it is healed.
Moreover, a fleshy growth is flesh that grows in the mother's womb until it fills it, and it quickly protrudes outwardly resembling a tail (and for this reason some first called this "tailed disease"); therefore, it is necessary that we incise it as we incise a swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of arthritis.
Alratica is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or the opening is small. And this is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by improperly formed flesh or by a subtle or thick septum.
And it is formed either in the anterior part of the vagina, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part, and it prohibits coitus, and conception, and childbirth, and very quickly it prohibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by examining the uterus; if the obstruction is apparent, that is sufficient; but if it is not apparent, then you must search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin septum, and it is close to the two labia, then you cut and break it up.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place the index fingers of both hands together.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then forcefully spread the two labia until that thin septum is broken and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and keep it moist all day so that the incised area does not close up.
But if the septum is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to flesh, then lift it with a hook, and incise it.
And have with you the medicines that stop bleeding without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and enses, mixed with egg white.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close up too quickly.
And keep it there for a few days and administer a poultice of dry herbs.
And then it should be treated with the other consolidation cure until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the mother's birth of other flesh [likely referring to a difficult childbirth or postpartum complication], and then it is necessary to incise in this manner. But if this is due to a cranial abscess, the cranial abscess which is in the mother should not be treated with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and of a boil or red swelling that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the orifices of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and when they are old hemorrhoids, they become boils.
And I have already mentioned in the division the types of these and their signs, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the womb and do not appear externally, then in those cases no treatment should be done with iron (i.e., cautery or surgery).
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which one feels them, are those which are cured.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cold place and then extend the boil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and incise them to the roots.
And then sprinkle on those boils the flow of blood with one of the incisive powders without biting, such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place her in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of  summach and myrtle bark and  woad and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to his back.
And if the blood is withdrawn, it is good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, and to the nipples without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in comfrey juice or in ivy juice with red wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Of the perforation of a wound by accident in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses happen in the mother,  such as cancer, and stony abscesses, and ulcerous ones, and buboes, and herpes, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and fissures, and boils, and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses and their types and their signs, and their cures in the division (or section).
And it is necessary that I speak in this treatise of a hot abscess which comes in the mother when it is among the abscesses which collect pus; and if you wish to know in what manner the operation is done with iron.
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute with throbbing and phlegm and fever, and sometimes redness and if the sensation comes upon it. Then do not attempt perforation, but cure it with what helps maturation until the acuteness of the symptoms ceases.
And then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a stool that has two legs; and let her recline on her back and adjust her feet to the lower part of her abdomen, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and tie each with a suitable bandage.
And then the midwife follows from the right side and administers the instrument with which the orifice of the womb is opened, the form of which will come in those things which will be done next.
And it is necessary, when you wish to administer this instrument, that you place with the ray the neck of the woman's womb, and that which of the instrument is entered into the womb should be no more than the neck of the womb and harm the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the neck of the womb, then it is necessary that you place powders on the texture of the neck of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the neck of the womb is prevented.
And it is necessary that you place the vertigine [likely referring to a rotating or twisting action or device] that runs in the instrument from the upper side, and that the attendant hold the instrument and rotate the vertigine until the orifice of the womb is opened.
And when the wound appears, and it is touched with the hand and is soft and moist, then it is necessary that you dry that wound with a broad sponge.
And when the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary that you place in the wound a wick submerged in rose oil or green oil in which there is some astringency; and place the calca [likely referring to a type of poultice or dressing] in the section in the neck of the womb.
And place outside the womb and over the vulva clean wool submerged in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then it should be treated for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is cleansed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lilies or of birthwort has been boiled, and then it returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is deep inside the enclosed womb, then you must be prohibited from treating it with iron, taking care with that which we have said in the section [presumably a previous section of the treatise].
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner live embryos should be treated when they emerge in an unnatural way/position.
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the form of natural childbirth by its signs, and it is that when you see the woman strain in the lower parts and desire to smell the air, and moreover is lightened by that which is above her of the birth, and hastens the emergence of the embryo, then you should know that this birth is according to natural form, and it is the emergence of the child head first, and the afterbirth with it or suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily because when it descends head first, the afterbirth descends with it, and is cleansed of those superfluities with good purification/cleaning.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and undesirable, for when the embryo is emerged feet first and its body is emerged before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and hand, or its belly, and quickly is turned upon its neck,  and similar to these undesirable forms.
Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these matters, and to guard herself from error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is involved in them so that it may be signified thereby and may be established thereupon.
When the fetus has emerged head first by natural effort, and this is arduous for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her vulva with cooked fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, spatula-shaped instrument between her labia and with it tears the secundine, or scrapes it with her fingernail until it is free of moisture. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be given a clyster of mallow and fenugreek mucilage with anise.
Then, after the clyster, instruct her to be compressed and make her sneeze with sneezing powder; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled first, then you must gently reduce them little by little. But if it does not obey the introduction, then place the woman on a stool and raise her feet, and then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned inside and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remains of the fetus, or tie the body to its hand with a cloth and extract it carefully, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is on its feet, then you must push them upwards, and gently turn the fetus, and gently grasp it, and gently take one foot and extend it little by little.
But when it has come out between the thighs, then you command her to strain, and make her sneeze forcefully, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for then it will be expelled easily.
And if it is hindered by all that we have recounted, then take marshmallow mucilage and dissolved gum, and pound everything well in a mortar, and gently apply this to the woman's vulva, at the very bottom of her belly. And gently make her sit in lukewarm water, until it reaches her hypochondria (the area below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts of her are softened, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and place it under her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and gently make her sneeze and hold her breath, and lift her up, and press the lower part of her belly with gentle pressure, for the fetus will soon be expelled.
Thus [deliver] the fetus laterally, holding [it with] one of your hands. Try to reduce [the dislocation] with your hand; but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her hips with a vehement shaking, and then apply bandages which I have recommended made of mucilage.
And if childbirth has begun, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction of the hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural shape, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain until it is expelled.
Thus [deliver] the fetus over the neck, spreading your hands, and its face is towards its mother. It is necessary that the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then turn it little by little, and that she does this easily.
And when it is grasped, then place on its head that which we have recommended of oil and mucilage.
And then instruct her to cough little by little, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and instruct her to lean on her right side, and then instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze with a potion. The prepared fetus exits on its side.
When the horror of the mother subsides according to this manner, consider, and then you incise the secundine with your nail until it is evacuated of its humidity.
And if the fetus is suspended over its face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it is not retained and dies.
And then gently push the fetus inwards until you place it as it should be, and tell the woman to strain several times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and seldom happens; but there are causes for this in nature, and they do not live.
And they share one placenta, even if they are multiples, and are separated by a septum, distinguishing them within the umbilical ligament of each. And sometimes they are expelled naturally and easily, as if it were a single fetus, and sometimes they are expelled unnaturally, as we have recounted.
And if any of them are difficult to deliver and it comes to what we have said about unnatural births, then you should treat them as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and dexterity, and with patience, and is resourceful according to each case as she is prepared by her skill leading to health.
Concerning that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even more than ten are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which was determined by the measurement of glorious wise men.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife because it easily appears similar to her, and therefore she opposes it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
Concerning the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it has not yet been expelled, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted with any of the accidents that make loss feared for her.
Then the woman should be placed on the bed on her back, with her head inclined downward and her hips raised.
And the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
Then you moisten the mother's vulva with warm oils and with a mucilage of mallow, fenugreek, and linseed.
Then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the location where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you consider if the fetus is positioned to descend head-first, and then you grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or neck, or mouth, or palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the areas near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then at the heel or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary that you hold the umbilical cord with your right hand, and place its curve in the space between the fingers of your left hand, and gently insert your hand and grasp the umbilical cord in one of those places which we have mentioned, until you reach the empty amniotic sac.
Then add and place another umbilical cord section, or a third if necessary, alongside it, so that there is even traction, and not only extension along its straight length.
Rather, let it be pulled evenly from all sides, so that its extraction is eased, just as is done with a tooth before its extraction.
And it is necessary in this matter that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and expertly insert them and loosen what is retained with them.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is expelled, then let the umbilical cords be moved to a higher position; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if one hand is delivered before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then pull it out until it is completely delivered, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the wrist.
And thus you should do with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction occurs during its delivery, or there is accumulated water on its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a spiny spatula and puncture the head and extract the water, or to open it with an instrument that is called an "alundat," the form of which will come with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is near this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: and then it is necessary to incise it with a scalpel, or to grasp it with the alundat as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is delivered but constricted below the clavicle, then it should be incised so that the fluid which is in the chest is drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor does it obey delivery, then you incise the head immediately as much as is possible for you.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed or dropsical, then it is necessary that you perforate it so that the fluid that is in it drains.
But if the fetus is positioned feet first, then its extraction is easier and its direction towards the mother's opening is easier.
But if it is constricted around the belly and chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you will have wrapped around your hand, and that you incise the belly and chest so that what is inside them drains.
But if the other limbs are outside and the head remains inside, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's opening is open, then she inserts her hand into the womb, and with it searches for the head, and pulls it with her fingers towards the mother's opening, and then inserts into it one or two fingers, and pulls it out with them.
And if the mother's opening is constricted by a hot abscess which harms her, then it must not be disturbed; instead, it is necessary to administer an infusion of moist, oily substances. And apply plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is lying on its side, then, if possible, it should be turned; and what we have said should be administered as for a living fetus.
And if that is not possible, then let it be cut into pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that you leave no part of the afterbirth inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said concerning the treatment of hot abscesses which may befall the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after, she became pregnant again, and soon after that, the fetus also died. A long time ago, an abscess occurred in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters of strong attraction to him, and I drew out a bone, and after a few days, I drew out another bone; and I was very surprised, since there should be no bones in the belly.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from him, the woman being in her menses, and she lived in this manner for a long time, a little pus being discharged from it.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but because in this there is science and help that the skilled physician administers with his hand for a cure.
Of the forms of instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
The form of incision with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the lips are joined, to which joining there are two incisions at the two extremities of two poles/rods. However, this incision should be more subtle than the constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each rod be two fingers, and the thickness of each be one finger, and the length of each be a palm and a half; and in the middle space between the two rods there are two fastenings of the same wood, which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the mother so that it is opened with them when you turn the two prescribed incisions.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, similar in appearance to forceps. However, at its extremity there are two additions like prongs, and the length of these additions is about a palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with these, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, having opened what is between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with scissors, gradually, according to how much you want to open the mouth of the womb until the midwife does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The form of the impellent by which the fetus is expelled:
The form of the hindrance by which the large head is obstructed.  (The "2" likely represents a superscript or annotation not relevant to the meaning).
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like tongs, and sometimes it is made long like forceps of this shape, like tongs, which have teeth like saw teeth, with which it is incised and extracted. Form of slight obstruction/hindrance:
The form of a hook having a spine/spike.
The form of a hook having two spines/spikes.
The form of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed/cut.
The form of two broad spatulas.
All those instruments are exercised, and when the types of those are more multiplied and prepared by the artisans, then it is easier in its operation and more abundant among men due to its quantity.
And do not neglect those instruments, whatever they may be, which are prepared by you, for the necessity of them is not excusable.
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should instruct the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and press your hand on her mouth and nose, and if by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid and place herbs in it, opening the mother's mouth;  such as rue, and mint, and chamomile, and Arabian scabious, and cassia lignea, and  holy thistle. All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed tube in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb.
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if after this treatment it remains and is not expelled, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or marshmallow poultice, and then introduce it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it; and when it is found, then take it and extract it little by little. But if it is attached to the uterus of the mother, then introduce her hand as we have recommended, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as instructed so that the mother does not faint from the strong pulling. Afterwards, it should be turned to the right and left sides easily.
And if the mother's mouth (cervix) is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and herbal oil medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the means we have recommended, then take care not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction. However, what has emerged from her into the mother's mouth (cervix) should be left attached to the woman's genitals, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrapharmacum; for that will cause it to rot in a few days and it will be dissolved and expelled.
But when it rots, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then fumigations appropriate for this should be administered.
But some of the Ancients already approved of fumigation with hellebore and dried figs.
Method of instrumentation with which a woman is fumigated because of retained menses and secundines:
Let it be made of glass or brass.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation be placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold that until that fumigation is consumed and repeat with another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that stricture with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [likely referring to lead-based ointments].
Concerning the treatment of fistulas that develop below [presumably, in the anal region].
The fistulas that develop in the lowest part below are knots and swellings which develop near the anus externally or in the space between the parts.
And it is one fistula or several.
And when that swelling is longstanding and discharges a watery white fluid or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because of what comes out of them through discharge and by flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from discharge, and worms readily emerge from them.
And some of these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the space, into the bladder, and into the meatus of the penis; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the anus from one that is not penetrating, is that you insert your finger into the anus, and insert a thin probe of lead or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert into it a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything proceed from the opening, neither discharge, nor worms, nor flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then attend to its treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meatus of the penis, then the sign of it is thus, urine from that [area], and prohibition of it [the area] so that the place may be consolidated with medicine.
But if it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then the sign of it is that the probe penetrates thus far if there is no tortuosity in it into the bone, and causes pain in the surrounding area; and that there is always pus from it; and that medication does not help it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas there is no certain cure, and the treatment of those is the work and vanity of foolish physicians, on which they are fixated.
But in that which is not penetrating and not ancient, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I shall recommend to you, and this I have already proven.
And it is that the patient lies between your hands on his back and raises his legs towards you, his thighs being inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe penetrates.
And if the patient feels it around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe itself penetrating on your finger, besides what you feel between your finger and that fistula or flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on that, for there is no cure in that, as we have said.
However, some say that it is healed in some men slowly/later.
And the medication by which help is hoped for him is that you ignite a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been explained before, and introduce that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat that two or three times until you know that all those fistulous, fleshy parts that resemble a bird's feather quill are cauterized.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen until all those cauterized tissues slough away, and then treat it with flesh-generating and consolidating medicines, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it will not be healed at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or fistula, and you see the fistula where it is the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it drying with the probe, and let it be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the tip of the probe arrives, and through the probe it is released and removed.
And then cleanse those fistulous tissues which resemble a bird's feather quill, and let no part of them remain.
But if you see a flow of blood coming between you and your operation when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good things: that is, the cauterization of those affected tissues, and the stanching of blood and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed flaxseed until the place becomes firm, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate hard flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and desiccation; when then it is restored, it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and is distant from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and explore with it.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a veil of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation there except through hope and trust (i.e., it's too risky to operate).
Which condition is treated in one of three ways: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that you can introduce the poultices and the treatment is close; and do not proceed much with incision lest you cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that such happen to the patient without their will; and then treat it with what we have said for it will heal quickly; or lengthen that veil and clean it  after drying it near the rectum, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument of sharp end, and then cleanse those fistulous areas which are in the incision where you can with escharotics; and then strive to make the restoration of the whole wound with incision, and if the upper opening is not healed, and the fistula remains open in the part of the rectum, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the anus near the surface of the body with the tail and in the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing skins in this form:
and insert it into that [fistula] wrapped in five threads or around those; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it penetrates into the margin of the rectum inwards, then you extract the thread from that hole so that you can insert your finger into the rectum; and extract the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for one or two days, and when you cut the thread into the flesh, tighten it well so that those areas of flesh are cut which are between the two ends of the thread and that they fall away.
And then treat the wound until it is healed and consolidated.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, however it is prepared for you, except that it should be in the perineum, for it is not for you to do this so that you do not cut the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The form of a pointed probe with which the fistula is probed:  its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks similar to charcoal, or they are like grape seeds. And of these, some are small and some are large, and blood flows from them constantly, and there is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are according to the months of little humidity, from which flows a citrine fluid or a little blood with continuous flow, and it is according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to strain and to express himself until the anus protrudes and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should grasp and lift them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks cannot grasp them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with rough cloth or cotton or a wad of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle on them some hot powders at the incision, so that they act on them in place of cautery; or cauterize them as is previously described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not obey in its protrusion, then stimulate the patient with a mild laxative, and let it be washed with that which is in the anus and which will easily come out when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and it is that you should grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, it is necessary to suture it in this manner: take waxed thread and insert it into a needle and then draw the hemorrhoid to the upper parts, and make it penetrate with the needle to the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and it is done laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong suture, and then tie off the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them uncut, so that the excess blood may flow from that one.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that on the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointment or with another cure until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that you scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moistened and the crust is removed from them, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are consolidated.
Then remove them with more force than the first time until they bleed a lot and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that felon, that is, a whitlow, is nothing but a red swelling, according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a clove, and it is found throughout the body and especially in the parts below the feet and fingers, and causes pain due to its swelling.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the whitlow be incised, and held with forceps or an instrument, and eradicated from its root; and then treat it.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously explained in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and often appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is that you stretch and incise it, or that you bind it tightly with thread or a hair so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize that, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic).
But a mole is a small, hairy or fistulated, thick eminence on the surface of the body, growing often in the pubic area, and when it is rubbed, it is felt like the bite of an ant; and it is found all over the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose quill or vulture feather, and let it be strong, and place that over the mole so that the circle of the cannula contains it; and then move your hand with the cannula so that you incise what is in the circumference of the mole, and place that in the depth of the flesh, and that you eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula, according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn to a point, blunt (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the grip on it is eased and its rotation facilitated.
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as previously described in the cauterization of athel in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the instruments that are used to perform a christening (or possibly, a surgical incision/cauterization – the meaning depends on the broader context of the text).
Sometimes a christening (or incision/cauterization) instrument is made of silver, or lead, or cast or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made in small and large sizes according to those to whom it is administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are fragile or painful, the instruments for them should be small.
The form of the large and small christening (incision/cauterization) instrument:
The head of the cannula above, to which the pouch is attached, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinction where the pouch is attached, as you see.
And the lower extremity, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (that is, not open) but rounded, tapering to a point; and on one side of it there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the size of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And the pouch, in which the medicines are placed, should be made of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its length should be one palm (handspan).
And it should be perforated with many holes, as it is coiled; and the space between the holes should be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong, raw flax thread, about ten threads or so; and attach the pouch with it; and when the pouch is placed in position, tighten it at the head of the clyster with two distinct, strong ligatures, and then cauterize each hole with this.  The method of cauterizing with this is that you fill the pouch with medicine that is warmed according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs and place a cushion underneath him, on which there is a mat or linen cloth; and then anoint the end of the clyster with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or something similar; and then insert it into the anus easily, and then the attendant should take the pouch and squeeze it with both hands and forcefully until everything in the clyster is evacuated into the bowels; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers his legs.
And if the medicine forces a bowel movement, retain it as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is even more beneficial.
But if you use this clyster for diseases of diarrhea and the bowel movement is frequent, then repeat the cauterization until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin and small, like those with which infants are given clysters.
On the treatment of wounds.
I have already said in the division on the treatment of wounds what was appropriate to the book, and I say thus the treatment of those with hand and with medicines according to the fulfillment/situation.  (The "fulfillment" here likely refers to the specific circumstances of the wound).
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what the wounds are made with and according to the place upon which the wounds fall.
And the causes for which wounds are often made are thus:  a stone throw, or an incision from a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a club, or with an arrow, or similar things of many causes.
But the wounds that are in the places of the body are thus: a wound which falls upon the head, or neck, or feet, or belly, or thigh, and similar to those of the other limbs.
And I am recounting the treatment of certain wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or the like, and only the scalp is wounded and it is a large wound and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you should immediately bleed him and phlebotomize the cephalic vein without delay; and extract blood accordingly, according to the patient's strength, unless some other reason prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has come from the wound is little.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and coarse foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his diet be reduced and he should not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in him, a pledget soaked in plain rose oil or in wine in which a styptic has been dissolved.
But if a hot abscess is certain, then place on the wound, if it is recent,  its own blood and the powder which I shall shortly recount, before the air has altered it.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is from a sword cut or similar, and its lips are not approximated by themselves, then approximate them with sutures according to the manner of suturing I shall recount.
But if the wound has already exposed bone and hangs, and there is no retention of it but a slight suspension, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in place of the bone, and order the patient to be fed on foods which are rich in thickness: heads and things of similar consistency, until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood may occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you should investigate the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you to not do what we have said, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is light; thus you sprinkle this powder on them, for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
And the manner of making the powder is this: take oil of roses one part, dragon's blood two parts, burnt alum three parts; let all be very finely ground and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be bound with a good bandage until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with powders and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is thus, unless it is abscessed, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes this alone suffices, when you do not have roses and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary to place it on them and they are fresh wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially if it is in summer, then this powder is not suitable, but treat them with what we have said, so that you place on them some digestive ointments, or that you put on them powder from barley flour with water and honey until they stop festering; and then treat them with another cure until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with forceps.
And I will describe the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the neck wounds.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a simple head wound.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are incised, then if it is a nerve, there is nothing to do but to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as vitriol or similar substances, because they harm the nerves and contract them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with light medicines, such as washing the wound with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and then, after washing with fresh water, applying other minor ointments in this manner, and moist unguents.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or approximate its edges, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or pus collects in the lowest part, then perforate it at the lowest point.
But if an artery is incised in the wound and bleeding results, then separate or cut it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
But if the vertebrae of the neck or any have been incised, and the veins of the neck are spared, then you should approximate the edges of the wound with sutures over the cervical spine and do not touch it; first align it and reduce it to its natural shape, and then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for some days; and then treat it with ointments which contain styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has damaged the bone, then clean it, and then if there are bone fragments, extract all those that you can; and what you cannot reach, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated and the injury is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle upon it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be recalled in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a venting of air from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you should place on it at the first hour a powder, and do not bind it tightly lest the blood be retained in its depth and return to the heart and kill the patient; but rather place on it an attractive ointment, and unbind it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then you place on the opening of the wound old linen so that it may draw out that which is of the humors; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that that which is contained within it may flow out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it has not caused the patient spasms or trembling of the heart or constriction of the throat, and you see the other good dispositions of him, then know that the wound is safe; and then cure it with cauterizations and with other treatments until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore cure that according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or hand, then treat it with what is prescribed for suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if there is damage to the bone, and pieces have been broken off from it, then you should probe the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound matures, so that their extraction is easier.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the treatment is the same as what we have described.
Of the wounds of the abdomen.
The ailment which occurs in the abdomen is either great, small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it is so that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of their replacement immediately, because it opens and swells, making its insertion difficult.
Therefore, a moderate rupture is best, for in that case the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in the two previously mentioned types.
And know that the suturing of the abdomen is according to four methods, but two sutures are common which are suitable for the suturing of other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures specific to the abdomen are also applicable to other wounds, but are nonetheless more suitable for suturing the abdomen.
And I will recount to you each one with explanation and clarification.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has protruded through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is due to one of two reasons: either because of the small size of the rupture as we have said, or because the intestine has become inflamed due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil in water squinant, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with this until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes it is done with wine, which has astringent properties, and is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
And so when you see the inflammation resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the re-entry of it is eased with little effort.
But if its re-entry is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is appropriate that there is no incision, and there is no need to worry about dryness and debilitation.
Concerning the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part is not sharp, and the end is thin, but not as thin as a spatula; rather, it should be somewhat blunt.
And thus, when the wound is enlarged and the intestine protrudes, then its reduction should follow its natural form, to its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is large, and is in the lower part of the abdomen, then you should make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then you should raise their head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, then always direct your attention and consideration to ensuring that the side where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, place what you have prepared, and then have the assistant place their compassionate hands between your hands, holding the entire rupture with their hand and adjusting its lips, and then reveal from one to the other whether the suture needs anything else.
And this is the common method of suturing:  first, take a needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then, leaving the width of an annular finger from the edge of the rupture, grasp the needle, being careful not to insert the thread into both ends of the wound simultaneously, but rather use two ends of the thread (ciphac) located below the wound, until you have made it penetrate that part; and you will have joined two ends of the thread and two ends of the ciphac, and thus four ends are made.
Then, tie with a double thread in the loop of the needle, sometimes from two sides together, and then join the two edges of the wound with a proper joining; and then leave the width of a finger and insert another needle in that place, and then tie that with thread as you did with the first needle; and do not cease doing this with needles as necessary until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, for thin needles injure the flesh too easily; and thick needles are difficult to insert into the wound, therefore they should be of moderate thickness.
And it is not necessary that the needle be inserted too deeply into both ends of the wound, lest the flesh be too readily injured and the wound reopen before it heals.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be prevented from healing.
Then, sharpen the ends of the needles so that they do not prick the patient during their sleep; and place on the suture finely powdered material, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave those in place until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient for small wounds, because one or two needles, or thereabouts, are sufficient for their closure.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you sew together the four ends of the wound, and the two ends of the lip (or edge), at once, with a needle around which thread is wrapped,  uniform in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have passed the needle through these four ends, return the needle to the same side from which you began, so that the drawn thread goes from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is like the sewing of cloth, by which cloths are strengthened.
And place between each suture the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up the wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than a palm, and the intestines had protruded about two palms from the middle of the wound, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and moreover, he lived for many years after, and remained in good health.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle that he was, for I did not cure him with ointment, for it was in a place where no ointment or any medicine was found, but I placed old linen on the wound twice a day and washed it frequently with honey water until it was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper, according to the account of Galen. (Assuming "Paraula" is a misspelling or variant of Galen)
And it is that you begin with the suture of the "codena" (likely referring to a type of stitch or suture technique), and insert the needle from the outside to the inside.
And then, as the needle penetrates the codena and that same laceration, both straight and along the whole length of the body, leave the end of the thread into which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And then, when you have made that penetration, then you make that needle penetrate again in that same extremity of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other extremity from the inside to the outside.
And make the needle penetrate with that penetration with which you make it penetrate the thread at the extremity of the wound which is on his side until all of it penetrates.
And then begin on that same side and sew that with the end of the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the "codena" which it penetrated, and then return that into that "codena" and sew the end of the thread that is on the other side with that extremity of the wound; and extract that from the "codena" which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this one time then another time until you sew all that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a suture of skins, with which you sew skins, in such a way that you sew the thread once from the side of the extremity of the "codena", and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second type of suture, which is properly called, and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the similarity with which some physicians sew it, in such a way that they join each part to its corresponding part naturally; and apply the end of one to the other, and the end of the wound to the other end, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you place the needle in the extremity of the wound nearest you, on the outside part, and make it penetrate to the inside part in that sole [area], and leave two extremities of the thread; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in the two extremities of the thread.
And then turn each of them, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in two other extremities of the wound which are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which I previously made mention.
This is the discourse of Galien (Galen).
And moreover, some say, the suture of the abdomen is rectified with two needles, that is, that you introduce into each of these a thread, and begin with the introduction of the needle from what is nearest you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew leathers similarly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen.
But the judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you treat a fresh wound with its blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and sew it and prepare it properly, then place an incarnative powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some ointments which are at your disposal until they form a hard scab and the threads fall out, and they are consolidated with cyprus and myrrh; and then treat it as the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then immediately place on it, as soon as it begins to discharge pus, old linen, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it is healed, for you will not need other medication in many situations when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread to the principal members, then it is necessary that you soak linen in olive oil of good quality, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the place which is between the armpits and below the shoulders.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in his intestines, for many times this happens, then cauterize it with warm, black astringent wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that that which is in the large intestine is of easier healing than that which is in the small intestines.
And it is of difficult healing because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive healing from a wound that falls upon it at all; and this is because of the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of their magnitude in those, and because of the subtlety of the body of that, and because of the proximity of that to the nature of nerves.
But if that which proceeds from the wound is the web, and you obtain that recently, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines equally.
But if it has passed to that space and has already become green or black, then that you bind it with a thread over the place that is blackened by it, so that a flow of blood comes, because in the web are veins and arteries.
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of the thread hanging down from the part below the wound outside it, so that the attraction of it downwards from the fall of the web and the emission of the arm of the wound may be relieved on you.
A remembrance/reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a disruption occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some men, because of this, for I saw one who had been wounded in his belly with a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was ancient and made a fistula, and from it issued a discharge and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his healing, but I continued to refine it until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
And I, after I saw the place consolidated, feared for the patient that some accident might befall him in his belly; and no ill accident befell him because of this, and he remained in his usual habits eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and was exercised in his movements.
And some experienced ones have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine, and it is small, then it should be tied according to this manner: and it is that you take ants with large heads; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, which has its mouth open, upon the two lips of the wound; then when it bites and grips with its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not dissolve.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease doing this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the entire wound.
And then cover that and sew the wound; and those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and no harm will come to the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with fine thread which is made from the gut of an animal, since it is thinner than a needle; and it is that you take the end of this gut thread, and it should be very clean, and then tie its end with the thread, wrapped, and then insert that thread into a needle and sew the intestine with it, and then reduce it into the rupture.
And this method of suturing with ants is only a matter of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, because then it is only a reduction, and not a complete healing.
Concerning the treatment of a fistula.
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whatever member it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we call that a fistula.
And a fistula, in truth, is a hardened, white, knotted formation, without pain, which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and therefore it is called a claw-like ulcer, that is, a claw.
And in some men it is moist, discharging pus; and very quickly the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; sometimes thick, and sometimes thin.
I have already shown all those causes, and their signs, and their cure with medicines, in the division [of the text/treatise].
And it is necessary that I make known to you the cure of a fistula, which is done by means of an operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those that cause damage near a principal member are similar.
Therefore, of these fistulas, the one that is according to this manner is one of the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive a cure, and to occupy oneself with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its cure, and want to reach knowledge of it, then take a probe of horn or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for it with it.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a thin lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent and follows the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has very horrible openings, it is not possible for you to investigate it with a probe.
Then, inject a clyster into the opening, because the moisture by which you inject it will go through the other openings and cleanse them.
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way is possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and if the depth of the fistula is far or near, or if it is a fistula which has many openings, and attend to all this with the utmost of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes incidental to the abscess.
And when you have considered all those causes with true judgment, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider then if the fistula is near the surface or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula as was said before in the description of it, and remove that which is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and that which has grown in the opening of the flesh, or of skin and the like, and cure it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it to the extent that is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then administer cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce those into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument (iron).
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you should investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not endanger any vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with something that will cause it to grow flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and meticulously perform the scraping and cleansing of it with your utmost skill, and then restore it.
And so, if it is healed, good; but if not, then know that the corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which you have not reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but to leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to extract it, then you should extract it with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many pieces of bone, then meticulously perform the extraction of all of them, and of these do not leave anything behind with your skill.
But if some of the moisture causes you difficulty, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then apply something to the wound that will suppurate the wound, and leave it until it reaches the surrounding bone, flesh, and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, and keep the incision that you made in your operation constricted.
Moreover, if you are afraid, apply a linen cloth soaked in crushed herbs with oil, or a linen cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, because when those ligaments suppurate, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is eased.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only on the surface until that blackness and corruption is removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut out all of that, incising to the point where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh, so that you may use this as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years of age, who suffered pain in his thigh, and the internal parts were inflamed by matter within the body, until the matter reached the thigh; it was matter of an abscess with a large abscess, and there was no external cause.
And then time passed with this because of the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it; and its cure was delayed until the leg became fistulated, and many orifices formed which all discharged pus and the body's humors.
And then many physicians treated him for about two years, and they lacked not only wisdom but also skill, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter running from those orifices in great quantity; and the body of that man was quite wasted, and his complexion was jaundiced.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I examined all the orifices and found them to extend to all parts of the leg.
And then I carefully incised one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted, and it was already earthy, corrupted, and blackened; and a part of the leg was corrupted even to the marrow.
And then I sawed off what was exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I believed that in the bone there was only that corruption which I cut away and sawed off, and I had already eradicated it.
And then I applied a restorative dressing to the wound with consolidative medicine for a long time, and it did not heal.
And then I again probed and uncovered the bone a second time, on top of the first uncovering, and found continuing corruption in the bone.
And I sawed off what appeared to me to be that corruption, and then I was forced to perform the cure and restoration, and it was not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and continued to incise the bone little by little, piece by piece, and was forced to restore it, and it was not restored until I had incised about a palm's breadth of it, and I extracted that with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it healed lightly and was made whole.
And further operation and sectioning of it is not necessary except due to its fragility and its poor tolerance and fear of death, because syncope afflicted him at all hours due to excessive evacuation of humors.
And thus he healed completely, and nothing remained in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in his body was made good and its strength returned; and it was restored to its proper functions and caused him no impediment in walking or harm in any way.
But if a bone protrudes from the body already excised, then you should treat it in this manner:  You should take a ligature and tightly bind it to the extremity of that protruding bone, and order someone to extend it upwards; and place another woolen ligature, thicker than the first, and then bind that over the flesh that is beneath the bone, and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board properly under the bone, for when you do this, it is not forbidden that the saw should not cut the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done on the corrupted place little by little, for if the corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear on its surface to the senses, then it is necessary to saw it again.
And if the bone is corrupt but not protruding, with one part continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in part of it, then you uncover the flesh completely on all sides; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continued to the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason but ingenuity (or skill/cleverness).
And if the corruption is in the chest (palm) of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever way appears to you, and you must open it, and clean it according to each disposition which is possible for you, and with every skill it should be rectified for you, when no vein or nerve opposes you.
And know that the incisors and saws for incising these bones are many, according to the location of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the thickness of those, and the subtlety and size and smallness of those, and the hardness and rarity thereof; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument suitable for that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument of which you should avail yourself; when with you there is great study and long and detailed knowledge of the methods of this art, and experience with the various types of illnesses, for then you will already have for yourself that which is suitable for the instruments for every illness.
And I am providing to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will use as simples, with which you will proceed to your prohibition (i.e., treatment or procedure) which you will practice on others. Shape of saw:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of a ray (or spoke): Let the head of this ray be according to the shape of a star-shaped key head, and its points be according to the shape of the points of a [presumably, a type of] awl.
And it is only suitable that with this [tool/instrument] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the opening is very wide.
Shape of a smaller razor:
Shape of a broad razor:
Shape of another saw decently made: let it be made of the finest arc [possibly referring to a type of wood or material] and its sharpness of iron, and its handle of wood, neatly made. Its shape/form:
Shape of a razor which has a concavity:
Shape of another, subtle razor:
Shape of another razor with a curved extremity:
Shape of a small razor similar to a probe:
Shape of another, smaller incisor:
Shape of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its extremity is like a saw, and is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Shape of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of those who have perforated bones:
And its extremity is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly it is necessary that all the things we have said about razors and incisors and saws.
Concerning the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Extremities may be affected either by an intrinsic or extrinsic cause, or if you have treated that corruption with those medicines and the treatment is not effective, or if you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb to the point where the corruption has reached, so that the patient escapes death or a worse affliction which is a greater impairment of the limb.
And the sign of this affliction is that the limb turns black as if it has been burned by fire, or the blackness spreads until the decay reaches the limb so that it affects the whole body; and then treat it with an incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some venomous creature, such as a sea scorpion, viper, or mad dog, and the like.
And if the corruption or sting is in the extremity of a finger, then you incise the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it spreads to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you incise it from the root of the palm, and do not give space to the corruption so that it spreads into the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case the patient's death is certain; and to administer anything else besides this in treatment is futile.
And similarly, with the foot: when corruption affects the toe, then you incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the instep of the foot, then you incise the whole foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him but resignation, and to leave the patient to death.
And the manner of incising or cutting the limb is that you tighten a ligature on the part below where you want to incise, and tighten another ligature above the place; and let the assistant extend a ligature to the parts below, and let the assistant extend another ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, as far as is necessary, until all the flesh is uncovered; and then let it be incised or cut.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient receives a properly adjusted lesion and a hot poultice.
But if a flow of blood occurs while you are working, then carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some styptic powders to it; and then return to your treatment until it is complete.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot from a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption occurred first in his toe until it affected the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself because he saw the cure going to the limb with such vehemence that he suffered from pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and it healed.
For a long time, he experienced that same corruption in the finger of his index hand.
And then he came to me, and I attempted to repel that superfluity with what I applied to his hand in medicine, to clean his body; and the superfluity was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it began in the hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, and I did not want to do that, hoping for the repulsion of that superfluity, and moreover fearing the incision of his hand might kill him, because the patient's strength was already failing.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and it was reported to me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And I have added this narrative so that it may be helpful in cases of this illness, and that it may be a sign by which it may be recognized and according to which it may be treated.
On the treatment of sinuses and the quality of clysters with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy member and the space of the abscess is extended until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken and perforated, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty as if it were a vessel, and the skin which is over it is like a thin cloth, and it has not reached putrefaction, and does not impinge on the bone, nerve or ligament, it is called a sinus, and it is not called a fistula.
However, if the space is extended so that the corruption affects any member, then it is called a fistula and not a sinus.
And its treatment is to incise that skin completely as it is rolled up, especially when it is thinned and made like cloth, and make sure that it does not adhere to the place due to its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin adheres and that the corruption has not reached the underlying layers, and there is a widening in the skin, then you treat that with a clyster.
And it is that you consider the sinus, and then if it is large, and the arm which is affected has a fetid odor, then you should clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine which is of oil and sharp wine and zinc, taking equal parts, and they are mixed in a vessel, and they are cooked over the fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
And then you take what is necessary of it and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with this, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine in it for the quantity of two hours.
And then extract it with suction; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul smell is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with lye water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is that you take the ashes of vine wood, and put water over them; and then filter this and clysterize with it until you are satisfied that the sinus is then clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine nor the lye water, then clysterize it with water and honey with finely ground zinc mixed in, and clysterize it with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, and especially when the wine has a surplus of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and you are satisfied that the sinus is now clean, then clysterize it with something that causes the flesh to grow there.
And it is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you clysterize it with some other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the opening of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster cannula cannot be inserted, then you should widen it little by little with an iron instrument, and place a tent wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside until it is widened.
And similarly, if the opening is wide, then you should approximate its lips with sutures and leave it a size such that the clyster can enter without addition.
And if the opening from which the pus flows is located higher up, then drain it at the lowest point so that the pus flows downwards, because when the pus is retained in the depth of the sinus, flesh will not grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus into the lowest surrounding bone as you wish, then ensure you prepare the limb with a preparation by which the pus flows slightly as is expedient to you, and that no pus is retained there.
But the one over the opening of the sinus, change that every hour so that whatever pus is collected there comes out. And so that you know if the pus flowing from it is much or little, or is digested, or is undigested.
And with this, consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter thrown over the opening of the sinus is already adhering, or is about to adhere, then remove it on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, then change the cloth for another and renew the ointment.
But if near the sinus there is a subtle poison, then do not despair of its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and there are those in whom the opposite is true.
And if undigested pus has come from the sinus for many days, then know that the sinus will not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying of the medicines, and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their virtue, they are dry like diafinicon ointment, when superfluity of addition of zegi is adjusted in it.
And the best remedy with which it is cured, is that you take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and let old wine be poured over it equal in its substance, and mix that with it, and use that.
And it resembles that action, when there is no pus, diafinicon ointment, honey cooked until it thickens, and use that; or that you take myrrh, aloes, and incense, and crush everything and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire, and then spread this on a cloth and bind it over the sinus; and spread that with the honey which you have cooked until it is thickened, and powder it on a cloth and bind it.
And sometimes aristolochia longa and roots of lily of the valley (and it is lily of the valley) and flour of barley and centaury are administered with it, and use those simples or compounded, crush those and sieve them and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use that.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the depth of it, and it already affects the bones or other hard parts or ligaments; then you treat it with fistular treatment, as said above.
Of the treatment of paronychia and worn nails and added finger incision and section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of the finger or toe of the hand or foot, and quickly spreads to the other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less valued, or is inflamed from a hot abscess, or is corrupt, and pus forms until it corrodes the root of the nail, and quickly corrupts the whole of it, and quickly its corruption reaches the bone until there is a foul odor from it, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its color becomes dark.
And therefore when you have this with what we have said in the division and your treatment does not succeed, then it is necessary that you incise with iron all the superfluity that remains of the nail and then cauterize the wound, for a hot cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, now empty, compress the flesh at the edges inside, and begin to prick and injure it, then it is necessary that you place a thin thread under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up and incise that flesh easily, and place on what remains of the flesh corrosive burning medicines until it is all removed; and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already affected the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and remove it, for no healing time is possible while the bone is corrupt.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption going into the finger, then you incise it at one of the joints as its removal dictates, and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers percussion or abrasion, and there is vehement pain in it, then it is necessary that you first bleed the patient, and then cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse section from above downwards, and be careful that the section does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause the patient vehement pain, and it will be the cause of the generation of superfluous flesh in that place; and then treat that place with what alleviates pain.
But a finger, which is born in the hands of some men, is quickly all fleshy, and quickly has bones, or quickly has nails.
And some of them are born at the root of the joint, or their birth is at some joints of the fingers. But that which is born at some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born at the joints is quickly painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the section is easy, and it is that you incise that one below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the knuckles, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their knuckles, whether by the birth of a man born thus, or by the consolidation of a wound or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as needed.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and appropriate to the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of vices, they are various.
Vices are various, and they are twisted, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and they occur most frequently in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and burden-bearers.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
But the treatment of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are incised and that black blood is drawn out, and the other method is that the vein is elevated and entirely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner:  first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, foul blood of the leg is resolved. Then bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh down to below the knee with a bandage. Then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision. Then, with your hand, press the black blood from the lower part of the leg upwards and from above downwards, until the desired quantity of blood is expelled and the amount you judge sufficient is removed, which will take away the strength of the ailment.
Then bind it up, and instruct the patient to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But their elevation is according to this method: you who shave the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, and then place it in a bath and bathe the leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are swollen; or, if a bath is not available, have the limb heated by vigorous exercise.
Then incise the vein along its length, either behind the knee, or at its lowest point below the heel.
Then open the vein with an incision and scrape the vein on all sides until it is sensitive, and it is from its appearance that you will see that redness turning towards blackness.
And then, when you evacuate [blood] from the vein, you will see that which is white like a string.
Then you place a leech below it until it is elevated and is drawn from the vein, and suspend it with a gold or silver hook.
Then make another incision near that incision three fingers' breadth away, and scrape the vein from the part above the vein until it appears.
Then elevate it and incise it at the back of the heel, and then extract it and elevate it until it comes out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is most superior or highest of all the incisions, until it is all extracted; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you in being extracted and elevated, then introduce a double-pointed, strong needle and tie it and extract it, or introduce a leech below it and move your hand in every direction until it is drawn out. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to elevate it and harm has come upon the patient through that injury.
And when it is all expelled, then place on the wound site wool soaked in rose wine and un-rose-flavored olive oil, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the intestine is constricted, having a tortuosity to which there is a twisting in the parts, and is not according to the straightness as we have said, then it is necessary that you incise it in every part of its tortuosity and in the places of its twisting, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it completely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
The form of the incision with which the intestine is cut:
It is not sharpened like hooks, nor is it of sharp extremity so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of a thick, flexible nature, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein through its thinness;  it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of a vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little moisture, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, maggots, and worms are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is that vehement inflammation occurs in the leg; and the area is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the site of that blister, which resembles a plant root.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm to two drachms, and tie it and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as you see something emerge from it externally, wrap that in lead and tie it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you incise a part of it and wrap up the remainder; and do not incise the root until it has emerged, for if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh and causes an abscess and putrefaction in the area and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is completely expelled and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein, in some men, a growth emerges that is five palms and fingers in length, and it has even reached me that one emerged that was twenty palms long.
And if it is incised at the time of its treatment, then introduce a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long channel into the body, until everything that is in the matter is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the area for some days with medicines; and then treat it with the cure for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices come to it, and a branch emerges from each orifice.
And therefore cure it in the way we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision of worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine illness.
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because many times it happens to cows, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and goes throughout the body, rising and falling, and is shown by the feeling of its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms and snakes and earthworms and ascarids are produced in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it goes into the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then very quickly it enters and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is not done except according to its movement and appearance to the touch, and then it is necessary that you tightly bind that which is above it and that which is below it with strong ligature and constriction, and then dry it above and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you place a cautery with fire on the place until it dies, and the greatest cause that is feared is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong constriction, and then dry above it, and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of their body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard against foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision (or cutting) for the illness nafir.
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in some members, and then is moved from member to member.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the superficial vein of the arm, and after it had remained for an hour, I saw that swelling move like a worm climbing upwards, but more lightly than a worm, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and remained there for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then I realised that it was moving throughout her body, as I had seen; and I was very surprised by its change of place and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find that pain is transferred from limb to limb. But I did not see it with my own eyes in the same way as in this woman.
And I do not think this is so, except that it is because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this case that wind-like sensation appeared to be transferred.
And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this backward cure in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on that place and slightly dry it  until that constricted wind is expelled, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then you treat it with chest percussion and with things that expel winds, and drive them out with foul-smelling pills and pills of Serapion and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they land, for their diversity is such that there are those with large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and those that have three angles, and those that have barbs; and those that have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, it is when an arrow falls into it, and pierces the bone, and comes out of the skull which is over the brain, for it causes sudden vehement pain, and scotoma (blurred vision), and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile, and speech is quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and a white humidity resembling pus comes from the wound, and the eyes seem watery like the flesh.
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside [the body].
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, is that it is near the left breast, and one feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not in something empty; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death follows without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are thus: the expulsion of frothy blood from the wound, and the vessels which are near the neck are inflamed, and the color of the patient is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the intake of cool air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm which is in the chest, the pain then is near the small ribs, and the breath is drawn with great and vehement pain and with sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are paralyzed.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes from the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is fixed there, there will be some discharge of pus from the wound, or the flesh, or intestine which is ruptured, and there is no hope for its cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine issues forth, and something proceeds from it to the outside parts, and very quickly pain overcomes the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle, and the hip, and the leg and similar members, are saved according to the greater dispositions when the arrow does not find a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may thereby understand your treatment.
Which is the reason why, in a man, an arrow fell into the lacrimal duct of his eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it from him on the other side, below the lobe of his ear, and he is healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell into him in the lobe of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and I found only a small point with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with an iron head in which there were no barbs.
And the Jew is healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and this is one which has barbs; and then I incised over it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I worked delicately with it, and I extracted it, and the Christian is healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and then, after thirty days had passed and no change had occurred in his condition, I incised over the arrow and pulled it out, and he is healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw another man in whom an arrow fell into his back, and the wound consolidated on him, and after about seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound is healed within her, and nothing is changed in her condition, and the woman finds no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound is healed and the arrow broken, finding here little pain, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the man of the king's princes that had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already declined a little to the right side, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure about three days after the arrow's impact.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I investigated it with a thin probe, and I did not feel it; but he felt a prickling under his right ear, and then I suspected that that prickling was from the tip of the arrow.
And I plastered the area with a plaster which has attractive and digestive virtue, trusting that the area would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would appear to me, so that I could cut into it.
And no significant incident occurred in the area indicating that the arrow had reached that place; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no incident occurred; and the wound was meanwhile consolidated, and the patient rested from its extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and reported this to me.
And then I applied a sharp corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I tested it, and I found the thin tip of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I applied to the opening of the wound that sharp medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared visibly to me, and I spent time with this for a period of about four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged, and it was possible for me to insert forceps into it, and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to subtly and skillfully work on it with ingenious methods, until I managed one day with ingenious instruments to grasp it with suitably made forceps, as the form of these will appear at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored that wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, but I restored it and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed completely, and he suffered no ill effects.
And I recount to you the quality of the extraction of certain arrows so that you may consider this a rule and explanation of what I have not said, for the parts of this art and its definitions are not comprehended in narration, nor do books contain them.
And skilled artisans compare the small with the large; and what is present with what is absent; and find new operations and new instruments due to the consideration of unusual situations in the art when they occur.
Therefore I say that arrows are not removed from the limbs into which they are fixed except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they enter; or by counter-traction from the opposite side.
And that which is removed from the place where it entered, is an arrow situated in fleshy tissue, and is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield to removal at the time of discovery, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it softens, and its removal and extraction are eased.
And similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to removal, then leave it for some days and repeatedly attempt its removal with traction and movement each day, and it will eventually be extracted.
And if it still does not yield to removal after some days, then you must perforate the bone around the arrow on all sides with a fine drill until the space around the arrow is widened, and then extract it.
But if the arrow is hidden within the body and is beyond feeling, then you should search for it with a probe, and if you feel it, then draw it out with instruments suitable for its extraction.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the probe, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then you should incise the wound until it is widened and it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if it is held by barbs, then you should carefully free the flesh in which it is embedded by every means you can; and work on this, if you cannot otherwise remove the flesh by breaking off the barbs and twisting them until they yield.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use twisting motions of your hand and forceps on all sides until it yields; and proceed with the utmost delicacy so that the arrow is not broken and that its extraction is not made difficult for you.
And if you cannot manage it at that time, then leave it for a few days until the parts surrounding it soften, and then attempt it again, for it will then be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then administer the treatment described in the appropriate chapter.
And be careful not to cut any veins, nerves, or tendons, and use every possible means to extract the arrow; and do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And so that you may contract the wound so that the patient is positioned according to the location of the arrow's entry, because that is more beneficial. But if this is not possible for you, then administer what you can according to the circumstances.
But if arrows are protruding from the opposite side, or if any part of the arrow projects outside the body, or if the tip of the arrow is curved, feeling the part above the aforementioned area and seeing it prominent; then you should cut above it; and the incision should be according to the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will be easily removed in this manner.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you twist the blade in the opposite direction until the arrow breaks in the bone, and widen the wound itself, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still inside, then you push it all the way through.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to administer impulsion, then you introduce, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity of it enters the base of the arrow and then push it through.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then you push it through with a strong instrument entering it, because the arrowhead is eased by it.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary that you remove all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow falls into the foot, or into the belly, or into the bladder, or into the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let the ends of them be like the beak of a bird, which are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the tightness of it.
like a ray, so that the entry of it into the concave arrow is eased and it is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called *alhasisain*; two veins that are in the two apparent temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called *aspicientz*; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and two *guidegi* that are at the neck; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins that are called *algelic* —; and there are two veins that are under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of these, one is the cephalic, and it is on the outer side of the arm; and the people call it "the vein of the head", and it is a superficial vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people call that one "vein of the whole body", and the basilic is the vein which is situated on the inner side of the arm, and is called "citillar", and the common people call that one "vein of the belly"; and the median vein of the arm, and it is situated above the elbow, and it is that in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and the salvatella, and it is the vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is that which is below the bend of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the outer side; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The opening of the veins that are near the ears is for chronic catarrhs and migraines, and headaches, and old, bad ulcers of the head.
And the manner of bleeding those veins is as I have recounted to you:  it is that the head of the patient should be raised, and the head of the patient should be rubbed at the occiput in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then the patient should constrict his neck with a band until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed places of the head; and feel them with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then bleed there with a lancet.
Then you take the lancet knife, and it is that which is sharp, and then you insert that below the vein into the skin until the blood comes to the opening. Then raise your hand with the vein and the skin to the upper parts and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two fingers placed together, or thereabouts; and let blood flow out as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already and previously in the beginning of the book [I have described] the incision of these and their cauterization.
But of the two arterial veins that are at the temples, the benefit of phlebotomy is for chronic and severe migraine, and persistent ophthalmia, and a flow of acute superfluities effused into the eyes.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is as I recounted to you: constrain the patient's neck very much until the two veins appear to the senses by manifest appearance and their pulse is demonstrated beneath your finger; and then you mark with a probe.
Then you raise the skin above the vein at the upper parts with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy lancet below, and raise the vein upwards; and incise it just as you did in the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your necessity.
And then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it above with strong constriction, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the remembrance of them, and of their incision, and the drawing [of blood] has been preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in old diseases of the face, and for migraine, rigor, and fetid ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I recounted to you; that is, that the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a fossor, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the fossor upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or other such thing in the manner thereof, and let the blood flow according to the quantity which you desire; and then unbind the perforation of the patient and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of acute extremity as are the other phlebotomies, rather it should be of a blunt extremity, and phlebotomize it across, for the bone is near and would easily break there if the phlebotomy were fine/sharp.
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the lacrimal ducts of the two eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for redness and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient should tighten his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made across rather than lengthwise, with a small phlebotomy instrument, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy instrument is sharp, its point will very easily be broken.
And then make the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton there, and bind it for one night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and vehement headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and redness that occurs in the face, and especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient should tighten his neck, and then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin phlebotomy instrument and insert it into the middle of the bridge of the nose in a straight line, because the vein is not apparent to the touch there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
Carefully move your hand with the phlebotomy instrument little by little and make the blood flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, for it is lightly restored (or healed).
But the application of phlebotomy to the two temples is beneficial for the constriction of the throat, and for the beginning of leprosy, and for many diseases, and impetigo, and bad, corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy in these (temples) is that the patient should hold each temple with a bandage; and the surgeon should stand over the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a stool.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide phlebotomy instrument little by little; and then extract blood according to a moderate quantity or according to what necessity demands; and then do likewise with the other vein.
And then untie the bandage and bind the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the alveolar veins is good for small abscesses and pustules of the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of those (veins) is that you make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck with a bandage, and then you pull back their lips and look for two veins, of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the identification of each is by the blackness of each of the two, and this is more so because in the area of these there are small black veins; and then incise each with an incisive incision.
But if you are in doubt, and you do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger of those veins, and the most apparent of them.
And do the same for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit is in the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for throat inflammations, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing these is that you hold the patient between your hands before the sun, and lift his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side you will see a vein and on the other side a vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each; and be careful not to put your hand too deeply when phlebotomizing these, because under these are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those which are present in all men, and their phlebotomy is done in two ways: either they are opened with a lancet or an olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument of subtle sharpness; or they are incised with a cupped phlebotomy instrument, and this is called scarification, and this is its form:
Let its width be like this, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy is of lesser width and of a more subtle extremity, and is suitable for phlebotomy of subtle veins which contain thin, clear blood.
But the usefulness of phlebotomy of the basilica vein, which is one of three veins: because it extracts blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and from that which affects the feet and the abdomen.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he carefully guards against this and be very cautious, for beneath it is an artery, and if he errs and is imprecise in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will sever that artery and cause a flow of blood; therefore, it is necessary that he not phlebotomize this with a sharp phlebotomy tool before it is cut with a lancet.
And if the basilica vein does not appear in manifest view, then it is necessary that you leave it and that you move to another, or that you seek some branch of it; or that you phlebotomize in its place at the end of the arm, for that is manifest; and cut it with a lancet-phlebotomy tool as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before the constriction of the arm, you must touch the area until you recognize the location of the pulse, and then mark it with a pen; and then bind the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision with a lancet-phlebotomy tool, as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall within the space of the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place you have marked with a pen, then that swelling is a swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing from the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery's blood; and then you observe and place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the blood is severed, for many times it is severed, then you tighten the arm and leave it.
And guard the patient from his movement, and let there be an abundance of caution towards him and do not anger him for some days until he is healed.
But if the blood is not severed, and you see that you do not have a suitable medicine for this, then you incise the artery, if it seems right to you; because its extremity is contracted, and the blood is severed; or that you take bark of a fig tree, and grind it, and take one half and bind it tightly to the place of the vein with a descending ligature and with powders until the next day.
And then if the blood is severed, it is good; and if not, then cure it with that which has been previously mentioned in the recollection of the place of the powders that sever the flow of blood.
And the severing of his blood is difficult in many conditions because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But from the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful, which extracts blood from the superior part of the head and from the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of a branch of the basilica and a branch of the cephalic, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist to be very careful in his phlebotomy, for below it is a nerve; and then if he errs in the puncture of the phlebotomy and finds the nerve, stupor will befall him, and its healing is difficult, and he is not healed at all very quickly. And this nerve often appears to the senses; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and is not shown, then it behooves you to hold the phlebotomy instrument with which you perform phlebotomy with a careful incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should incise the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and benefits diseases of the eyes.
And it is fitting in this case, if you wish to make the phlebotomy puncture with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped phlebotomy instrument; for it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither artery nor nerve beneath it.
However, a small abscess forms quickly in some men when it is not phlebotomized on the first puncture, but that abscess does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and the prevention of illnesses, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be done at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtime, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or on the first day after three hours have passed.
But phlebotomy, which is administered, is most appropriate and necessary, whether by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child should not be phlebotomized until he is fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month until the seventh, and old women who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wishes to be phlebotomized in any manner whatsoever, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a cleansing enema, if he has much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities into the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are putrid, and that they not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with nausea, fever, or diarrhea be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or weakness until this is improved in them, nor those suffering from dropsy; furthermore, phlebotomy should be avoided in cases of colic, vomiting, abdominal pain, excessive sexual activity, hard work, and exercise, fasting, or wakefulness, and any cause that weakens the vital force, whether bodily or spiritual.
And consider carefully the thinning of humors beforehand if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if that is possible for him.
And then enter a bath if no cause forbids it, or be exercised by some activity so that the blood is thinned.
And perform the phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's foot is protected that day from all harmful accidents, both emotional, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and physical, such as excessive work and exertion, sexual activity, and similar things.
And at his bedside, let there be present things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and perfumes, and with balms and similar things, according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, the phlebotomist should extend the patient's arm, and rub it with his hand two or three times; and then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is not equal, or is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the blood from flowing properly.
Then, near the constriction, the one who is to be phlebotomized should rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then the phlebotomist should anoint his fleam (lancet) with a little old oil; and then place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, just below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein shifts slightly, and the pulsation ceases, because the veins that are found like a fleeing cord should be avoided for phlebotomy; those that are full of wind and contract when you place the fleam on them are to be avoided by the phlebotomist; the fleam should not open the vein, and if it opens one, that vein is tight.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive in all these matters.
Then apply the fleam; but if the vein is opened on the first try, that is good; if not, repeat the process a little lower or higher, quickly, if the area is not infected.
And if the area is infected, or the patient is frightened, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it would quickly draw a hot abscess, nor should the patient enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the incision is small and the blood flows slowly, and you fear that you will not obtain the desired quantity of blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in that opening, straightening and widening the incision slightly, and do this quickly before the area becomes infected, for in many men the area becomes infected from a small incision.
But if you see that it is already infected, then do not repeat the procedure there, for there is no reason to do so; and place on it some olive oil, for it relieves the body of blood. And olive oil is better in this instance than other oils.
Similarly, administer olive oil in all phlebotomies by which you phlebotomize the veins to prevent blood clots, and use theriac, alexipharmic, and sage when one of these is applied to the site, for the blood is thinned and the clot is dissolved when it is thick.
And if a large abscess is formed at the site of the phlebotomy—for this happens many times, and especially in someone who has only been bled once or where the incision in the vein was small—then wait, and apply a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water, and compress it for an hour, for this will resolve it.
And it is necessary to do this near the exit of the blood from that vein, by completing it or another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains at the site for a few days, do not worry about it; and if you wish, apply something made from dissolved aloe and myrrh, or something made from the juice of mint or calamint, or something similar.
And abscesses and swellings often occur after phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And then place your hand on it, and if you then find softness under your compression on it, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then be careful that you apply something of what we have said, because blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has styptic properties, so that the area is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract blood from every man according to the quantity of his strength and according to the color prevailing over the blood as it appears.
Because if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly if it is sharp (or thin), until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs bloodletting at once, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomy be wide.
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary that you extract [blood] in small amounts, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy is that the incision be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safer from blood flow and nerve injury, and is more praiseworthy and safer than phlebotomy according to latitude and longitude (i.e., a long, thin incision).
And to one accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, you should treat this before phlebotomy with a little bread infused in pomegranate wine or warmed simple oxymel; and extract the blood in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then before phlebotomy take bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in honey syrup aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in an aromatic and very fragrant syrup.
And if syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and this is caused by the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink water of flesh (broth) and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with rue, and let his feet be warmed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter on syncope by evacuation.
And whoever wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him for whom phlebotomy is for the purpose of evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to the amount of strength on consecutive days.
But whoever wants to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do this after seven or nine hours from the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it declines (i.e., to counter an imbalance), it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and it is sharp and causes fever, it is necessary that blood be drawn from it at once, and a great quantity be drawn from it, and the opening be enlarged until syncope occurs, provided that you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse above the heart, so that death does not occur instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, even if the opening of the vein is closed and the exit of the blood is made difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and force it to be extended slightly, for this is very bad.
Having let it be until it is bled a second time; or remove that with the sharpness of the phlebotomy instrument which is coagulated blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac alfarach, or a leech, and compress it with light compression until the blood has come out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is settled.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed him in that place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in warm water until the lancet reddens and the vein appears clearly.
Then it should be tightened over that with a bandage with moderate constriction; and then phlebotomize according to the small transversal, neither laterally nor lengthwise.
And let the opening be wide, and perform your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize that, a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is inhibited, then you again put the hand in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your need.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from putting the hand repeatedly in warm water, and the same is true if the blood is placed in warm water in winter time.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, because under it there is no pulsating vein, nor nerve.
And phlebotomy of the little vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you tighten the hand with a ligature or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and is well demonstrated to the sight; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you incise it completely, that will not harm in any way.
And take care not to injure your hand with the phlebotomy, because under it are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
Then return the hand to the warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and the flow is prohibited.
And when the blood is extracted according to the necessary quantity, then you place oil and salt on the vein, so that it is not quickly consolidated; and similarly it is necessary that you do this in every narrow branch.
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And do similarly in his phlebotomy as you have done in the other.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for the retention of menstrual blood, and for the illnesses of old sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs, and for similar illnesses.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient puts his foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins appear well; and bind above the joint of the foot with a strap; and the place of the vein is apparent near the said thumb, and from that one, many branches are ramified on the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg near the heel, for it is better and healthier.
And if you phlebotomize that one on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy with the tool you use for phlebotomy across them, as if you were going to cut it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the outflow of blood is prohibited; then you immerse his foot in warm water and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the location is safe; and do not fear harming him, but take care to avoid the nerves as we have said.
And similarly, do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
And of the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, below the ankle bone of the outer part.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient enter a bath, and quickly and tightly bind his thigh from the side of the hip up above the ankle with a long, thin bandage, for it will not appear otherwise.
And then, when it appears, then you phlebotomize that according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse; and it is better; or incise it by incision or cut it by section, for its location is safe.
And it is very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize some branch of it, and that is the one that appears on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the quantity of blood you wish flow.
And then loosen the binding and place cotton over the place of the phlebotomy and bind the place tightly, for it heals easily.
Of cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping vessels are of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping which is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And for cupping vessels that are administered with scarification and bloodletting, there are fourteen places on the body, of which one where cupping vessels are placed is at the nape of the neck, which is the back part of the head; and the middle place of the two sides of the neck together; and cupping vessels of the chin below the jaw below the mouth; and cupping vessels of the two shoulder blades; and cupping vessels of the loins, and that is above the end of the buttocks; and cupping vessels of the two flanks, and they are of the two sides; and cupping vessels of the two hips; and cupping vessels of the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the strength through them, as is the case with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping because of illness or a continuing condition, let it be administered at any time at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it and at any time whatsoever.
Therefore, when you see any of those conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we command that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied, it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is sunken in the eyes; but this should be done after the evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advisable to use it on someone of cold complexion, or in whom there is catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a one.
And therefore, it is not advisable to use it on the elderly, and on those whose heads suffer from cold ailments.
But to the one on whom this is continuously applied, forgetfulness is caused; and therefore you should instruct the cupper to place his hand a little below the cupping glass, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping with alkehel (likely referring to a specific substance or technique) is in the place of phlebotomy of the dark vein and the basilic vein: and therefore it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the breath, and the splitting of the instrument of breath (possibly referring to the lungs or trachea), and cough, and repletion (likely referring to excess fluids or congestion).
And it is necessary that the alkehel cupping glass be slightly elevated, for if it is placed too low, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping with alhagdahan (likely another specific substance or technique) benefits accidental pains in the head, and ophthalmia (eye inflammation), and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And you should instruct the cupper not to press his hand with scarification, lest he cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar oral diseases, and it is in place of phlebotomy of the  alicheric (likely a specific vein near the lips), which is in the two lips.
But cupping that is done on the two shoulder blades benefits caphatan (likely a specific condition), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two inner parts of the ankles benefits similarly to phlebotomy of three veins, that is, of the basilic, median cubital (fusca - possibly a variant or less precise term for it), and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the drawing reaches the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed too much with scarification, because the place is devoid of flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass with which one cups on the hips, and it benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that it should be a large cupping glass, and that it should be of brass, because the place requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses are quickly broken and should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs diminishes pain by manifest depletion, because it draws blood from the whole body, and benefits old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and benefits dropsy and swelling; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two ankles.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause syncope in many men.
And of the ankle cuppings, the benefit is similar to the benefit of the leg cuppings.
And the quality of the application of cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw it by tempered suction, and do not prolong the application of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors may come to the place by equal admixture. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the blood's redness appear.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and consider the disposition of the bodies.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to enlarge the scarification and make it somewhat deeper, and temper the suction with ease.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and its humidity. But in the second [scarification], to the scrutiny acquired by the extraction of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that it achieves the end.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the term scarification in which there is only the depth of the [finger]nail.
And if the one whose nail is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places for the cupping glasses be anointed with lenitive, aperitive, and resolvent ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, or violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then the oil should be amaranth oil, or balm mint oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be prohibited, and for such a one the places for cupping should be washed before cupping with rose water, or with cold water of solanum (nightshade), or with poppy water, or with  borage water, and similar ones.
And the one whose blood is of much humidity, wash his cupping sites with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for one whose superfluities are thick, wash the cupping sites with old wine, or with water of sanc (perhaps a type of herb, possibly savory or majoram), which is marjoram, or a decoction of anise, or of chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before a bath; rather, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and he should sleep after the cupping.
What is it that the person to be cupped or bled ought to be regulated [before cupping]?  or  What must be done to prepare the patient for cupping or bloodletting?
It is necessary to consider at the beginning:  if the person to be cupped or bled is choleric and has sharp blood and inflammation, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, endive in sour wine and lettuce, and succory, and julep, and similar things.
And give him foods such as poultry, and the meat of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with sour things, and similar things.
And for one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of succory seeds, and sumac, and very fragrant wine, milder between old and new; and that he be advised to use little drink and food, and give him foods such as poultry, hempseed, peas, small birds, and doves.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and bloodletting his drink be greater than his food.
And it is necessary that at certain hours some men be given theriac alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or theriac before cupping or before bloodletting or nearby, so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is thinned; and they should not take those things that warm.
But cupping without scarification should be applied over the liver, and over the spleen and gout, and over the navel, in the areas of the knees, and the groin, because these members do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not desired for those [members] except the attraction of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of nasal bleeding; and we use this so that cold, invisible windiness in the member is dissolved, just as we place it on the belly and navel; for this rarefies the member and warms it and reduces the pain because it resolves windiness.
And it is placed on the throat when inflammation or swelling occurs there, for by virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the inflammation and removes the swelling from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of windiness enclosed in them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, with warm water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been boiled.
Method of administering a cupping glass with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and let the length of the horn be half a palm; and let it be at the side of it, in the place that is in the circumference, half of it, the hole being small enough for a needle to enter it.
Let it be made of bronze, copper, or citrus, with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb because of its placement on it.
And let there be a transverse bar of bronze or iron in the middle of it, on which a candle is placed with the fire.
And now let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for young people and those with large bodies.
And the method of placing this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the wick with a decently sized wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the lower part so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the hole we have mentioned, until when we have the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and let the vapor escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be removed.
And then ignite the wick according to its manner, and repeat this if you need to.
But in cupping, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and is not administered unless it is filled with water, and is placed on the limb alone.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a greater quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leeches are not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs in which the placement of cupping glasses is not possible, because of their small size, such as the finger and gum and similar; or to a member devoid of flesh, such as the finger and nose and similar.
And the quality of using those:  If you have found leeches that are in clean fresh waters of a spring.
And then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and so that no matter remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then let them be placed upon it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to suck the area with a cupping glass, it is afterwards more beneficial.
And if not, then wash the area with wine vinegar and then with warm water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged near the attachment of the leeches, and it is oozing, then you dip a cloth in cold water and place that over it until the oozing is stopped.
And if the blood is profuse, then sprinkle on it crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and things similar to them of styptic qualities, until the bleeding is stopped; or let halves of roasted beans be placed on the area, and let them remain until the beans stick to the place, and the bleeding is stopped.
And it is necessary, if needed, to reapply leeches, when it is possible to change those.
And if the leeches are prevented from attaching, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood comes out; and then let them be applied, because when they sense any blood they immediately attach.
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them a little crushed aloes, or salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
Oh, son, know that foolish and vulgar physicians boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients or read a single letter of them.
And for this reason, this manner of knowledge is kept private in our land; and I have never forgotten this in any way; and I have not acquired this except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study of their understanding, until I extracted their knowledge.
And then I added experiment and study throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all that my knowledge contains and on which my experience is based; since I have shortened it for you and freed it from lengthy occupation; and I have shortened it for the sake of brevity; and I have shown it for the sake of clarity; and I have presented many forms of the instruments that are used in it, as is done by way of explanation, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter one.
Summaries and collections of bone fractures, of those things which are necessary to know beforehand, before we begin the discussion of broken limbs and their various types. Therefore, I will say in the prologue of this chapter the summaries of the discourse; and the chapters to the understanding of which, in the beginning, the craftsman is compelled to stand firm on the truth of them; that is, you and those who are ready to know or learn this noble art, as well as others of you.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall happens to someone, then you should initially attend to it with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, unless some cause prohibits it, such as weakness of constitution, or if the person who has suffered this is an infant, or an elderly person in a weakened state, or if the time is one of intense heat or intense cold.
And moreover, let him be content with a light diet of herbs and the flesh of birds and rabbits; and we prohibit rich meats and overfilling oneself with food and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are sure of a benign abscess, and if you do not fear effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to his former regimen, to which he is accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the patient be fed nourishing foods, foods that are very substantial and heavy, and in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat boiled in water, and rice, and heads [of grain?], and peas, and cow's stomachs, and eggs, and fresh fish, and thick wine and similar things. With this regimen, the consolidation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in their first youth and in the elderly, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
However, nature fits and brings together to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until they are together conjoined and bound together, until they come to the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until nothing prevents it from its work.
And for this reason, it is necessary that you provide the patient with foods in which there is weight, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another.
And I come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter distinct from the others.
Much diversity of fracture in itself. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arcuate fracture, besides those that happen in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the shaft and splinters and additions proceeding and not proceeding, just as is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type belongs its own proper treatment or torment in its restoration, as recollection of it will be recounted distinctly in its own place.
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this is a bone fracture known: its crookedness, and the eminence and appearance of it to the touch, and that of it when we compress it with the hand.
And therefore when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is anything felt by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Perhaps there is a crookedness or small fissure; then you should not move it with your hand and with complete compression; rather, apply to it the medicines of which mention will be made in their appropriate place; and it should also be tightly bound with a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is bent but not split in two, or other such accident has not befallen it, as if the whole part is removed from its comparison, then you should begin at once to rectify it before an abscess happens to it by chance.
And if a hot abscess happens to it, then leave it for a few days until the abscess ceases; and then treat it according to whatever method you can, gently and skillfully.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a more serious injury has occurred.
And then bind it as the remedy will indicate.
But if the bone is injured, then extension of that broken member from two parts is necessary, if it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the member is small; or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand.
And your position should be such that you place the injured limb according to its natural shape, while the broken parts of the limb are extended; then you must force those parts back into their places skillfully and in whatever way you can.
And be careful, according to your strength, that you do not cause pain or injury to the patient through your operation; and endeavor to the best of your ability to apply one bone to its fellow, according to their best possible alignment.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch it with your hand, and if you see anything amiss, correct it and align it to the extent of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who often cause hot abscesses through their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen through their operations many times.
And the nature of the binding of the quieted limb is that which I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their largeness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the forearm and similar to those, then the wrapping should be of very fine soft cloth.
But for those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, the wrapping should be broad and firm, because a broad bandage connects the large limb and binds it on all sides with even pressure, so that no blemish enters it.
Then begin, then your equalization evacuation, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of the fracture with three or four wrappings according to what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the highest part of the fracture site, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you bound the fracture site. And then extend yourself with the wrapping of the fracture site a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you take a large part of the site.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken area with a bandage, and then come with the bandages to the lowest part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the tightening of the bandage and in the softening of it as we have said in the first bandage above.
And then place between the layers of the bandage linen or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, do not place anything there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then bind over these bandages well-made splints immediately, if there is no inflammation or hot abscess in the area, and then place over it that which dries the abscess and reduces the inflammation; and leave that for some days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be of half a reed of smooth, well-shaped wood; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint that is placed over the fracture be a little thicker and smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to how it fits the limb in size and smallness; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with string properly as we have said of tightening, and it is so that your tightening is according to the place of the fracture more, and the further it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen by the operation of some fools placing their threads of twisted rope, and it is a great error, when the tightening loses equality.
And similarly, very fine threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve with those what you want by tightening, and it is not necessary that between splint and splint there should be less than a finger's width.
And if the patient is hurt by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place under those some carded flax or wool until it does not cause him harm.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the skin, and I will return to this in the following chapter according to its particularities.
And know that not every broken limb is bound with splints on the first day; the reason is that, when the limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints on it until about five or seven days, or more, according to your certainty of avoiding a hot abscess.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients made restorations, which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Method of a common plaster, a bruised remedy for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many constitutions and especially for women and children, because it is something that neither heat nor cold overcomes: and it is that you take powdered moly, and this is the marrow of the flour that hangs from the movement of the mill on the walls of the mill.
And make it thus as it is, except that you sieve it with egg white, and make the confection of it neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of ladanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and meligrane, which is the root of wild pomegranate, of each one dram; of myrrh and aloe, five drams; of aloes, twenty drams; all should be crushed and sifted and mixed with aloe water or with egg white if the patient's constitution is hot; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores lightly broken bones, and benefits many men.
Another method of plaster which benefits fractures and sprains: take of meligrane and white mallow root, ten drams; of myrrh and of aloe, five drams; of acacia, six drams; of Armenian bole, twenty drams.
All should be crushed in a mortar with much grinding, and be sifted, and be mixed with water or with egg white and be administered.
Method of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: let dirty wool be taken and be submerged in sour wine and boiled oil and be placed on the area.
But in this plaster there is no restorative virtue, it only draws out hot abscesses and expels pain.
Another method of plaster that restores a broken bone: take leaves of the fig tree and leaves of wild poppy; crush everything and make a plaster from them.
Method of a brief plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remainder of an abscess: take roots of mallow, of chamomile, and violet flowers, of pea flour, of all an equal part; let all be crushed and be mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix that with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method of a stronger plaster in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb: take roots of mallow and linseed, and of pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all in equal parts; let all be crushed and be mixed with willow water or with sweet water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
But Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be of medium consistency between thick and thin.
But in Gaul it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the things which cause desiccation with little heat are thus, like myrrh, incense, and similar to those things that we have mentioned.
Method of a plaster that benefits lesions and pain: take millet, wax, shaved human hair or bird down, and mallow, and salt, in equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain and when it should be loosened is this: consider if no pain or itching has occurred, and the bone is not broken or dislocated; then you do not loosen it for many days. And if vehement pain, itching, or inflammation occurs at the location, then immediately loosen or untie it at that time, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a damp sea sponge, and immerse it in lukewarm water, and with this wash the area until that itching ceases and the pain is calmed; and then let the limb rest for an hour; and then place on it dirty wool soaked in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are sure of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb has subsided, and its pain is lessened.
And then repeat that subtle binding and small plaster and do not tighten it as much as your first constriction, but subtly with it until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess, the redness, the pain, the inflammation, and all the symptoms are now completely subsided, and you judge there is no need for plaster or binding, then you repeat it as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if none of the conditions we have mentioned occur in the limb, then do not untie it until three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all this is left for twenty days depending on what appears to you upon loosening the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
And then adjust the binding more than in your first binding, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as is preceded by their recovery.
But if you see the site of the fracture drying and thinning more than is appropriate, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore, bathe it with lukewarm water every time you untie it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the binding a little, and by this operation nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a fractured limb do, when it is not set properly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their operation, and a great danger; and if it were right, the Ancients would have enlarged upon this in their books and would have worked with it.
And I have not seen anyone of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable that you do not do it.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the blow breaks all the bone up to the marrow, which is beneath the bone, just as it happens in a tree trunk, and therefore this type is called *ascial* (axial); or the sword cuts a part of the bone, and cuts its flesh but the incision does not go through to the other side; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta* (complete elevation/separation).
And the wound of these two fractures is either large or small, and there is fracture which is a contusion or attrition; and its cause is a blow with a blunt object or a fall on stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, so that it approaches the periosteum which is beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound of these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture which is hidden in the bone, as fine as a small hair, and therefore this type is called a hairline fracture.
And there is a fracture which is caused either by a fall or by a blow with a stone and the like, which causes some lamina of the bone to be driven inwards, and it is made in a concave place, just as happens to the plates of earthenware when a blow is struck and part of them is driven inwards.
And this happens more often in the bones of humid bodies, such as the skulls of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will bring everything back to its place with repositioning.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by touching them and by investigating them with probes, and by the presence of corrupt flesh that is over them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and it is wiped clean, and a probe is run over it, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider at the beginning the patient's symptoms, and then if you see by the symptoms that it signifies by manifest signs, such as vomiting of bile, extension (possibly referring to limb extension or prostration), loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, and swelling of the eyes and redness of them, and similar symptoms in the major conditions, without a doubt it is not healed (or, it will not heal).
And if you see no unusual symptoms and you expect recovery, then you begin his treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person has come to you at the beginning as injured, and this is in the winter days, then you must study the state of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to all circumstances.
And if it is in the summer days, then you must endeavor to set the bone before the seventh day, before that which is under the bone is corrupted by the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue), and before the symptoms that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the panniculus covering the brain, and is with small pieces and attrition (grinding or wearing away), then you must incise the comminuted and atrite part, as I will explain to you.
And you shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as best you can according to the nature of the injury, and that it be gentle on the patient.
And if you find, upon examination of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary, and that is to fill the area with cloths soaked in rose-colored wine and oil, and allow the injury to rest until the abscess is sedated (reduced), and you are sure of the cessation of bleeding; and then begin with the encirclement of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its form:  And then apply another incisor like this one, a little wider than that; and this is its form:
And then apply yet another, wider incisor than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a number of different incisors, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others, and let them be sharp at the tips of their ends, and let them be made of Indian iron or steel.
And use them easily in percussion on the incisor so that you do not strike the head and injure it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you apply the incisors with the drills, which are called non-penetrating drills.
And they are not called thus except because these do not reach the end of the skull bone to that which is near it, because the drill has a round end or edge on that which is below its sharp head, similar to an edge or a small circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take of these drills a great number, each of which is suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that you have present in all parts of the skull a tip which is sharp, the quantity in length and shortness being according to the quantity of thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the form of three types of drills: The method of perforating the circumference of the broken bone is that you place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is penetrated; and then move the drill to another place, and place [the drills] so that the space between each hole is the size of the radius or thereabouts.
And then incise with incisors that which is between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as possible in order to lighten it, as we have said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument which you will have prepared for this, such as small pincers and forceps.
And it is necessary that you take great care that the incisor does not touch any part of the brain.
And so when you have encircled the bone by perforating it, and it is separated from the brain if it is connected to it, and you have extracted it, it is necessary that you scrape and smooth its roughness from that which is on the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but however it must be thinner and finer than the other incisors.
And if some small and sharp fragments of bone remain, then take them away easily with whichever instrument you have available; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments which we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is easier, far from frightening, which Gualia describes and praises highly; and this is his statement: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin uncovering the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and have placed under it the tip of this slow and gentle incisor of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is divided into two edges lengthwise, like a knife; so that the lenticular part is fitted to the brain with its surface, the sharp part cutting into the bone.
And then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until you cut through all the bone easily as it is turned, and you are sure that the membrane will not suffer any accident that you fear in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and even if he were asleep.
Then, if any matter attached to the bone remains in the membrane in any part of the bone, cut it away with the lenticular end of that incisor, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate into the membrane, and what is cut away or removed from the bone is its surface, and there remain roughness and fine splinters, then you must scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, for which you have prepared a number, of various sizes so that it is possible for you to use in each place the most suitable and most appropriate of them according to what guides your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And you must proceed in your scraping, with which you scrape the bone, beginning with the broadest of those rasps, and then use progressively the more subtle ones, and do not cease to do this continuously until you arrive at using the finest and most subtle of all those rasps.
But in each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer care according to what guides you to their rectification.
And it is a matter that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And we have shown this which we have written above in the case of large fractures.
And if the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) is retracted when you scrape the bone, then you must take a cloth of linen according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place it over the thin cloth, doing this as gently as possible so as not to burden the patient; and then apply a linen bandage over this, but do not tighten it except to the extent that it holds the wound in place alone.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are sure of a warm abscess; and then unbind it and then administer medicines which counter excessive dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour, powdered lentils, and birthwort, and similar things.
And it is so that you make a powder of these medicines which is sprinkled over the wound, once they are dry; and universally, administer in this situation any medicine whose property is to cleanse and not to bite (i.e., cause further irritation).
And take care, according to your ability, that the wound in your treatment be clean; and that there be no filth of ointment or other matter; and do not allow virulence to increase in it; for when it is applied to the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts and poisons it, and causes grave harm to the patient.
And it affects the patient's head, as the bone is cleaned and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, if the patient suffers the consequences we have mentioned, know that it is undoubtedly pernicious.
And if there is blackness not from the medicine that is placed on top, but it is by virtue of that medicine that causes that blackness, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these things moisten a cloth, and then place it on the head; and then treat it with the appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of a broken nose.
Know that a broken nose is not broken in two parts together, but sometimes only one, because it has two bones; because the lower part is cartilaginous, and it is not broken, and it suffers only abrasion, crookedness, and sinuosity.
But if one of the two parts is broken, then you should insert your little finger into his nose, and align that fracture inside with your index finger, and with your thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and take care that your operation does not cause the patient pain.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it should be set with the end of a thin rod.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same.
And strive for his restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should treat the resulting abscess with cautery.
And then insert into the end of the nose a rolled-up piece of linen, if the fracture is in one part, or two small rolls, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the roll be of such a size as to fill the opening of the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the rolls should be dipped in a mixture (boder), and changed every day, but I have not seen this; rather it is necessary that the roll be soaked in egg white mixed with fine powder; and then leave the roll until the bone is set and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a roll, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, is inserted into the nose; and let this be done if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not prevented from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, make rolls.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, plaster the nose with cerate or cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then it is necessary that you plaster it externally with sesame flour and powdered chickpeas mixed with egg white; and then place linen cloth over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary that you make an incision over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then sew up the incision, and treat it with what causes granulation and consolidation, and with plasters suitable for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then it is necessary that you treat it with rolls and administer lead canulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two and is bent inwards, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with that the hump of the fracture inwards, towards the outer parts, with your other hand from the outside of the bone; thus properly setting it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from both sides according to the straightness until its alignment is possible.
And if concussion of teeth with disruption occurs, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place over the broken jaw a cerate, and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place on the cloth a suitably made large compress, or a piece of sole equal to the length of the jaw; and then bind that above according to how the binding is prepared for you and as the application requires, until it is healed.
And instruct the patient to use rest and quiet, and give him food of easily digestible lions. (The word "leons" here is likely a mistake and should probably be something like "liquids" or "broths".  The text seems to be implying a liquid or soft diet.)
And if you estimate that the shape is altered in any way, then you should look at it and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify what is altered and apply a plaster with finely ground powder, with egg white, or with starch, after you have removed the cerate, and place soft wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and adjusted over it, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it, do not unbind it until it is healed and the fracture is firm; because many times this fracture is firm in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have often said in its sedation until it is healed, and the abscess is resolved.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of the bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for removing them from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a phlebotomy lancet according to your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters that is suitable for this and will promote granulation, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
On the restoration of the clavicle when it is fractured.
Often the clavicle is broken in the front part, above the muscle, and this fracture happens in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore; or it is such that splinters are present, and it is difficult to restore; or it is such that the fracture is accompanied by a wound.
And the operation in this case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the splint and supports the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
Then bind the fracture with your bandages until its shape is made as needed, and there is neither a small prominence nor a concavity.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the armpit of the patient a pad of cloth or wool, and its size should be according to your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the pad with your hand until you bind the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle to the outer parts, because it has reached the sternum, then the patient should be supine on their neck, and you should place a moderately sized cushion on their muscle.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle that is on the sternum above is elevated, and then you straighten the fracture and bind it with your bandages.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are bad, then you should make an incision over it and extract those splinters easily.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should carefully incise it with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after you have placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves as a splint; and this instrument is of wood or iron, of which this is the form:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size or smallness of the bone.
But let its length be as long as is possible for you in the operation; that it has two ends like a spoon, and one end is wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you should approximate the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then soak a cloth in sour wine and rose oil and wine, and place it on that.
And ensure that the bandage is not loosened over the broken bone; and for this reason you should see the patient every day, so that when the ligament is softened or you see the bandage is loosened, you can then rectify this and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's pillow under their neck, and place a small cushion under their testicle at night; so that with this, their side is elevated from that, and therefore the fracture of the clavicle is elevated from the muscle; or let their arm be tied to their neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless an abscess or swelling occurs at the site, before twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the reduction and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle is restored and coagulated.
And it is strengthened and healed, according to the situation, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken on its lateral side, and not shattered, only the margins [are broken].
And so when the place [the shoulder blade] is broken—and it is broken in the middle of the place—and is not known except by touch, then, according to what the form of the fracture is, forcibly prepare it and reduce it to its natural form in every way possible to you.
Then place on the area a powder made from finely ground egg white and lion's wool; then place a poultice of doubled cloth; then place over it a smooth, finely woven bandage, according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if the bandage is concave in any place on the shoulder blade, then you should fill that concavity with lion's wool, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
Then bind it above with a long bandage, with decent constriction and firmness of the bandage, until it is not moved from its place.
And examine the bandage each day; and every time that it is loosened, bandage it again and tighten it, and straighten the bandage if it has shifted from its place.
And lay the patient on their healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 days or in 25.
And then when this number is complete, then you dissolve the bandage, and you should know for certain that this is of the bones of which the beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the fractured bone and places itself below the clavicle, then you incise over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle concerning the cauterization of an abscess if it occurs there.
Chapter 7.
On the restoration of a foot fracture.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster because they are more compact and less fragmented.
And among the accidents [complications] when the middle of the foot is broken, it inclines inward, and great pain occurs, as well as difficulty breathing, coughing, a strong pulse, and vomiting blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is evident and not hidden from observation/feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient should be placed supine on his back, with a cushion placed between his shoulders; then gently press on his muscles, and adjust the broken bones with hands from both sides, and be meticulous in this operation and in the setting, in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone is restored to its proper shape.
Then place a plaster and lint over it, and place over that a splint of thin willow or alder wood, or something similar in lightness, after wrapping it in cloth; and carefully bind this over the broken bone so that it is not moved; and use a bandage, round in shape, on the dorsal side sometimes, and tighten it with a decent firmness;  and regularly check the bandage, and tighten it when it loosens.
And if necessity demands loosening of the bandage because of corrosion, itching, pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then you should examine and loosen it, remove the plaster, and correct what has happened with appropriate treatment; and then reapply the plaster if it is appropriate; and adjust the tightness until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
On the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs occurs only in the thicker parts, which are two; and in the extremities, at the front part,  no such crushing occurs because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of it is not hidden from perception because of its investigation with the fingers.
And the restoration should be such that you align the fracture with your fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as it should be, and then apply a plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if that is needed.
And if the fracture of the ribs is towards the inner parts, then the patient experiences vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in someone with pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane; and he experiences difficulty breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the Ancients were ingenious in that with many contrivances.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we avoid this so that it does not easily cause a hot abscess if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then it helps with that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw with force; and this is similar to reasoning, but however, it is feared that the cupping glass will attract superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is full, so that the bandage is even as it envelops that according to roundness; and moreover, the patient should be treated with a treatment for pleurisy with food and medicine.
And if a vehement cause constricts the patient which he does not suffer, and the bone pushes the membrane with a piercing injury,  we fear for the patient, then it is necessary that we make an incision on the place, uncover the broken rib, and then place on it an instrument that preserves the *ciphac* (likely a misspelling or archaic term, possibly referring to a type of splint or bandage), the recollection of which is previously mentioned, and that we incise the bone with ease, and extract it.
And then we adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and we treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess forms inside, then you should take and mix powders in rose oil and place it on the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him be supine on the side on which he sleeps until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Chapter 9: On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and then comes their attrition, and similarly to the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider, for if you see his hands already softened and numb and dead, and he cannot move them, extend or flex them, and when you constrict them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most dispositions it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction in them with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if he shows in the vertebrae of the neck the same thing and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then observe his feet.
Then if you see that they are softened, the same thing that happened in the hands occurs in the feet, and also when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he is supine on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not work on his cure.
But if none of these things happen, the cause is better and lighter.
And the cure for him is that you should apply to the suppuration of the hot abscess,  which you place on the affected vertebra,  pure rose oil alone, or with boiled egg yolks; apply that there several times a day until the hot abscess is seated/reduced.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and that he not sleep on the side where he finds pain until he is healed.
And if it happens that because of the friction of the bone splinters or some cause it has separated from it, then you must cut it at the base and remove that bone; and then join the two edges of the wound with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the posterior part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the hip joint, then you should insert the index finger of your left hand into the rectum, and reposition the broken bone with your other hand as much as possible according to the second equalization; and then apply a plaster and splint, if you need them, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel broken splinters there, then you should remove them, and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the restoration of the hip.
Hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are, the fracture is only a separation at their extremities and is lengthwise, sloping inwards; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is its shape.
And if the fracture is only at its extremity, then you align that according to what is prepared for you by equal alignment until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or slopes downwards, then you have the patient lie on their stomach so that the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And then when you have aligned it, place a plaster over it, and then place a splint of wood or reed over that, and bind it tightly so that you do not fear a puncture of the fracture or displacement of the splint.
And fill the cavity with something that fills it until it takes the binding evenly, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is settled, and place on it something that settles it as has been previously described; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if splinters are found in the bone or it is comminuted (shattered), then you remove them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the collarbone (clavicle).
The collarbone (clavicle) is that which is between the side and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at the two extremities, and then it should be suspended from a raised position.
And seat the patient on a stool; and then place his broken arm over the splint until it reaches his armpit, in the middle of which the curve of the splint should be attached.
And then suspend some heavy object from it, or the attendant should extend it downwards; and then the physician should set the fracture with his hands, until the fracture returns to its proper place.
And the other method is that the patient should be lying supine on his back and suspend the arm from his neck with a bandage; and then command two assistants that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands; and the other hold the lower part; and each of them should extend to his part.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then tighten it over the fracture with a bandage and over that with another bandage, and each of the two assistants should extend to their two parts.
And so if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the armpit and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that place and over that elbow.
Equalize that with ease and without effort, and then when it is equalized as needed and is applied with good application, then tighten it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the constriction until the seventh day, and place on it soiled wool soaked in sour wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you tighten that.
And the way to tighten that is to place a plaster over the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand over its muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm on the support so that the arm is in a fixed position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is so that you place over the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is so that your bandage over the fracture site should be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you proceed.
And if you fear a festering abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then consider the bandage in all parts for three days so that no itching or inflammation occurs in the area; or it is forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the pressure of the tight bandage; and then rectify all that according to what we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place over the injured area a poultice full of well-carded wool, and check every hour of the night or day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or distorted, or that the bandage is not softened; then rectify all this with your skill.
And give the patient's food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until he begins to recover strength; and then it is appropriate that you give him thicker food.
Because it is customary for the injured limb and leg to be bandaged for forty days; and then they should be unbound and a bath should be administered and they should be treated with ointments that rectify this.
And if the fracture is severely damaged, then you should not untie the bandage and splints until after ten days or even two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two focils; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and is that which is placed below the small finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger focil is broken alone, or the smaller, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small focil is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the focil is broken below, the fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the small focil above, then it is convenient for the physician, before its restoration, that he applies slight extension easily until it is aligned.
But if the large focil is what is broken, then it is necessary to apply a more forceful extension.
And if both focils are broken together, then you must apply the extension much more strongly.
And it is necessary that you place the figure of your hand during its restoration and its extended extension on a cushion, and that the pulse of the hand be in the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the auricular finger be lower than the other fingers, and the patient be lying on a squared pillow.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer from exertion.
Then the minister should extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another minister should extend it above similarly.
And then the physician should fit the bone until he reduces it to the best possible position.
And if the fracture of the bone is jagged, then you must forcefully reduce all the pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated jagged piece appears in it, and you have no hope of its restoration, then you should cut it off and remove it according to the manner which we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dedicated a separate chapter to this, and therefore take the treatment from that.
And if an abscess occurs near the beginning of your treatment, then you should line a cloth with a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, of a consistency between thick and thin, and bind the cloth tightly over it until the abscess has subsided; and then remove the plaster and apply a poultice prepared from crushed molli with egg white, and then apply a compress; and let the compress which is placed over the fracture be thicker and firmer.
And know that the number of compresses on the arm is varied according to the major conditions, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your binding over the fracture site firmly and tightly, and if the binding is closer to the upper parts of the fracture or to the lower parts of it, apply the binding a little more loosely, as was mentioned earlier at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough, and the bandage with which it is bound should be of a consistency midway between thin and thick, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any complication arises requiring correction, such as itching that occurs in the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the binding.
And if the fracture is now softened and the bone is reset and similar to the others, then correct all this with your skill.
And further consider whether nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the binding, for then it is necessary to loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient experiences none of the complications we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for about twenty days or thereabouts.
Then let the patient's hand be suspended by its own agitated movements, and make it sleep on its back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or even quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the strength of the individual.
Chapter 13.
On the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the wrist and finger joints; instead, they often suffer from attrition.
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then the patient should lie down, and a cushion should be placed beneath him to ensure even support, and then place his hand on the extended cushion.
Then the assistant should extend the broken bones, and the physician should align them until they are properly joined.
Then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess is present; and then apply a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and wrap it in linen.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm, then make a kind of cloth ball, and instruct the patient to hold it with his fractured palm; then it should be bound tightly with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather, with cloth in which it is wrapped, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as necessary.
But if the fracture is in the outer parts, then it is necessary to place a bandage above and another below in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, in the manner that the hand is bound to the splint between the fingers with bandages.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the finger knuckles, then if it is the thumb, it should be bandaged as necessary and then bound to the palm; and if you wish, place a small straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the middle finger, or the index finger, or the ring finger, or the little finger, then it should be bandaged and bound to the finger next to it; or all should be bound together continuously, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your treatment, and in addition to that, the disposition of hot abscesses and oppose — with your operation — what is necessary when any of these things occur, according to the repeated description of them.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and is felt according to whether it is broken at the front or the back part.
And its restoration is done in this way: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then the physician stretches the entire bandage to its extent, according to its quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the root of the thigh, then the bandage should be close to the knee, on the side of the kneecap, so that the extension happens upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then the bandage should be placed close to the knee, and the extension should be to the parts below.
And then the physician joins the bone with both his hands until he reduces it according to its natural shape and the bone is joined by a good join; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, if an abscess does not occur in the limb. But if an abscess occurs there, then you leave it for a few days until the abscess is reduced, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made like this:  You should wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the root of the thigh.
And insert a long strip of material between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the strip come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh that which is superfluous from the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the location of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is firm.
And then begin with a firm bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wraps, and the farther you move away from the fracture site, the less tight, lighter, and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the strip to the lower parts until they reach the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not dislodged from its place.
And then leave the bandage on it, so that it does not cause corrosion, hot abscess, swelling, or anything similar to these in the limb; and if any of these things occur, then loosen it, and correct what has happened immediately, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone that protrudes, then you must replace it as best you can; and if not, dress it and keep it in place, and treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it heals.
And sometimes this thigh fracture is tightened further after splints have been applied, just as we have said in the case of the arm.
However, in the restoration made in this way, the patient does not experience lameness; and if only one leg is restored, without the other leg being applied to it, then it is necessary that he will limp on the one that is always affected.
And know that the thigh is bandaged for 40 days or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but it often causes attrition (or wearing away).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or break in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and above all it is accompanied by pain.
And its restoration is such that what is broken of its parts is joined together with said splints until it is united and conjoined as much as possible by equalization, ease, and fabrication (or setting).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need one; and bind it above with a bandage suitable for this.
And then consider all the preparations that we have recommended in other fractures, such as a hot poultice and similar things, so that all accidents are countered with what is convenient for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large and is named by the name of the leg; and the other is thin, and it is named fibula.
And the same kinds of fractures happen to these two bones of the leg as happen to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and its operation is one and the same.
And if both bones are broken together, the leg is deformed in all parts.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is deformed in the front parts.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find that below, and it is among those things not easily seen by you.
Then administer extension, setting, and bandaging of the splints according to that same method.
However, if the leg fracture is large, having many splinters, the extension should be less and lighter, and alleviate it with your skill.
And in the leg, there is a certain operation similar to that on the arm, and when you apply the splints and complete your operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood, which are placed under the parts which are placed on the soles, and are made equally from palm branches; choose those of small thickness, and let none be slender, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the very bottom.
Then wrap each one in two cloths according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, and let them extend from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then tie the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle; for with this structure, the leg is prevented from bending to the right or left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small wooden splint, according to the length of the leg, has been prepared; and let the leg be placed on it so that it is kept from movement.
And especially it is necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound properly so called with it.
And then examine the leg every day and study it carefully, and watch it for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar problems; and if any of these problems arise, then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes rarely occur, and what does happen to them is more attrition (wear and tear) in the case of bad disposition (meaning poor health or vulnerability).
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and those bones are elevated or displaced from each other, then the patient should place their foot on the ground prepared as before.
Then place one foot on the elevated part of those bones, and then tread/press on them, and squeeze them until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and lint on top, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two flat pieces are attached.
Then bind that tightly to the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other necessary materials.
And when three or four days have passed for him, then unbind the bandage, for you will find the bones joined, or whether they are fractured or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some say they are fractured, then restore them and join them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place a splint on the fractured finger according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little longer than it; and place under the foot that board which I have mentioned to you, and bind it with a proper bandage.
But if what is fractured of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in linen cloth, and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board outside the sole of the foot so that it holds it with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you do not forget that you consider all the things which I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is necessary.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the woman's hip is fractured, then make her lie down in a low position, and gently incline her to one side a little, and let her be held behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made in her hip like a sphere; and then the woman should be sewn, and her hip raised little by little, because all this is expelled until the part of the hip is in front like a sphere and the fractured bone returns.
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and then she urinates, and reduce and return it according to the manner in which you treated it at the beginning, and then return to her first position.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it is restored.
And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and attach a reed tube to its opening; and insert the whole bladder into her hip, and then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will help the fracture to heal.
And then it should be filled with cotton and remain so for several days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is broken, then administer for its restoration and healing that which we have recommended for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these near and easily occurring fractures, especially for one who studies and uses and understands this my book well; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest dispositions the right way in its restoration and stricture, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a broken penis, take hen's guano and put the penis in it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and let it remain thus for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar, that you attend to and phlebotomize him immediately if the conditions for phlebotomy testify to it as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you attend to stopping it such that you powder over it crushed egg shells, if no other cause is present.
And then begin to restore the fracture on that same day, and do not prolong it, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent and uncovered above the skin, then you must carefully reduce it and align it with your hands easily and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands with this instrument; and it is an instrument which is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers, and the width of which is according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, according to the quantity needed for this in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent by the compression on it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its ends; and let the top of it be of a tapering thickness, and from the middle of it to the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem", that is, a small spatula.
Because it is necessary that its sharp end be raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and let it be held with some device.
And then strive to align the ends of the fracture, and if the broken end of the bone is thin, and does not receive the instrument well, then you must incise the end of that bone until the instrument has power over it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recounted, then incise it with whatever is suitable from the incisors that we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient feels vehement, persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to give the patient great relief.
When your restoration of the bone is completed, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you may incise the opening with scissors and use dressings according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and caused death or a corrosive or festering illness, that is, gangrene, in their patients. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a dressing of hard cloths instead of stitches and bind it with those.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to generate pus, then you remove the cloth which you had placed over it with wine, and then administer poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to medicate wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is necessary for you to untie the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and closed, and it is necessary that the limb be prepared in such a way that the pus flows from it downwards easily.
If many days pass and the wound is not consolidated nor is the pus removed from it, then know that there are gatherings of small [things] because it is necessary to explore the wound with a probe. And of those gatherings, those that are separated, remove and extract them; those which are not separated from their surroundings and cause pain in the limb, you must incise them as far as it is possible for you.
And if a swelling or ulcer occurs in the wound—that is, an abscess, or another type of corruption and putrefaction—then it is necessary that you treat each one of these with what is suitable for it, of whose cure a narration is given previously in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should address and you should keep in mind: when a large bone is broken, especially in a limb such as the thigh bone and similar large bones, and you do not attempt to pull it out, or its extraction because often death ensues from that; rather leave it until it suppurates, for it will fall out quite easily in about twenty or thirty days; and then cure the wound if you see fit, and if not, leave it alone.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the treatment of swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of healing of a fracture, and especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it quickly inhibits the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and administer medicines that have a styptic effect, such as aloe, enses (likely a misspelling or archaic term, perhaps referring to a specific herb), myrrh, cerecloth, and acacia, and similar; so that you take some or all of those, and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply it to the swelling on lint, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage tight; do not loosen it for many days; and then loosen it and reapply another, until the swelling is reduced; or apply a lead plate firmly, because lead has the property of reducing anything that is swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already become hardened and constricted, and necessity requires its removal carefully, then incise it in the most superior part, and incise the excess and prominent part, or scrape it with a sharp instrument until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when it is set, and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is set, and afterwards the limb remains thin and weak, this is caused by several reasons: one of which is an excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not as it should be; or by excessive tightening of the ligaments so that nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or by excessive and superfluous embrocation; or by excessive movement not at the right time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and by weakness of the patient.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and make his heart cheerful so that his blood is increased; and administer baths; and introduce joy and merriment to him.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with lukewarm water until nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22. Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When, in a limb already restored to healing, there is crookedness and a prominence at the fractured bone and swelling, and because of this there is a deformity of the limb, but nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the word of someone who claims that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and bone-setters who have done this in our land; and this practice is much to be condemned, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in warm water in which softening herbs are boiled, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and a softening plaster should be applied, such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be made and mixed with white clay or with olive oil, and a plaster should be made with it; or fat figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon droppings, and similar things from among the medicines called consolidating emollients.
And sometimes it is resolved with gentle, frequent rubbing with moist hands, and movement of the limb in every direction should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become severe and hardened, and surgical treatment is required, then the excess should be carefully removed and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which superfluously swells around the bone should be incised with fine scalpels, and relief should be provided with care and skill.
Chapter 23.
Concerning speech on dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, wherefore movement is prevented, and the shape of the limb is deformed, causing great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation happens to someone, then it is necessary to immediately strive to reduce it, and not delay this reduction, for if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and very quickly the reduction of the dislocation is made difficult.
And for this reason it should not be moved or stretched at the time of inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and then let it rest until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated so that its function returns to its proper place.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what preceded in fracture; from the highest part of the body to the lowest part.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, and this dislocation happens in one of two ways: either they are displaced from their places by slight movement, and are only slightly softened; or they are dislocated by complete and full dislocation, so that they are softened at the joint, to the point that saliva flows from the patient and they cannot retain it or close their mouth, and their tongue is entangled in their speech.
But when their dislocation is slight, then in most cases it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and full, then a reduction must be administered promptly, and it should not be delayed at all.
And let the assistant hold the patient's head, and let the physician insert the thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or let him insert both thumbs together if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands should be outside with which he will pull; and he commands the patient to relax their jaws and allow them to move from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer a vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then, when they are returned and pulled together, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on it some cloths sprinkled with cerate, and it should be made of wax and oil mixed; and then it should be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head should be placed between two pillows, so that it does not lean to the right or left; and do not force them to chew anything; before their meal, let their food be liquid, until when the pains are reduced and the jaws are knit together, then let them eat what they want.
And this should be administered easily, and do not work on opening the mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is knit together and healed.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and continuous thirst occur, and the patient's belly is quickly distended, and they quickly vomit pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is perilous; and many times he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards by its connection with the breastbone; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lie on his back and extend his arms. And then compress the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
And then place a plaster and powders on it and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is the hip and is continuous with it, is not dislocated in any way; then it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is appropriate to you.
And then place a plaster, and powders, and a bandage on it, and command the patient to adhere to tranquility and rest until it is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated only in three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated to the back parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes to the lower parts below the clavicle, and especially in those whose flesh is little; it is easily dislocated; but in those in whom there is much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it easily happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is believed to be dislocated because of this.
Then it is necessary that you prove this before you are completely certain of it, and then you proceed to its cure.
And its dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the clavicle; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity, and below the clavicle, towards the touch of the head of the muscle, as if it were an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.
If it is dislocated towards the feet or upwards, and you then find a manifest touch, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is fresh and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands under his clavicle, and raises the joint strongly upwards to its place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns easily.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and much time has passed since the dislocation first occurred, many days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and that a poultice be applied that softens and relaxes, such as cooked roots of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should be supine on his back and a wool pad, of a consistency between soft and firm, should be placed under his clavicle; and then the physician should place his heel on the pad, and raise the head of the muscle forcefully, and pull the patient's arm so that it is not pulled downwards, and another assistant should hold the patient's head so that it is not pulled downwards, for then it will immediately return to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method:  that you have present a man who is taller than the patient, and he should stand on the affected side, and insert his shoulder under the patient's clavicle and raise the clavicle upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another assistant pulls the patient's arm from under their belly. But if the patient is light, then something else should be suspended with him to weigh him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily in another way:  a long, round-topped post, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, is fixed in the ground. Then, lion-colored cloths are placed on top of the post, and the patient stands along the length of the post, and then his arm is extended downwards on the other side; and his body is pulled forcefully from the other side, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if its reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: that you take a stick, two cubits long and four fingers wide, and its thickness should be lightened at the end near the clavicle in this way:
And then, lion-colored cloths should be tied over the rounded end so that the stick does not hurt the patient.
Then it should be placed under the patient's clavicle, and the hand or arm should be extended onto the stick down to the lower parts, and the stick should be tied above the armpit and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm should be placed on a rung of a ladder according to its width, and the hand should be extended downwards, and the rest of the body should be suspended on the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its reduction is completed in whatever way possible for you, then you should place under the clavicle a ball of wool of suitable size; and then place a plaster prepared from ground myrtle powder and egg white over the whole muscle, so that it is wrapped above, and then tighten it below the clavicle with a decent bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and his hand should be attached to his neck, and it should be left, and his hand should not be moved for seven days.
And it is necessary that the patient's diet be light until the limb is strengthened, for it is easier for its healing.
And then the diet should be increased gradually over five or seven days, and movement should be exercised; and therefore if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to humidity affecting it or another cause, then in that case cautery should be administered with three punctures, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the bandage are applied to it several times, and it is not firm and gives way and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that its nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are either severed, stretched, or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
For the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the posterior parts, reduction is done with impulsion and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And let another bandage be applied to it, and treat it until it is healed.
And if during healing there is heaviness in the limb and slowness in its movement, then let the patient use a bath many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its former nature.
Chapter 27.
Of the treatment of hip dislocation.
Know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so to the front than to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is apparent to the sight or to the touch, according to whatever manner it is dislocated. And when you adjust the dislocated hip to its place, this is manifestly clear to you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the leg, nor can it touch its muscle with it.
And it is necessary that you take care, and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess develops, for if a hot abscess develops, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is in the back, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and more painful, and often results in death.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that the patient's leg be extended with two hands, and the patient's thigh be extended, and the physician's hands be placed upon the hip and underneath it, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is to the front, then return it thus: bend the leg with your hand, until you strike the hip with the base of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong and very forceful extension.
And it is necessary that two assistants extend the arm, and let those two assistants hold it firmly so that it is not moved during the extension.
And then the arm should be rotated in every direction, after it has been wrapped with a long, doubled cloth over the patient's hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this may help lubricate the joint more easily; and then push the joint with forceful pressure until it returns to its place.
And after the reduction, it is necessary that a plaster be applied which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and it should be tightly bound with a descending bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left like that for some days.
And afterwards it should be unbound; and then if the joint is set in its place, then you unbind its bandage and leave it.
And if you see the joint is not well secured, then you reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it for some days until it is tightly bound; and afterwards unbind it.
But if the reduction of the joint causes the patient pain, and their condition is agitated, then administer moist heat in a bath and gentle massage and compression, until they are relieved; or apply poultices of aleliati, that is, very fatty substances; and then it should be bandaged, and left on the bone day and night. And afterwards remove that, and place it in a bath; and when it is sufficiently softened, then you rub the joint with a tempered massage, and afterwards reapply the aleliati, that is, very fatty ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the aid of a bath, until it is supple.
And if you wish, apply a warm, moist cow's bladder over it, tied tightly; and do this several times, for it is moist and helps to reduce the inflammation.
Chapter 28.
Of the treatment of a dislocated wrist, that is, of the joint between the arm and the hand.
A dislocated wrist is sometimes easily reduced, unlike other joints. However, speed is essential in its reduction at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes inflamed or a hot abscess forms.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the physician places his hand or palm on the prominence of the joint and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already facing the abdomen; then the patient places the back of their hand on a table during extension and reduction.  If the dislocation is on the back of the hand, then the hand should be placed internally on the table so that the physician's hand can reach that prominence of the joint.
And so if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then compress it with a poultice to reduce the inflammation and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not succeed in its reduction if more days pass.
However, if the joint remains distorted, and the patient experiences no pain except that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then know that the nerves are pinched or bruised. In this case, there is no remedy except to cauterize near the injury and quickly apply a bandage.
Therefore, when the hand is replaced, apply the poultice we have recommended, and let it remain compressed for five days; then unwrap it, let it rest, and exercise the hand.
But if its movement is impaired and some heaviness occurs, then soothe it with warm water and massage several times, until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of finger dislocations.
Sometimes fingers are dislocated in every direction.
And when a finger is dislocated towards the back of the palm or towards its belly (the front), then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your fingers, until it returns to place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend it below the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened and aligned on that day.
And when night comes, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for some days until it is tight (healed/firm).
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts (of the body).
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to one of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are dislodged from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death is expected for the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and many times some of their limbs are weakened, or both legs, or both arms, or one of these; or one vertebra is dislodged from its place, because many times it is dislodged, and many times the displacement is in four directions.
Therefore, that [vertebra] is dislodged to the back and is called yellowness (jaundice/possibly referring to a discoloration indicative of the severity).
But the cure is that then you consider if the yellowness (jaundice/discoloration) comes from a fever, because then in that case there is no cure nor healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or from a blow or similar to those, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with long discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have already abridged that, the brevity of which excuses the excess of it, due to my proximity to my intended exposition, with which I have exposed and formulated this from various instruments, with which I will show this and explain that.
And of those, only that which occurs in the two [sides/feet - possibly specifying a more precise location than the previous lines] specifically is cured with what I have recounted.
And it is so that the patient should be stretched out on their back against a wall, and a soft mattress should be placed underneath them so that their feet are not injured.
And then a straight pole should be placed, fixed in the earth at the edge of the bed near the patient's head, and another pole near the patient's feet at the other end of the bed.
And the assistant should hold the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another assistant should hold the other [pole] in the same manner.
And then wrap a strong linen bandage around the patient's head and neck; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is near their head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around their hips, their buttocks, and their legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is near the patient's feet.
And then each assistant should stretch the bandages to the part of the pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be removed from their places where they are fixed, but however, they are not fixed as we have said [before].
And the physician should place his palms on the spine with firmness until it returns [to its proper position], or place a board on it, and then adjust his feet on the board until it returns [to its proper position].
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and make a hole in the wall which we have said is near the patient, into which the end of the board fits. And then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician place his feet on the other end, and press firmly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, use a lathe which is rotated by hand; and you should place in the ground near the patient's head at the back of the neck two poles, the length of which is one arm's length, and near the patient's head at the back of the neck likewise two poles; and the distance between each pole should be one palm, and there should be a hole in each pole through which the lathe passes, and each should be firmly fixed in the ground so that it cannot be moved.
And there should be a round pole on which the lathe is mounted, and it should be rotated in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole into which the pole is fitted, the length of which is one palm including that which is rotated; and the two other poles are similar to this one.
And then tighten the ropes that you have tied to the patient's feet in the hole which is near their head, and the ropes that you have tied to their thighs at the lathe which is near their feet.
And then near each lathe let there be a servant who turns the lathe with his hand, and the physician manipulates the spine as we have said.
And then, after the spine is returned and the place is manipulated, then it is necessary that you apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a piece of cloth whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length is sufficient to cover the area of the curvature and the healthy part of the spine.
And then it should be bound with the rope that we have mentioned, and nourish the patient with light food until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing, then it is necessary that medicines be administered which soften and smooth, with the application of the cloth for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is then applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the back of the spinal vertebrae, and is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made upon it with this medicine, for it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and in them does not occur what occurs in other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, or outwards, or forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its dislocation inwards is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain, and this is the place where the pain is often accompanied by a hot abscess, because the head of the femur has already arrived there.
And the sign of that to which dislocation outwards occurs, is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And a sign of that to which dislocation forwards occurs is that he extends his leg completely, but nevertheless cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so forwards; and his urine is retained and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign of that to which dislocation backwards occurs is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and the hip is softened, and the head of the femur is behind that place.
But the reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, that it is already healed by having it close at hand you administer its reduction and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not completely cured; and therefore it is not fitting that presumption be made in this.
But in one whose dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care that you return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it very easily returns and needs no other treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then it is necessary that you prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with his hands, or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extend the hand of that one from above so that he places his hands below the patient's testicles; and then tighten with a linen bandage around the root of the thigh, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from the inside of the hip to the fork, or from the back to the back. (More literally: And let the extension be from him or from the inner part to the hip to the part of the fork, or from the back part to the part of the back.)
And let the extension of all these be at once until the patient is lifted with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type that which we shall say of its own cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is to the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be supine on his sound side; and then place the ligaments on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place that is below the groin; and then extend the ligament upwards from the part of the groin to the highest part of the fork (pubic area).
And then another strong assistant should take his arms, and grasp the thick part of the affected thigh and extend it outwards with a vehement extension, because by this it will return to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, by which this member is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is difficult for you and it does not yield to treatment with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be tied together with a strong, light bandage, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each (bandage) be four fingers' breadth, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the amount of two fingers' breadth.
And then the patient should be suspended by the head from a beam, and let him be inside the house; and let his length from the ground be the amount of two arms' lengths.
And then command a strong young man to lessen the head of the thigh, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, and the other young man, lessening the thigh with strength, should pull, for the joint returns to its place with speed.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, the patient should lie on his back, as we have recounted in the case of yellow jaundice; and let the bandage be strongly tied above the affected leg and on his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then let suitable beams be placed in the middle of the elevated part upon which wet cloths should be wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that the extension to the lower parts is not pulled.
And then each assistant should extend to his part, and the physician with his hand should guide the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narrative on a raised surface; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the dislocated joint of the patient, and then grasps it with the other hand, and with that grasp he extends it downwards to the joint of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended downwards, but elevated above the ground; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we have said about his lying on two cushions; and he is on his face and the ligaments should be extended, as we have said, not very much.
And it is necessary that compression be applied with a tablet/bandage to the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is accomplished as it should be — and the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you, and that is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient straightens his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the limb is returned as it should be — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it tightly so that the hip is not moved in any direction; and the patient should adhere to rest for three or four days.
And then untie the ligaments and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening (or weakening), then you return and plaster that, and bind that according to your first binding, and leave that for three days.
And then untie that, and make him delay in walking about for a few days until he is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards, more towards the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration for all its types is that you make the patient lie down straight, so that he extends his leg, if he can;  apply your two hands to his face, and place his foot between your feet; and then apply his knee to your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee firmly, and let another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And a sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to his thigh easily and without difficulty.
And then plaster it and make the leg adhere to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if its reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with the ligatures about which the treatment of the hip has already given an account.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus.  (Talus refers to the ankle bone)
The talus is sometimes dislocated by a slight movement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and its dislocation occurs either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the talus swells, extending towards the part to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its slight displacement is by gentle reduction, and it is that it should be extended easily with the hands and manipulated until it returns [to its place].
But in its treatment when it is completely dislocated, it is necessary that you make the patient lie down straight, and that a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind by the back at his middle.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from the upper side, and with your left hand from the lower side of the foot at the ankle joint.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand twice, and then extend with the left; and push the sole of the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice as we have described.
And then push the sole of the foot against the leg a third time, and you are at the ankle.
Then it returns in one or two attempts according to this manner, and if you see the foot set, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on it, for it will return.
But if reduction is forbidden to you by what we have recounted, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tighten a strongly fixed pulley, so that it falls between their thighs, and you have already wrapped a cloth around them so that the patient does not suffer.
And then let the patient's attendant hold their thighs, and then another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the ankle; and then let each attendant extend against the extension of their partner, and the pulley should be between the patient's thighs holding it back, so that their body is not pulled downwards beyond its extension.
And then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh lower down, because the dislocation returns easily.
And so when the dislocation is reduced and the success of the reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with bandages.
And you must be careful or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not tight and injures them severely.
And then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
And then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and corrupted, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, then you must administer to its healing that which we narrated before, in another place of treatment and application, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocation of the toes of the feet.
It is necessary that that which is dislocated be healed with little extension without effort; and that which is not difficult, beforehand is light/easy.
But if the dislocation is in any of the bones of the foot, then you must make the patient place his foot on a level place on the ground or on a table, and remain thus as if walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on that which protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is healed and no prominence appears in the place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the whole foot, to which are two ends, and then bind that with a decent and firm bandage for three days; and then unbind it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of these things happen, and you exert yourself in its cure and in his restoration, many times death occurs.
And therefore it is not fitting that one should presume upon his cure, except he who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow, not-rash nor presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning medicines that only subdue hot abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except for that one in whom you expect salvation from loss, with alleviation of the illness, and in whom some hope appears. And then exert yourself immediately to make his reduction at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen which subdues hot abscesses and cure the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and splintered bones occur, then you must exert yourself in setting them, and do in this what we have said in the simple illnesses of what precedes in those places.
And guard and avoid, according to your virtue, that entry into the paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for that is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more salutary to your true body in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
