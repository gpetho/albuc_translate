Of the abscess of the testicles  
Know that in the cutting of this branch there is fear in many situations, which is why it seems to me that it is often better to leave it alone;
And I will tell you the work and the types of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come to the body, and especially to the testicles; and this happens for many reasons.
That is, from sour and sharp excess, which spreads to the testicles, or from a blow;
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it does not cause pain, and it is a serious abscess;
And sometimes it is a serious, fearful, and dangerous abscess, and of dark color, and sometimes it comes from a node in the artery, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from a node in the artery, it is known by the hot abscessâ€™s disposition when you press it with your fingers;
And you should not touch it.
The one that is made from swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the expression of finger touch,
And it is possible to make an incision on this kind, and on the other flesh;
And it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then extend the testicle upwards, and pull it out from the white sac, and free the suspensory from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already attached to these born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle and cut it;
And if it is attached to the sac, or in what is inside the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that tissue and cut it roundly.
And if the growth of the flesh is in the back place, then it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is done, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other cures until it is healed.
