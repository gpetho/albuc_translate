Oh you, very dear sons, I have completed this book for you, which is the last in the science of medicine along with its completion, and I have finished it through its expositions and explanations. And it has come to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, namely, "surgery."
And because the work of hands is neglected in our region and completely forsaken, the science has perished and been cut off, with nothing remaining but the small descriptions in the books of the ancients that hands have moved. From this have come errors and vanities, intentions have been closed off, and science has been distanced.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it along with the organization of this treatise according to the way of exposition and explanation and abbreviation; and I will present the forms of cautery instruments, and other tools of the work with the addition of their explanation and preparation, as needed.
And because no good master of hands is found in our time, the art of medicine is distanced. Therefore, it is necessary for one who takes it up to surpass in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the judgment of the members, their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, the number of bones, the movement and veins, both moving and resting, and the location of their exits.
And because of this, Hippocrates says that name with name is much, and with work is little; especially in the art of hands.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the aforementioned things should beware of falling into error and killing people; as I have seen many times those who undertake this science and abandon it without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish doctor who cut an abscess of scrofula on a womanâ€™s neck and cut the arteries of the neck; so much blood came out that the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another doctor who removed a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; he took away a piece of the bladder with it, and the man died within three days.
I had already been called to extract it, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it were cut, he would die.
And I saw another doctor who treated a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and along with the break, there was a wound; and the ignorant doctor tightly bound the fracture over the wound with strong bandages and did not leave any room for breath, and left it like that for a time; and he commanded that it should not be untied; and it remained like that until the leg and foot were completely swollen and came to ruin.
I was called to him, and I hastened to untie the leg; and when I had untied it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But the corruption was already established in the member, and I could not heal it; and the corruption continued to spread through the member until it was completely lost.
And I saw another doctor who opened an abscess that had become cancerous, and then inflamed it further through the malice of his treatment.
For a cancer, when it is pure from melancholic humor, should not be touched with iron unless it is in such a place that all that is corrupted can be removed.
And therefore, dear sons, it is necessary for you to know that the work of hands is divided into two parts: that is, work where there is danger in many conditions; and I will show in each place in this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be cautious so that foolish doctors cannot speak ill of you.
So take up your arms with caution, and treat your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you come to health and are praised; and leave the terrifying diseases of serious healing; and take away your arms from what makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may come from this world to the other in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: "Do not take on a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish doctor."
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauteries by fire and by sharp medicine, and the chapter is arranged from the head to the feet; and about the forms of instruments, and the tools of cautery, and all that is necessary for the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and about cupping and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things; and the chapter is arranged with the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and distortions, and similar things; and it is arranged from the head to the feet, and about the forms of instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I speak of the quality of the help and harm of each complexion.
I say that the quality of the help and harm is the most complex and subtle science and the hidden secret; and many wise men have spoken about it, and they have agreed on it; and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery universally helps every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion with matter, some have said that cautery is of great help; and others have said the opposite: that cautery is not suitable for diseases that come from heat and dryness.
For the nature of fire is hot, and it should not be treated for hot disease by heat, nor by dryness; and he who says the opposite says that cautery greatly helps hot and dry diseases that come into the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of a man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it sometimes by experiment.
And in any case, let it not be taken up except by one who has proven it and who knows through long use the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of the complexions of men, and the conditions and causes of their diseases, and the circumstances and the span of time; we have no fear of the other complexions, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all the doctors gathered and agreed on the cautery.
And know, sons, that cautery with fire is one of the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and comes only to the member that is burned, and harms other members little.
Burning medicines move from one member to another, causing diseases of serious healing to come to the member; and by chance, they kill the patient.
The fire, due to its high quality and the goodness of its substance, does not do this unless there is an excess.
And this I have found by experiment and by the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and based on the truth of things; and therefore I apologize for the length of the discourse, for it does not please me to withhold the secret that is hidden in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels diseases from bodies, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be done, and chose springtime.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the arising harm is mitigated by the help of cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary and urgent pains that cannot wait for a time lest greater malice come to the member.
And do not ever think, dear son, as foolish doctors do; for the disease that is cured by cautery does not return; and they say so; but it is not as they think, because cautery is a medicine that changes the complexion and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and it is more effective than medicine because of the speed of its effect, and because of the virtue of its work and its power.
And it is possible that the disease sometimes comes according to the complexion of the patient and the place of the disease and its power; and the superfluities are gathered in him through the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cauteries are administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, like cauteries of teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last of medicine, and it is true; but they do not believe that cautery is effective after medicine, but their intentions are false, and cautery is the last of medicine because when we administer ways of cures for any disease and they are not effective, then we administer the cautery, and it is effective. Then it is clear that cautery is the last of medicine, not according to the intention of foolish doctors.
The ancients said that a cautery instrument of gold is better than iron, and they said this because of the quality of gold and the excellence of its substance; and they said that the place of cautery does not become rotten, but this is not true because I have proven it, and I have found it true in some men; and a cautery of gold is more effective than one of iron, as they said.
However, when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly; and if you heat it too much, it becomes deformed; and thus there is enough hindrance.
And therefore we use iron cauteries that we have more adapted to our work.
Now I have arranged this chapter from the head to the feet, so that the way is easier to find.
Concerning the olive-shaped cautery
This cautery is effective for moisture and coldness in the brain, and there are two types made for a disease called "soda", and for many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for the multitude of dreams, toothache, and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from coldness such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method for this cautery is that the patient is purged by a laxative medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and habits of the patient can endure; then shave the patientâ€™s head.
Then make him sit cross-legged with his hands on his chest; afterward place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes; and where your middle fingers rest, make an incision there and then heat the cautery called "olivare", which has this shape:
And place it on the marked spot with ink, and gently press down while rotating your hand slightly; then lift your hand quickly, and examine the spot to see if you see a small piece of bone; if not, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have described; then take a little salt, put it in water and soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter; and leave it until the burn is gone; afterward treat the wound with an ointment called "tetrafarmaÃ§on" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it is cleansed; and for this reason it helps greatly.
And some of them said that the cautery should be left on until part of the bone is burned, and then scrape off what is burned from the bone, and it will be healed.
And others say that the cautery should be left on and pressed so hard that it removes a piece of bone as large as a spindle that women use, so that the humors are completely expelled; and the wound should be left open for a long time; afterward, it should be cleaned and closed.
And these two methods of cautery do not seem good to me overall, except in some men where there is a way of fear; and it seems to me that I should leave it; for the head is weakened by the continuous solutions of nature, as we witness in other members; and especially when the patientâ€™s head is weak by nature, and the first method of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use this method to work together for healing.
Of the old headache
When chronic pain comes in the whole head and lasts a long time, the patient should use salves and pills called "cochie", and purgatives for the head and oils and plasters; and if the cautery we mentioned before is applied and it does not work.
Be cautious if the patientâ€™s head is of strong nature and not too cold; then cauterize just below the previously mentioned cautery.
Then make a cautery on each corner of the head down to the bone, as we have mentioned before, and make one cautery in the place called "vasselz"; it is a place where cups are applied; and lighten your hand so that you do not go down to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in the others, and I will speak of it elsewhere; and the cauteries on the corners must be more subtle than those used in the middle of the head, and this is the method:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes in one part of the head and the disease extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other treatments mentioned in the division of diseases are applied, and none of this helps: then make cauteries in two ways, namely with sharp medicine and with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is made by taking a clove of garlic, removing the peel, and cutting it a little at both ends, then cutting the temple where the pain is so that you can insert the clove of garlic under the skin; when it is inserted, bind and press it well and leave it for twelve hours; then untie it and remove the clove of garlic, and leave the wound like this for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the rot comes out.
Afterward, treat the wound with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is done in this manner. Heat the cautery which has this shape:
It is called "clos" because the head is shaped like a nail with a slight curve, and in the middle, it has a small protrusion; place it on the painful spot, hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the core is burned; then lift your hand so that the artery above does not burn, and a lot of blood flows.
Afterward, apply cotton soaked in salt water to the spot for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the spot with ointment until it is healed; and if you want, cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare", with the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have mentioned before in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned, both with medicine and iron, are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white-hot; and bleed first on the painful spot a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery and not to reach the bone; and beware of the jaw that moves when eating, and the nerves should not be affected so that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the bleeding from the artery when it is cut, or cutting is very dangerous, especially for those who do not know about it and who are not studied and experienced; and stop the procedure midway; but I will tell you how to stop the bleeding when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not sufficient for the disease, and the patient is suffering, cauterize the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed; and if you wish, apply the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on artery extraction, with the cautery that has two knives; and this cautery is better and more helpful than the other.
of the pain in the ears due to cold
When cold-induced pain comes in the ear, and purgative medicines and other treatments mentioned in the division have been applied, and the pain does not move, then heat this cautery called "poins", which has this shape:
Then prick all around the affected ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and distance yourself a little above the root of the ear once you have marked the spot with ink; and make ten pricks around each ear; afterward treat the spot until it is healed.
of the distortion of the mouth
A condition that must be treated by cautery is only those that arise from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases; and do not make a cautery for those that come from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this type of condition that comes from phlegm with purgatives and gargles for the head, and this does not help, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the other a little above the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips; and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and make a cautery at the top of the ear a little below the corner of the head, and another at the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery on until half of the core is burned; and this is the shape of the cautery:
It is similar to the "cultellare" that we mentioned before, but it is a bit more subtle and the blade should be a bit thicker; afterward treat the spot as I mentioned before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two corners of the head, one in the middle of the head, and one in the place called "vasselz" as we mentioned before, and the last cautery above the mouth of the stomach; and treat it as we mentioned before.
of lethargy
For this disease, it is necessary to give the patient strong purgatives and pills that cleanse the brain; afterward, shave the patient's entire head, and place on the occiput the mustard plaster that is described in the treatise on plasters; and this is the manner of the cautery: do it as I have said.
If he is healed this way, it is good; and if not, make three cauteries from the middle of the head down to the neck, spaced a finger's width apart; and treat them as the others, and if you want to add more, and the patient is enduring, make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two more on the two corners, and treat until healed; and use the cautery called "olivare", as I have said before.
of the coldness of the head It is necessary that the head be cleansed with purgatives and what we have mentioned before; afterward shave the patient's head, then make a cautery in the middle of the head and on each corner, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck; and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is enduring, and the disease is strong, make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the core is burned, then lift your hand; afterward treat until healed, and use the cautery called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
Epileptics should not use cautery except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain with purgatives and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is grown and enduring enough to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, make gargles and chewing that cleanse the brain often with good foods; afterward shave the head in the middle, and make a cautery as we have said before, and one cautery on the vessel, and on each corner; and if the patient is strong and enduring, make cauteries as I said for those with paralysis and weakening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped as I have said.
If the patient is a child, make a subtle cautery in this manner:
When because of melancholy the superfluities or moisture are corrupted and thick phlegm, then cauterize with such cauteries as we have said for those with paralysis.
And if because of melancholy the superfluities decline to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him something to drink that will cleanse the brain, as we have said before in the division.
Afterward shave the patient's head; then make a ring of linen well made, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head; and let the patient sit cross-legged and be well held on all sides; then present the liniment, and it is very effective with old sheep butter; and heat it gently over the fire, so that the finger can endure it when dipped; then pour the circle inside the middle of the head, and let it cool; and do this to the patient once a week with other good management, until he is healed.
Or if you want, cauterize by making multiple pricks with the cautery. This manner of cautery moistens the brain evenly; and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
of the wateriness of the eyes When water first comes to the eyes by the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to drink that will cleanse the head, and keep him away from all moistures, and make him sweat or bathe several times while fasting.
Afterward command him to shave his head, and make a cautery in the middle of the head, and make two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of the water is in both eyes together, or in one if the descent is in one; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the core, and let the cauteries be long according to the width of the temple; and beware of bleeding, and if you see too much blood flowing, then stop it with whatever power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision how you will stop it; and sometimes a cautery is made in the hinder part below the two bones at the back.
of the flow of tears
When the tears from the eyes are old and habitual and are on the veins, or next to the arteries that are on the outward appearance of the head; and it is seen that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then make the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries in the hinder part below the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize lightly above the eyebrow with a small cautery.
of the flow of tears within the eyes
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient something to drink for three nights; afterward shave the head, and make a cautery in the middle with the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" on the two eyebrows, a little below the hair; and be careful not to cut the artery. And this is the shape of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by disease and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery called "olivare". of which this is the shape:
And if you want, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are; and do not leave the hand there except just long enough for the third part of the eyelid to be burned, according to the manner that I have said.
of the hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes turn inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are applied in two ways: either with fire or with burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, place the patient on your lap; then mark on the eyelid a figure like a myrtle leaf, with the beginning of the mark near the hairs; then apply cotton soaked in egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery of which this is the shape:
Afterward, cauterize over the marked figure gently many times, so that the core is burned in that area; the sign of successful work is that you see the eyelid retract and the hairs lift from the eye's surface; then lift your hand, and leave it for three days, then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone; afterward treat with ointment until healed.
And if after this the hairs come back and the eyelid is softened, then restart the cautery on the same spot as you did first; and if the hairs are outside, cauterize until the eyelid is lifted to its natural place, and is even, so the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery with burning medicine requires instructing the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then making a shape like a myrtle leaf out of parchment; then take French soap and quicklime, each one ounce, and grind them together well; do it quickly so it doesn't cool, then spread it on the parchment shaped like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid; and if the disease is in one eye, work on one, or both if in both; place cotton soaked in egg white below the eye; and let the patient's head be on your lap and place your index finger on the medicine, pressing gently and moving it whenever the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, as it feels like fire. When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, wash the area with water, and check if you see the eyelid lifted as if by fire or incision; if so, it is good. If not, reapply the medicine on the spot where it has not worked, until your work is even and the eyes are aligned; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burned core falls off, afterward treat the area with ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary to be very careful in your work so that no medicine falls into the eyes. And if the eyelid becomes soft again and the hairs prick the eye, restart the medicine on the softened spot of the eyelid exactly as you did before; afterward treat until it is healed; and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes vary in size and shape, and adjust your treatment accordingly; and the correct method should not be revealed to anyone not dedicated to this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not work, then you must cauterize it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head on your lap; and have an assistant hold his head between his hands so it does not move; then place cotton soaked in egg white or parsley juice on the eye; afterward heat the cautery which is shaped like the quill of a vulture, with the cautery at the end; if you wish, it can be pointed from one end to the other, or it can be shaped like a tent; but in any case, the quill-shaped one is very useful for your work.
Afterward press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus and dry it; if it is closed, open it and remove the pus; then apply the hot cautery strongly, holding your hand steady over the fistula on the upper part of the eye, so your hand does not slip; place the cautery in the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If you reach the bone with the cautery, it would be good. If not, repeat the cautery again, and again if needed, and leave it for three days; afterward apply cotton soaked in butter, and treat with drying ointment until healed; and if forty days pass without healing, apply sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and shave it according to what is mentioned in its chapter.
There is a method of cauterizing a fistula that some of the ancients mentioned. Open the fistula, and split the place; afterward place a small chamomile flower in the split, of which this is the shape: and make it to the size of one ounce of lead; and hold your hand firmly on the chamomile, and do not let the patient move, so that the melted lead does not flow into his eye; and it is necessary to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the eye: the lead burns the fistula and heals it marvelously.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery we mentioned, it is good. If not, it is necessary to administer punctures to the nerve, and bring the fistula to the core of the nerve as needed in its proper place.
of the cracks in the lips Many times cracks appear in the lips that are called "poil", especially in children's lips.
When you treat these cracks as we have mentioned in the divisions, and the treatment does not help, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery in this shape:
And quickly place it in the cracks until it reaches the bottom; afterward treat the area with wax until it is healed.
of the abscess in the throat
When an abscess forms at the root of the throat or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, it becomes putrid, round, old, and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help: then you must have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; afterward, place it on the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the back of the place; do this once or twice, afterward treat it with what we have mentioned in treatments, until it is healed; and if it is healed this way, it is good; if not, it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
of the movement of the teeth
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth become loose, and you treat it with medicines and it does not help, then place the patient's head on your lap; afterward heat the cautery whose shape will be mentioned later in such a way that you place a ring on the tooth; and place the hot cautery inside quickly, and hold it until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth; afterward lift your hand and repeat the cautery as you wish; afterward, have the patient fill his mouth with salt water, and hold it for an hour and spit it out.
And in this way, the loose tooth will be firm, the softened gums will be strengthened, and the corrupted moisture will be dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is cold or wind, and the medicine treatments do not help, then a cautery is needed in two ways: with butter or with fire.
The butter cautery is done by taking cow's butter and melting it in an iron or brass spoon; then take cotton and wrap it on the tip of a stick, soak it in the melted butter, and apply it quickly to the aching tooth and hold it until it cools; do this often until the effect reaches the root of the tooth, and if you want, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place a hot iron on it until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
The fire cautery is done by taking an iron or brass ring, and making it large enough so the fire does not reach the patient's mouth; afterward heat the cautery, whose shape will be mentioned later, and place it on the tooth and hold it until the cautery cools; do this often, for the pain will be removed that same day or the next. And the patient should fill his mouth with good butter during the application of the cautery, and then spit it out; and this is the shape of the cautery:
When scrofula is caused by phlegm and cold moisture, and does not respond to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery whose shape will be mentioned later, and it should have two openings for the fumes to escape on the other side; and apply the hot cautery on the abscess once, or twice if needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess; and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is gone; afterward treat the area with ointments and bandages until healed. The shape of the ring:
When moisture prevails over the channels of the lung, especially when it comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be emptied by purgative medicines; afterward make a cautery at the root of the throat, and be careful not to go down to the throat, and burn only a little of the core. Afterward make another cautery at the junction of the neck to the top of the spine, and let the cautery be called "clavile" whose shape we mentioned earlier; and treat the area as we mentioned earlier until healed.
of the cough When cough and lung disease are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the disease is old, make two cauteries on the chest in empty places; and one cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts; and let the cautery be called "clavile" according to the shape mentioned earlier.
And if you want, make a cautery by pricking with the cautery called "poins" whose shape is mentioned earlier in the disease of the ears; and make up to thirty pricks, or around that number. Afterward treat the area as mentioned earlier, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this shape:
And for this reason, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at once.
of the dislocation of the shoulder When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterward, the patient should be laid on his back and side; then lift the core within the titillate with the fingers of your left hand; and if the joint is dislocated inward, heat the cautery with two nerves of which this is the shape:
and cauterize the core until it penetrates to the ribs, and the shape of the cautery will come with four cauteries; and therefore a cautery is made with the cautery that has three nerves, so the shape of the cauterization will be six cauteries; and the nerves are according to the subtlety of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery with three nerves:
Sometimes an additional nerve is added, making it eight cauteries.
Afterward, apply mashed leeks with salt on the cautery; then let the patient rest, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well strengthened.
If it is dislocated upward, which rarely happens, then make a cautery on the thickness of the clavicle cautery, or many small cauteries. This will close the joint, remove the moisture, and the patient will be healed.
of the cautery for pleurisy
The ancients said that one should make cauteries for pleurisy with roots of aristolochia, in this manner: take a long root of aristolochia, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and as thick and as long as your fingers; soak it in oil, and put it over the fire, then cauterize one cautery between the shoulder blade and the neck, and two small cauteries descending a little in the area below the beard; two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, declining slightly backward; one cautery in the middle of the chest, another on the stomach, one between the two shoulders, and two on the sides of the chest near the cautery between the two shoulders; and do not press your hand, rather make it openly as if you were smelling.
And some ancients said that some use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess; the pain jumps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver. But in this work, there is a fear that the patient may die immediately, or a fistula may form that cannot be healed.
of the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen as we have mentioned in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three ways of cautery that are all good.
One method is to make three or four cauteries in a line along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cautery we mentioned earlier; do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient lie on his back;
Another method of cautery is to heat the cautery with two nerves, as we showed in the dislocation of the shoulder; lift the core that is at the spleen, where the patient's ribs come on the left side, and the elevation where you lift the core should be along the length of the body, and the cauteries should be along the width of the body.
Then insert the two burning nerves until the core is pierced on the other side, and then remove the cautery, and there will be four. And if you wish, cauterize with the cautery with three nerves. Afterward, treat when it has expelled pus for a long time, and this is much better than the other treatments mentioned earlier.
of dropsy (edema)
Cautery is not effective for dropsy except in the manner called "ascites". When you treat it according to the methods we mentioned in the divisions, and your treatment does not help, then you must make four cauteries around the navel, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two on the back over the spine, and one on the chest; and let the cauteries be close to the thickness of the core.
Afterward, leave the cautery open to expel pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery; healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will come together with the help of God.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the clavile that we showed earlier; and the one for the back should be olive-shaped, as mentioned earlier.
of the swelling of the feet When the feet are swollen in a dropsical person, and are full of citrine water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without turning. Do not go too deep, so the citrine water can flow out, and let the cautery be in this shape:
Then make two cauteries on each leg with the point of the knife-shaped cautery; let the cautery be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg; and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so the water can flow out; afterward treat with the other treatments we mentioned.
of menstruation
When there is a bowel disorder due to cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive faculties in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and it cannot be treated by usual methods; and you see the patient enduring and of strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach as mentioned earlier with the circular cautery; and four small cauteries around the navel with a subtle clavile cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient is enduring, make a cautery on the wrist, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries on the stomach near the large one, because the treatment is effective when there is good help.
of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and of thick, cold, and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we mentioned in the divisions, and it does not help, then make cauteries: three on the spine, the one furthest below the shoulder blades little by little in a triangle, and one cautery below the navel, two fingers' width;
and if you think his stomach is cooled, and the food does not digest, and the face is seen to swell, then make a large cautery on the stomach as mentioned before, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the clavile cautery; and leave the cautery open for a long time. Afterward treat the area until it is healed.
of the fleshiness that is called "thelul"
When you cut the "thelul", heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then place it completely hot on the cut "thelul"; and leave your hand there until the cautery reaches the origin of the vein, from which the blood flows; do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of "thelul", cauterize each as we have said; afterward treat with beneficial ointments until healed; and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the "thelul", it will be more helpful.
of a poorly healed wound
When the patient cannot endure cutting or opening, as we will recount in its place, then comes such a disease that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula forms and becomes old, discharging pus and corrupted moisture, probe it with a thin tent, and ensure you know the depth with the tent. Afterward, heat the cautery resembling a razor, and place it in the fistula according to the depth the tent reached, and repeat the cautery until the rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed; and beware of burning the nerves and large veins. If the fistula goes to the bladder or intestines, avoid these areas, and only do this in fleshy areas, ensuring it does not perforate; afterward treat the area until healed, and if the area is sealed and the matter removed for a long time, then know the area is entirely healed; if not, know the area is troubled, and the bone is corrupted at the base; and like one of these that we will mention in its place.
of kidney disease When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from thick winds, and he has no desire for women, then make a cautery on the kidneys on both sides with the clavile cautery as mentioned earlier; and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be three cauteries in a line, which will be more helpful.
of the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, causing the patient to retain urine, make a cautery on the front part over the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, one on the right and one on the left, each cautery as long as the width of a thumb; make one cautery on the back, or two if needed; and let the cauteries be clavile according to the shape mentioned earlier.
of the uterus When the womb is cold and moist, not preventing conception, and the menses are corrupted and their periods are delayed; and when they come, great pain is felt: then make three cauteries around the navel, as mentioned in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries on the back; and let the cauteries be clavile, as mentioned.
of the hip
When viscous moisture descends to the hip joint, causing it to dislocate, and the sign is that one thigh is longer than the other when measured together; and the location of the dislocation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip joint with a circular cautery, and bleed in front of the location around the joint so that the joint is within the circle; and let the cautery be like the one used for the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cautery be as deep as the entire core; and treat it until it is healed.
of the hip pain When pain comes to the hip joint, caused by cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division and the treatment does not work, and the disease is old: then you must purge the patient of the thick humors with fetid pills or other good pills.
Afterward make the cautery; and the manner of the cautery is according to two ways: with burning medicines, and fire cautery. Fire cautery is done in many ways, one of which is: cauterize on the hip joint with three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make them deep and large, with a space between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cautery be olive-shaped; sometimes a cautery is made in the middle on the head of the hip, so there are four according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize with the circular cautery mentioned earlier for the dislocation of the hip; but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and the entire thickness of the core is burned.
And this is the manner done for sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or leg. If it reaches the thigh and leg, make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers wide, a little to the left; and let the cautery be knife-shaped, and burn the thickness of the core; and if the patient feels the pain extends to the toes or near there, cauterize where the pain is felt with three or four pricks with the cautery called "poins".
And if necessary, make more; if the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with the knife-shaped or circular cautery, and be very careful with all your cauteries not to leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, causing the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who made cautery on the ankle of the foot and left it so long that the leg was entirely swollen, and the foot too, and the foot was pierced and corrupted. Afterward a bowel disorder from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, make a cautery on each, in this manner. The wise said for the hip cautery, whose manner is this: make such an iron tool and let it be at the head as thick as a date stone, or a little less, and let it be interlaced, with a space between each interlace the size of a knuckle; and let the interlaces be open on two sides, and be like knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle; and this is the shape:
And heat it until it is all red and sparks, then place it on the diseased hip joint, and turn it on the healthy side; and cauterize once with a round cautery and leave it for three days; then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; afterward treat with ointment until healed.
Albucasim said that we use little of this cautery due to the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it; however, it is a good cautery, for those who can endure it, and where it is appropriate.
of back pain
When pain comes to the back, either from falling or impact or excessive evacuation, or from the spread of cold matter, cautery is useful for none of these cases, except for one caused by the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary that after the patient is purged with fetid pills or similar, three lines be made on his back where the pain is, marked with ink, and in each line five cauteries or more according to the strength and capacity of the patient; and let the cautery be done with the cautery called "poins"; and if you wish, make three or four cauteries with the medium clavile cautery in this shape:
Many times this disease comes to small children, and the sign of its onset is that they have labored breathing when they get up, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in us the appearance that comes on the other spines.
When you see this and want to treat it, cauterize it with the circular cautery in this shape:
So that the cautery takes each part of the spine equally. And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with pricking cautery in two or three lines, and let the pricks be close to each other. Afterward, treat the area until it is healed as we said, and be careful not to administer cautery on gibbosity that is in a nerve spasm.
of joint pain
When joint pain is from moisture that is spread to each part of the body, and when pain comes to the feet, which doctors properly call "podagra", and when it is from a cold cause and medical treatments cannot cure it, it is cured by cautery in this manner: make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped in this shape:
And if it is necessary to prick the face of the foot, make a cautery with the cautery called "point". And if the pains come to the knees and other joints, which happens many times, make cautery on each knee with three or four cauteries on each part, with the olive-shaped cautery; and if you need more, make more, but do not leave your hand there longer than necessary to burn the thickness of the core.
And if the pains descend to the knees and the back, administer the cautery we mentioned in its chapter. And if the pains are in the hands, make pricks around the joint in two lines; and if there is still pain in the fingers, make pricks on each joint and on the back of the hand; and if the pains come to the elbows or shoulders, cauterize each part, and govern the patient well and give medicines. For if you govern well and purge phlegm, the patient will be healed with God's help.
of rupture of the scrotum
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines descend into the scrotum and it is new, it is necessary that when you want to cure it, he should not eat that day; and he should use things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his stomach; then make him sit on his back between your hands, and command him to hold his breath until the intestines are repositioned, and return them with your fingers, and bleed underneath the rupture on the pubic bone, and make a sign that resembles half a circle above the body; then heat the cautery, the form of which is:
until it is white and sparks. Then reposition the intestines to their place; the assistant holds his hand on them to prevent them from returning; and work well on the patient's thighs, and place a cushion under him and an assistant on the thighs, and another on the chest to hold his hands; then place the cautery on the sign with your whole hand, hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, repeat again until you reach the bone; and be careful that the intestines do not come out when you apply the cautery; do not burn them; and ensure the patient does not die from this, or other harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing. It is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle according to the measure of their bones, and for adults as large according to their measure; after three days, treat the cautery site with butter until the burn is gone; afterward treat with other ointments until healed, and the patient should lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well healed; and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that the intestines do not come out when he gets up to go to the room.
And after forty days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and wear it for another forty days; he should have good rest, work little and avoid too much food and drink, and shouting too loudly; and when he follows this advice he will be completely healed. And I will later describe the cure by cutting in its chapter. of rupture of the abdomen
When ruptures come in other parts of the abdomen and are known, and you want them not to grow more, make one cautery with a round cautery according to its quantity, and burn a third of the core; afterward treat as we have said; and some of the ancients said it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery in this shape:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the rupture, and another above, and place your hand in the middle with the clavile cautery. But the first cautery is easier and better.
of chronic pain in any limb When pain comes to any member, either from falling or injury, and this pain lasts a long time, and medical cures do not work, then it must be cauterized with the cautery called "poins", and let the cautery be according to the length of the member and its smallness, its weakness, its strength, and its location of twists and pain. If healed by the first cautery, it is good; if not, repeat another cautery on the same spot, because such a habit is that it must be moved to the nearby member, for which it is necessary to make cauteries until the patient is healed.
of leprosy
Leprosy is sometimes greatly helped by cautery, especially the disease that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy. When you see it and want to cauterize, check if the disease is at the beginning, and if it is treated as we have said in the division, and it does not go down or stay, and you fear that the corruption will affect the whole patient, then make five cauteries on the head: one in the middle of the head at the top, and the other toward the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two horns, and one behind on the occiput; and leave your hand there long enough for the cautery to reach the bone, and for the scabs to come off so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape; and cauterize the spleen according to what was said before.
And if the leprosy is spread everywhere; and it is clearly visible, it is necessary to cauterize it with those cauteries we mentioned on the head, and one cautery on the top of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another next to it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands; and be careful not to burn the nerves that are on the backside, and sometimes make a cautery on the pubic bone, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more you help, and the more it benefits; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery as the healthy do, because the body is already entirely corrupted. And the cauteries must be large and small according to the members and joints, as you will find in the manner of the tools. Afterward, treat the area with vetch flour with honey and other treatments until it is healed.
of swelling
When swelling comes to any member and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the member according to the size and smallness of the member; and let the cautery be a little penetrating into the thickness of the core; then treat with ointments until healed. And sometimes a cautery is made on the hand and foot and back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the member, and thus the swelling is removed; and nevertheless, no one should undertake this if they do not know the members and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
of white spots
When the disease called "albaras" is old, and the medical treatments do not work, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deep, according to the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is removed, and the color is changed; then treat with vetch flour and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and the blood of a dove and the blood of a lizard, each a part; and mix it all together, and bind it with a cloth, and air it at the place until it is healed.
the treatment of chancre by cautery
When a chancre comes at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the chancre.  And yet the wise said that one should make a cautery also in the middle of the chancre; and yet this does not seem good to me, because I fear it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have seen this happen sometimes; and a more proper thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circule", as we have said in many cauteries.
Of the swelling that cannot mature
When someone has a disease called "adubelati", and it takes a long time to ripen either because of the excess it produces or because of the patient's age when he is decrepit (which means too old) and has little blood, or because of the time; and you want to hasten it to ripen: then cauterize around it with many small pricking cauteries; afterward, leave it like this. Because it will hasten to ripen.
And if you want to pierce it with the cautery, heat the cautery, the form of which is:
And place your hand in the middle of this disease called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it outside in such a way that the flow of the putrid matter is eased. Afterward, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
The treatment of fire by iron
Another type of disease there is called "corrodens", and it is nothing other than an eating away of a member, because it eats the members like fire eats dry wood. If you see this disease in a place that can suffer cautery with fire, then heat the clavile cauteries, both small and large, according to what is needed for the place where the disease is; afterward, cauterize it on all sides until you remove all the corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that everything that is corrupted is removed. And then leave it for three days, and put on the cauterized places ground sulfur with oil until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption. Afterward, treat with ointments that generate flesh.  And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, it is good; and if not, repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places. And this eating away has sometimes been cured with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery; but nevertheless, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already said the cure of sharp medicine in the division: take it when you need it.
Of the corns that come on the feet
Many times it happens that on the upper side of the feet a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and it is a large callous thing that hurts the foot. And the cautery for this disease is in two ways. These are cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water. Fire cautery is when you heat a pointed cautery like a quill pen, made of good iron to the measure that it can surround the callus on all sides, with subtle edges; then place it very hot on the callus, and turn your hand all around the callus until it comes to the root of the callus; and leave it like this for three days until it starts to discharge pus; then make a plaster of wild mallows ground with salt, and leave the plaster on all night, and the callus will fall and be uprooted from its roots. Then treat the area with an ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if they are on the upper part of the body, and this often happens on hands and feet, then it is necessary to administer hot water cautery; and it is in this way: take a tube of brass or iron, or a quill pen, and place it on the callus and the wart, which is called porrelz verrues; place the tube so that it surrounds it all around, then put a little hot water in it, and hold your hand well, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the tube reaches the root of the callus, and the hot water can find a deep path to the root; and the patient should endure the biting of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like this, and it will uproot itself completely with all its roots. Do this one after another until you have uprooted all those on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
The treatment of trembling
When someone trembles from the coldness of the nerves, or from quartan fever or another, it is necessary to make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the foot, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery; this will stop the trembling, and hasten the recovery from the cold disease.
Of the foul-smelling pustules
Sometimes, stinking pustules appear on the surface of the body, which come from large corrupted matters. It is necessary at first, when they appear, to make a cautery on the head of each pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, with the point heated in fire, or of the long root of aristolochia, or with the lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow from then on, but the excess from which they come is disrupted, and they are healed; but it is necessary that this be done after blood evacuation.
When the artery is cut Many times it happens that there are great flows of blood from the artery that is cut at the wound that comes from outside, or from the incision of the abscess, or from the cautery of the member, and similar things; and it is very difficult to stop.
And nevertheless when this happens to someone, hurry to put your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press hard enough that the blood calms under your finger, and no drop comes out; then put several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire until they are all red; then take one, either large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cautery on that vein where you are holding your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is staunched.
And if it spurts out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery goes out, then hastily take another one of the cauteries that are in the fire.
And do not stop doing this one after another until the blood is staunched; and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient; and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well staunched especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways we have mentioned: either by cautery, or by extraction when it is not pulled, or by strong tying with thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to staunch blood; and let it be tied and pressed appropriately.
Whoever administers stanching by tightly tying with cloths or applying burning things, or other similar things, will find it helps but little.
And if this happens to someone and he has neither doctor nor medicine present, he must put his index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and press hard enough that it is staunched over the wound and over the vein; and not move his finger, but moisten it often with cold water that is very cold until the blood is frozen and thickened and staunched; and afterward do whatever is necessary with cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all about diseases that require fire cautery or burning medicine, and the indications, causes, instruments, and forms of cauteries; and I have covered this chapter from head to toe, and I will proceed in this chapter in the same way so that one can find more easily what they seek.
And before I begin, it is necessary, dear son, for you to learn that in this chapter there is more danger and fear than in the first on cauteries, and therefore it requires greater caution.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many types of people come for treatments. Some come who are so afflicted with their illness that they die quickly because of the madness they find in their illness, and from the severity of their malice; and one must be wary of these. And there are those who give you their opinion and say: "Wait, I am cured"; but the illness is treacherous. It is not right for you to consent to those who come to you with this manner, but place greater consideration on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely on that of which you are certain, and from which you can gain profit and praise; and use prognosis and indication in the treatments of your patients to which health may be converted; and this will help you acquire a good reputation, glory, and a memory of praise.
Very dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have arranged this chapter for you by dividing it into chapters, according to what is in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to toe, so that you may more easily find what you need.
About the head full of water
Know that this illness often comes to children at birth, when the delivery process compresses the child's head too strongly; and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this illness except in children, and in all those I have seen, death hastened; and therefore it seems to me that it is better to leave the work of such treatments.
And I saw one child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled every day until it could no longer be supported; and the moisture grew so much that the child died, and this moisture is gathered beneath the bone above the brain, between the brain and the bone; and the procedure is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the abscess is small, you make a wide incision in the middle of the head; and it should be as long as two nuts, so that the moisture flows; and here is the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is greater, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions in the form of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs are that you see the sutures of the head opened on each side, and the water jumps out when you press it with your hand inside, and this is not answered: you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, draw out all the moisture. Then press the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it until the fifth day; then uncover it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head be pressed evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limbs are strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to look where the size of the abscess and the gathering of the water appears; for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Then cut where the abscess appears, and the filling of the water, and make the incision as you have the ability; and be careful not to cut the artery; and let the blood flow, so that the patient does not die from the outflow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
About rheum
When someone has an illness called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is chronic, and medical treatments do not help, then the last resort is cautery along with cutting the two arteries.
Therefore, when you want to cut them, have the patient tilt their head back; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens their neck with a cloth; then observe where the veins pulse, and the locations of both are behind the ears, and they are slightly hidden; then mark the locations, and cut both with a sharp two-edged spatula, so that the cut reaches the bone, and this should be done across the width of the head.
And if you want, place the spatula under the artery and cut it from above, cutting as if two fingers width across.
And when the vein is cut, the blood will continuously spurt out upwards.
And if the artery does not appear by feeling, then you must measure the amount of three fingers width, then mark and cut to the bone; and the amount of blood that must be let out is six cups, possibly a little more or less, according to what the patient can bear, and the fullness of the artery; then look at the wound: if there remains a point on the bone, cut it so that a hot abscess does not form, then press the wound and bandage it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
About migraine
When a chronic migraine occurs, and acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and heat in the temples and an old persistent headache and similar things, and it is treated by medical treatments and none of it helps, then we extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have explained.
And the manner of their extraction is that the patient pulls back the hair of his temples, and feels for the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears well by its beating, and is slightly hidden except in some men who are very cold; and if it is hidden, then the patient tightens his neck with some cloths, then rubs the area with some rough cloth, and sprinkles the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatula, which is of this form:
then lightly cut the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it up with pincers, and separate it well from the tissues that are beneath it on each side; and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of a hook, then cut it from that part according to the amount of the two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood does not spurt out completely.
And draw out six cups of blood, up to three; and if the artery is large, then you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no rot comes before the healing of the wound, and the flow of blood stops; then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that very hour, and then, if you want, cauterize it with a knife cautery to the bone until the heads are cut; and this is the best procedure, if the patient does not have a fever and he is of a hot complexion.
For the cautery helps to end the moisture: therefore it is of greater help for the moisture. Or, for the extraction of the arteries, one must fill the area with old cotton and place well-made tents on top; and when you untie them, treat them with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with tents, until it is healed; and if blood runs from the artery while you are working, quickly stop it with cautery, or fill the area with vitriol and press it with your hand so that the blood stops; and if you do not have this on hand, place your finger on the spot until the blood clots, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the blood stops, and press as necessary; and the best and easiest method for extracting the artery is to cauterize the vein with a cutting cautery on both sides, but the cuts should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less. And there should be a finger's width of thickness between the two knives, and then when you have marked the two spots, place the burning iron on them until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and let there be a distance between the two heads because it is not entirely closed by this cautery; and this is the form of the cautery:
About tears
When tears from the eyes descend from the veins on the top of the head outward, and medical treatments do not help, and you see the patient's face redden, and he feels a throbbing in the forehead as if from chills; and his eyes are thin and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids fall out, and the eyelids are heated and scraped by the burning of the tears, then there is need for this treatment.
And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it involves having the patient with this disease pull back any hair on their forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead evenly along the length of the forehead; one of the incisions should be like two fingers in the middle of the forehead, running down to the nose, and the other two at the sides above the eyelids, and be careful of the incision of the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids; and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jawbones, and each wound should be three fingers wide across joined together;
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two cuts along with the tissue that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula.
then place in the first cut the instrument that is called "knife-like," and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side it is smooth, not sharp, and this is the form: And place the cutting side towards the flesh up to the tissue, and the smooth side towards the bone, and place it until it reaches the middle cut. And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears from the tissue, and then do the same from the middle cut to the other outside; and then extract the blood evenly, and press the area for the clotted blood; then place in each cut a tent of old cotton, and place cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no hot abscess forms; and on the third day, untie the bandage, and administer a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments used for wounds, until it is healed.
About the rheum of the eyes
When someone frequently has acute catarrh, and you see the eyes thin and small, and the vision weakening, and the eyelids burnt; and the hairs fall out, and there is deep acute pain in the head, and the patient sneezes; then know by these symptoms that these materials and this catarrh come only from many veins, and the best treatment for this is as follows.
And it is that you command the patient to pull back his forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another one crosswise. And start from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move to the jaw; and when the bone is uncovered, wipe all the blood with a sponge, and then separate between the two lips of the incision and place old cotton and linen tents; then bind above with cloths soaked in wine and oil, and guard against hot abscess; when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh starts to grow there, then treat it with drying substances that make flesh grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flower and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to grow flesh everywhere.
About the blockage of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, or an insect, or a stone from a mine or similar thing like iron; or seeds, like barley, beans, peas; or flowing substances like water and vinegar and similar things.
When a stone or other type of thing falls into the ear that does not adhere to the ear and does not grow in the ear, place the ear in the sun. If you see the stone, then distill a little violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make the person sneeze with pepper, and plug the nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and hold the ear upwards. Often it comes out by this treatment; and if it does not come out, then administer extraction with delicate pincers, which have this form:
If it jumps out with pincers, that is good; if not, then administer extraction with a delicate hook of small size; and if it does not come out by this, then make a bronze tube and place the end of the tube in the ear hole tightly, and seal what is around the tube with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the tube; then pull it out strongly, for often it comes out as we have said; and if it does not come out in this manner, then take glue used for catching birds, and place it on an instrument that is suitable for this purpose, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it is, and pull it out. And if it does not come out by all these means that we have mentioned, then hurry to cut the ear before a hot abscess comes, and spasms; and the manner of the cut is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to his strength, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear upwards, and make a small cut at the root of the ear in the soft part at the dependent place; and let the cut be like a crescent, until you reach the stone, then remove it as best you can, and suck it quickly with your mouth; and treat it until it is healed. And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, then administer extraction; and if it cannot come out, then administer a thin, delicate spatula in this form:
and administer incision of the grain. But do not do this when you think that the grain is moist from the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces of it; then extract it with delicate pincers and by suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the case of water that falls into the ear, the patient must first sneeze with pepper, and fill the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that ear where the water is. If it comes out by this, that is good. If not, then take many small, thin, and light stones, and heat them a little in the fire; and the patient should place one in the hole of his ear, and jump on one of his feet on the other side, and strike another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not stop doing this stone by stone until the water comes out completely, and in this way it will all come out; and if you wish, then take a rush, and put one end in the ear, and light the other end with fire until most of the rush is burnt; then do the same with other rushes until the water comes out completely, as we have said about the stone.
In the extraction of an insect, if it is small-bodied, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division; but if it is large-bodied and can be felt, then administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms bred in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not help, then you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, then extract them with delicate pincers, and if they do not appear, then take a tube of which this is the form:
And let it be narrow below and wide above. And place the more delicate end in the ear according to the tolerance of the patient, then suck strongly on the tube; do this often until all the worms come out. And if they do not obey to come out, then seal around the tube with cotton as I have said about the stone; and if they do not come out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have proven for killing worms, and you will find them in the treatment of distillations; and distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, of which this is the form as you see:
And let it be of silver or bronze, narrow below with small holes, and open above for distillation; and to press the distillation inside, use a well-made bronze instrument for this, and if you wish, take a razor and wrap it suitably with cotton; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever you want of your medicines into the tube, and let the tube be in the ear; then place the razor with the cotton inside, and press your hand moderately until the oil is distilled to the bottom of the ear; and let the patient feel it inside, and let the distillation be a little warmed by fire before it is distilled into the ear; and make sure it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as good.
About the blockage of the ears
Some children are born who have no openings in their ears; and this same thing happens to men by blockage from a wound, or flesh growing inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep inside the ear, so it cannot be seen; and sometimes it happens a little outside the hole, and it can be easily seen.
So that which occurs deep inside, if it cannot be seen, is of difficult healing in many cases, and in that which can be seen, you must place the ear of the patient in the sun; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then work it with this spatula of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and back, so that it does not injure the ear; if the blockage is of grown flesh or body of the ear, then hold it with delicate pincers, and cut it lightly, until that flesh is all removed.
And if the blockage is deep in the ear, then take a light, delicate razor and heat it a little in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear. If you feel the blockage where the patient feels discomfort in hearing, pierce lightly, and make sure you do not injure the nerves of the ear; then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the hole, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment.
Do this for some days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it with rose water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol on it; and if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and place another tent moistened with wax made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then plunge a sponge and cloths into cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop bleeding which are in the treatment of distillations.
About the flesh of the eyelids
These swellings that come on the eyelids of the eyes when they are moist and then dry, you must stretch them with tongs and pincers, and cut them with a spatula at their roots; then place powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows from them, cauterize with a delicate lenticular cautery, and cauterizing after the incision is very effective; and many times they recur if any part of their roots remains; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burnt and do not return.
About hailstone-like formations
Many times things form on the eyelids that resemble hail in their shape and hardness, and because of this, the condition is called "hailstone," and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid; the procedure is as follows: check if the hailstone moves from one side to another, which is easy to determine; then make a wide incision, then scrape it lightly from each side, then take it with pincers and cut it. If you cannot cut it without piercing the eyelid a little, it does not harm the patient; and if the incision is large, then stitch it, and treat it until it is healed; and if it is small, do not force it, for the ointment will soon restore it and generate flesh.
And if the hailstone descends inside the ear towards the upper part, then turn the eyelid and stretch the hailstone with pincers, and cut and press it from one side to another; and if the eyelid is separated by the incision, it does not harm anything; and when the hailstone is cut, wash the eye with salted water, and treat the area with substances that generate flesh until the patient is healed.
About the fat of the eyes
Exinach is a fat that forms in the tissues of the upper eyelids, and this happens more in children than in adults, and it greatly troubles their eyes, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because the tears rush to their eyes; and because of this they lie on their faces often, and sleep on their faces, and their eyelids under their eyebrows are moist and the swelling and appearance are covered with exinach that appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the exinach in between.
And the manner of the procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap; then take a small linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the manner of a circle according to the amount that the exinach contains from each part, then place it on it; and press with your fingers from one side to another, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle; then cut in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a cut of the width, and it should not be larger than the wound made for bleeding a vein; and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in many cases, exinach comes out from the cut, in the form of a piece of white fat.
Then extract it with a piece of cloth placed between your fingers on the outside, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is expelled; and be careful not to press in the cut, so that you do not come with the spatula to the eye, and injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the cut, then increase the cut slightly until it appears; then extract it as we have said, then moisten cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are such men who grind salt and place it on to corrupt that moisture that remains. Then treat it until it is healed. And if a hot abscess comes to the area, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
About the hairs of the eyelids
When hairs other than the natural ones grow on the eyelids, and they are thick, they harm the eyes, and cause various diseases such as habitual tearing and softening of the eyelids and albugine, to the point that it causes the destruction of the eyes; and the treatment is according to four methods: either by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before in the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and suturing or by hooks, according to what I will say.
You must place the patientâ€™s head in your lap, then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand; if it is turned, that is good; if not, then place a needle with a thread on it; and let this be near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull a thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a razor; then cut on the lower part of the eyelid, below the added hairs, with the cutting spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one; then extract the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then mark on the eyelid a figure of an anchor, like a myrtle leaf, and the figure must be according to the quantity that you want to raise the eyelid which is described to all.
And there are some cases where it is necessary to cut a large amount of the eyelid according to how much the eyelid is softened; then cut with the spatula along the two lines that you have marked, and start from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the cuts be near the natural hairs with the thickness of a root, then place the hook in one of the two corners of the incision, then scrape it all; then join the two lips with a stitch of a needle with a fine wool thread, and wipe the blood, and burn the excess threads above the two eyebrows with some sticky substances, if you wish to do this; if not, do not worry about it, then leave the stitch and the threads for three or four days; then treat the wound without stitching with drying and constricting substances, for the eyelid rises with the healing of the wound and its joining, but the stitch is better (as the ancients said), and it is a procedure without fear.
and there is another method: and it is that you mark the eyelid with a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, as we have explained, with three separated hooks according to the form that is here:
then cut what exceeds with small scissors evenly according to the form that is here:
And if you cannot hold the pincers, and the thing is not even, then take a needle with a thread, and place it in the middle of the figure; and place another thread near the large tear duct, and the second thread near the small one, and gather the threads evenly between your fingers; then raise your hand evenly, and lift all the skin that you have marked, as we have explained, then join the two lips of the wound by stitching, and treat it until it is healed; and if an abscess comes to your incision, then soothe it with wax and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelid are inverted: then you must use what we have said about the incision; but the stitching in both is more artificial.
The treatment with hooks is according to this form: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut inside according to what I have said, and then make two hooks by art, and two delicate threads as long as the eyelid and the width of the spatula is; and cut the two ends on two sides where you hold the threads; then join them both subtly above what exceeds the eyelid of the eye, and press the two hooks from both sides strongly; and leave it like this for some days, and the skin that is pressed will die and blacken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with small scissors, then treat it until it is healed; and when the wound is healed, and the eyelid is lifted, and the hairs will not prick anymore; and this is the form of the two hooks that you will make according to this figure, and according to this length and width:
the procedure is such that you take a delicate needle, and place a soft and delicate silk thread in it; then join the ends and tie them both subtly, and let the length of the threads be a palm in length; then prepare in the loop another delicate silk thread shortly, and tie the ends of the thread; then let the patient place his head in your lap; and let it be near the sunlight so that the procedure is illuminated, for it is a delicate and fine procedure, then place the needle with the loop in the root of the added hair, and make it pierce the eyelid quickly until you pull it above the natural hair; then pull the hair up to the loop, and place in the loop that hair, if there are one or two or three or more; then pull your hand so that the hairs come out with the loop in the eyelid with the natural hair.
And if the loop is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, then you will pull the loop downwards with the thread that you have prepared in it, until the loop comes out from the hole above and you see it with the eye; then you will pull the loop and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hairs are attached to their place and flesh grows over them; and if the hairs are small, then accompany them with a long hair from the natural hair, and let it be raised with it or leave it, until it is extended and then lift it.
About the rot of the eye
When this disease called "aleacrati" or rot comes to the eye, there are two types: one natural, and the other unnatural. And it occurs by the healing of a wound, or by cutting or cautery, and by similar things.
And the manner of the procedure is that you cut that adhesion, and separate the lips of it, and place linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed; and you must not use in the treatment of it any drying and constricting substances. For if you do this, the disease will return worse than before; but treat it with softening substances, such as fenugreek; and sprinkle it with water or mallow and linseed cooked, and dyacylon ointment melted in some oils, and wrap a tent in it, and treat it with this.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you take care that it does not heal in the same form as before; and this procedure that we have mentioned is only for addressing this disease, so that it does not return in the same form as before.
About the flesh that comes in the eye
This disease which is beneath, truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental. The accident comes from a wound and a cut and a cautery and similar things; and the way to proceed in this is that you take a needle, with a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes in two ends of the flesh; then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good; if not, then take a razor and place it in the cut, and turn the eyelid, and make two cuts on the inside of the eyelid; and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two corners of the incision that you have made, and let it form an angle so that when they are joined, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "gamma"; then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharpened below, from what follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a wool thread; then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and tents, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a cut or a stitch or a cautery, then you must make a full cut below the hairs of the eyelids, and according to what is mentioned before; then separate between the two lips with a tent, as I have said; and the procedure must be done according to the shape of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares the best method of his ability to return the shape to its natural form; and the patient himself, according to what is necessary for the procedure and instruments in many cases.
About the adhesion of the eyelid
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a manner that the upper eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye, and it cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must place the point of a razor under the eyelid and lift it up; and stretch it with pincers until you cut what is sticking with a delicate spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient can endure it without the spatula injuring the eye; and make your incision lightly, so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape; and treat the entire adhesion by sometimes applying salt water to the eye, and washing it with fresh water and eyewash; then place a linen tent between the eyelid and the eye, and put wool moistened with egg white on the eye; and after the third day, use eyewash and healing substances until it is healed.
About the eye nail
Know that the eye nail (a growth on the eye) is of two types: one is nervous and resembles a hard surface, and another that is not nervous but resembles congealed white moisture, which when touched with iron or tried to be taken with pincers, cannot be grasped; and both types start near the large tear duct and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, all the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of the incision is that the patient places his head in your lap, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then take the nail with small pincers and stretch it above; then take a needle, and place a horsehair, or cow hair, or ox hair, and a strong thread; and bend the point of the needle a little and stick it into the nail, and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it above, and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil and the silk to the end, then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with the delicate spatula and small scissors, and leave the natural flesh at the tear duct, so that the usual flow of tears does not come from the incision; and sometimes the nail extends to the hook only, and the thread, as we have said; then scrape it with the soft spatula, which is of this form:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the fleshy tissue and tear it, and that the pupil is not pierced; and after the incision, throw a little ground salt into the eye, and eyewash made of litharge, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot place the needle, and the hook cannot enter, many times this type of nail is treated with medicines; and they grow as I have described in the division, and if you want to cut it, then open the patient's eye, and take the light, slightly sharp spatula, in this form:
And lift the nail delicately, and if you see that it diminishes to a point and the root approaches, then distill from your mouth into the eye eyewash made of litharge and red eyewash and ground salt, and cover the eye until the next day; then restart the procedure with this same work, until it is all removed.
If anything is not contrary in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it, and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then restart the procedure as before, until it is healed.
And if the appearance of the flesh of the tear duct greatly harms the eye, then suspend it with the hook, and cut a part of it but not all, so that the flow of tears does not come; then distill into the eye red eyewash made of litharge.
About the flesh that grows on the pupil
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows, and it covers the pupil and tightens on the eyelids and turns them outward, and it looks like a pomegranate flower; and the procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and gathers all that flesh with suitable hooks, and holds it with force; then cut the first flesh, and continue cutting with the razor until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the procedure; and let the incision be made with the spatula that we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and with small scissors, as shown in the form after this chapter;
and when the incision is completed and all the flesh is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt or distill red eyewash and similar corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white on the eye, so that it is protected from a hot abscess; and if anything remains, and hot blood rises, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with soothing substances for hot abscesses; then return to your procedure until it is healed, and do the same when flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
But always, you must adjust the treatment of each weak eye according to the natural way; and the accidental way, with the work of iron; and do not place your hand in any of these procedures until you see that the members can endure that procedure.
About the veins of the eyes
Sebel are red veins that are covered over the eye, and take away the vision and weaken the eye always. It is necessary first to see if the eye in which sebel is present is strong, and there is no other disease except sebel; then remove it in this manner: command the patient to place his head in your lap, then suspend those veins with the hook according to his wisdom, and let the hook be delicate and double according to this form:
And let there be two hooks by degrees in one body according to this form:
then take those veins with small forceps, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye; and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this procedure at noon before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything but those veins; and when you have done this, distill green and red eyewash into the eye to destroy what remains of the sebel.
And if you cannot gather all of it in that hour, then make a plaster on the eye with things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for some days until the pain is soothed and it is assured from a hot abscess, then restart according to this manner which is described before until it is healed; and this is the form of the forceps:
About the fistula of the eye
The doctors call it "arissati" fistula: when you treat it with cautery and sharp burning medicine as I have described before, and it is not healed, then the procedure is that you cut above the abscess, where it should heal, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is uncovered.
And when the bone is uncovered, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which this is the form; and it is called "rough head," and is made of Indian iron with one round head, and is pointed like a file as it is in the present form:
And place it on the area of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is scraped; and do this several times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
If the place is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and it remains so for forty days, and it does not renew and is not abscessed, and bad occurrences do not come, know that it is healed; if not, there is no other method but to return the fistula to the hole of the nose according to this form: and it is that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the head of the iron have three angles, and let the shaft be thin to the end as you see here:
Then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the air comes out if he holds his hand on his nose; and then restore the area with dry medicines, as I have instructed you, and when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the material will go to the nose; this is an easier thing for the patient.
About the prolapse of the eye
When the eye entirely prolapses and there is no disturbance to the nerves or reduction, you must bind the patient; then bleed them, then apply cupping glasses or suction cups without piercing to suck, then place a binding on the eye made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocol, and then compress the eye and apply a plaster with bands and cloths; and the manner of the cloths is that you take very soft cloths, fold each one into four, and then place one on top of the other according to the amount needed for the eye; then compress it firmly with a hard band, and repeat the cupping for suction without piercing; then remove the cups and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the binding softens, you must compress it again firmly; then remove the binding after a day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, that is good; if not, then restart the plaster, cloths, binding, and cupping until it is healed.
About the rupture of the uveal tissue
When ruptures occur in the uveal tissue, it becomes visible and protrudes from the eyelids like a grain of resin, which is frightening to see; then, if you want to cut it, the procedure is that you place a needle in the root from the lower part to the upper part, then place another needle with a double thread from the tear duct side; and make it pierce through, and leave the first needle in place; then cut the area with the double thread and tie a part of the uvea around, and compress it well, then remove the needle and place wool moistened with egg white on the eye; and leave it until the thread falls off with the uvea, then treat the eye with strengthening substances until the wound is healed; and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uvea on each side of a circle of cloth until it is healed.
And if the eye appears greatly, then pierce it with a delicate spatula that reaches the depth of the eye, and let the white moisture flow and the eye will descend, and immediately enter back in; then extract it until it is healed.
About the pus in the eye
This disease called "alcunnati" is nothing but pus that accumulates in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not water; and the way to identify it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take his head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the pus come to the surface in your eyes; then if it is fixed, and does not descend, and the light is clear, and the patient sees things as usual; and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the pus is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands, then take the delicate spatula and cut a little on the corneal tissue along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal tissue and the cornea, until the pus comes out; and when it is out, then distill warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or water in which fenugreek is boiled with honey, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
About the waters of the eye
We have already described the types of eye waters in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; do so according to the healthiness. You must make the patient sit between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and compress it very strongly; then place the eyelid of the eye in your left hand if the eye is the left one, or in your right hand if the eye is the right one; then take in your right hand, if the eye is the left one, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand if the eye is the right one; then place the point of the instrument near the cornea by the thickness of a line in the white part of the eye at the side of the smaller tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" strongly, and turn your hand until it pierces into the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the hollow part; and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be to the depth of the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye; you will see the bone in that paper through the clarity of the corneal tissue, and you can place the instrument to where the water is, then press it below one path after another. If the water descends immediately, the patient will see in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
Then rest a little, and if the water rises again a second time, place it with the instrument, and when it is fixed and it does not rise, then lightly withdraw the almagda by turning your hand little by little; and then place a little of ground rock salt in the water, and wash the eye inside. Then place on the outside of the eye wadding or wool moistened with rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.  We, and those of our time, place ground cumin with egg white on it.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye because of its hardness, for there are some men who have very hard eyes, then you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle hole, then place the almagda as we have said; and at the completion of the procedure prepare for the patient a suitable bed, where he sleeps on his back in a dark place; and he should be deprived of all movements, and take light food, and not move his head neither to the right nor to the left, and be bound according to his condition until the third day; then untie him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see some things, and then rebind him until the seventh day; and it is not necessary to do this at the time of the procedure or immediately after the incision, but it is necessary to delay this, because the water rises quickly.
If a hot abscess comes, you must untie the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with what soothes the abscess; and when it is soothed, then untie the vision and place a small pillow on his face to cover it for a few days, and keep him in that dark room. And then let him go out of the house little by little, and return to his normal activities; and know that no disciples should interfere in this case.
And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in his country they make a pierced almagda, with which they suck the water, but I never saw any in our land, nor did I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the forms of the almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them; and they should be properly made of brass:
And let their heads be of the same delicacy, and the back in three sharp angles.
About the flesh on the nose
Sometimes diverse types of flesh grow on the nose, some resembling scorpions with many legs; and some with flesh that is encrusted in a dark color, and some with soft flesh of good color. In those cases of flesh that are soft and not encrusted, you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and throw the hook at that flesh, and pull it out; then cut what you can sustain with a delicate sharp spatula on one side, until you know that all the flesh is removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then open it with a delicate instrument lightly, so that nothing remains; and if blood overflows, or a hot abscess appears, treat it as necessary; and if it is a malignant abscess, quickly cauterize it until the blood is staunched and all the flesh is removed, then throw vinegar and water or wine into the nose.
If the nose works and moisture comes down to the palate, know that it is healed; and if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is flesh grown in the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut: then you must place a slightly thick linen thread, tied with many knots, with a space of a finger or less between each knot; and let the patient put the head of the thread in his nose as much as he can, and draw it by smelling until it comes through the nose into the mouth; and children in schools often do this, and it is an easy thing for one who wants to do it; then hold the head that comes through the nose in one hand, and the other head that comes through the mouth in the other hand, and pull one after the other by the knots on the thread. Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted that flesh, then pull the thread, wipe the blood, and moisten the thread with Egyptian ointment, and replace it in the nose as before; do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh; then place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them; and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, into which the oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And let it be made of silver or brass, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the same conduits; and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be used for purging the head; and have a handle on the head for holding it when heating the oil or any liquid.
About the flesh on the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" grows on the tip of the nose, and it grows and becomes large, so that it is a noticeable thing to look at; and therefore you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then place a cautery or burning medicine on the area; and if it is delayed in cutting until it is large, then observe if it is hard, of dark color, of poor quality: do not touch it with iron because it is a malignant abscess, because when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the patient; and if the abscess is of soft touch, not of dark color, and you see that it can be cut completely, then empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the area with drying and constricting substances.
When the nose is cut and sewn
Know that when a separation occurs in one of these cartilaginous operations, it is of little benefit, except in some men. So, when this happens to someone, look to see if the wound is fresh with its blood; then join the two lips with a suture, and treat it until it is healed; and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must scrape all the parts of their flesh until they bleed, then join the two lips with a suture, and compress it, and sprinkle with dragon's blood powder and ground incense; and place on the powders a piece of strong plaster or another binding plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the suture is that you join the separation: either with needles, as we have said in the suturing of the belly; or with thread, as I have made known to you.
About abscesses of the lips
In many men, hard abscesses, resembling grains of vetch, form inside the lips, both smaller and larger; then you must turn the lips, and cut above each knot, and take it with pincers and cut it in each part; then fill the area after the incision with ground vitriol until the blood is staunched; and then wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with drying substances until it is healed.
About the flesh of the gums
Many times, attached flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus"; you must then hold it with forceps, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow; then place ground vitriol on the area, or other constricting and drying powders; and if that flesh returns after the incision, as often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: it will not return after the cautery; and these are the forms of the instruments for cutting.
About tartar
Sometimes, inside the mouth between the gums, tartar that is unsightly and rough forms on the teeth; and sometimes the teeth become black, yellow, and green, to the point that the corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth become foul-smelling; then you must make the patient sit between your hands, with his head in your lap, and scrape the teeth where the tartar appears until nothing remains; and do the same for the blackness, greenness, yellowness, and other stains, until they are cleaned; and if you remove what is there at the first scraping, that is good; if not, then restart the next day and the third day, until you have scraped everything; and know that teeth require various forms of instruments for scraping, according to what the procedure shows, because the scrapers used for the outer teeth have different forms than those used for the inner teeth; and have these forms and others prepared with you.
It is necessary when you treat the tooth for its pain that you delay pulling it as long as you can, because it should not be done; because it is a very serious matter until there is no excuse for scraping. So when the patient is forced to pull the tooth, you must be sure of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they believe it is in the healthy tooth, and have the good tooth pulled; and yet the pain does not go away until the bad one is extracted, as we have already seen with these lords; and when you are sure of the aching tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gums on all sides; then move it with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly fix the forceps; and let the patientâ€™s head be in your lap between your knees, and hold him well so that he does not move.
Then extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out, take one of these instruments and insert it on each side lightly, and move it as you did at first. And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with cloth where the holes are; and then extract it delicately with forceps, so that it does not break during extraction; and you must work very carefully around the gums to loosen the tooth.
And be careful not to break it, and leave a part behind, causing the patient greater pain than before due to the root. And beware not to act like some ignorant surgeons, who, in their haste and boldness, sometimes break the jaw and do not administer what we have described; but sometimes cause great harm by leaving the roots behind or breaking the jaw, as we have often seen; and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and salt; and if there is bleeding, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol; and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The forms of the instruments used to loosen the teeth first should have long points and thick handles, so they do not bend when you pull the tooth; and these are the forms:
And they should be thick so they do not bend when pulling, and made of well-crafted iron, and should have teeth to hold the tooth firmly.
About the root of the teeth When the root remains after extraction, you must place cotton moistened with butter on the area for one or two days, until the area is softened, then insert the forceps called "algefri," whose head resembles a swanâ€™s beak; and inside they are made like a file and this is the form:
And if the roots do not come out with these forceps, you must uncover the flesh all around the root, and place the instrument called "althali," that is to say, lever, of which this is the form:
And it should be strong and thick so it does not break, and if the root comes out with this, that is good; if not, use all the instruments, of which the forms come after this:
And also use this instrument which has two branches, of which this is the form:
and other tools that are used in the reasoning of teeth, and this instrument which resembles large forceps, of which this is the form:
And let these instruments be strong so they do not break, and know that there are many dental instruments; and also other instruments, which are not listed; and the wise and skillful master finds his instrument by himself, according to what his works and the disease show him, because there are some diseases for which the ancients did not teach any instrument due to the diversity of cases; and if the jaw or other bones are broken, or it decays, then search for the instruments that are needed, which I have told you about, and use the forceps, of which this is the form: And let them be thick and good at holding to grip the bone, so it does not escape, but can be held and removed; and then restore the area with appropriate medicines, and if there is decay in the bone, and it is small, scrape it with this instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to their natural position, and the form is unsightly, especially in young women, then you must know if the tooth is born after the other tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be filed or smoothed: then scrape it; and if it is aligned with the tooth, take this instrument of which this is the form, and it resembles a small beak, and is made of sharp iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is visible that it can be filed, then file it with such a file as this form shows:
and it is like the file used for making needles; and file the tooth little by little over several days lightly, so that it does not move until it falls; then smooth it at the end with some kind of scraper, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, then you must file the roughness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue or corrupt speech.
When the teeth are loose
When the front teeth are loose, either from a blow or from falling, and the patient cannot press on what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with constricting medicines, and that does not work; then they must be restrained with a gold thread, because the silver thread turns green and rots, but the gold does not change; and the thread should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth; and if you want to align the teeth, take the thread and insert it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you wisely reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then start the binding again until the part where you began, and tighten your hand delicately and wisely, until it does not move; and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape. Then cut the ends of the thread with forceps, and reinsert them between the healthy teeth, and place it so that it does not hurt the tongue; and then leave it tight as long as it can stay, and if it comes loose, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread; it will stay and serve thus for a long time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the alignment of the two healthy teeth and the two loose ones, as you see:
And when the teeth fall, they are put back in their place, again and again, as we have said; and no one should handle it who is not wise and patient, and sometimes the form of a tooth is made from cow bone, and it is placed where it is missing, and tightened as we have said, and it stays and serves for a long time.
Of cutting the frenulum of the tongue
Sometimes this ligament that comes from under the tongue is natural, as some are born this way; or it is from an accident of a healed wound; and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, with his head in your lap, and lift the tongue; then cut the nervous ligament broadly, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from the healing of a wound, then insert the hook and cut broadly that attachment; and ensure the incision is not too deep, because of the artery below; and when you are done, wash the area with rose water and plantain water, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue; and the patient should hold it every night, so the wound does not heal. And if bleeding occurs, apply powdered vitriol to the wound; and if the bleeding persists, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it turning a dark color or becoming hard, without the patient feeling it, do not touch it, for it is a cancer; and if it turns white and is moist, use the hook and cut with a fine spatula, and release it on both sides; and if bleeding occurs during your procedure, apply powdered vitriol until it stops, then continue your work until you remove everything; then wash the area with plantain water and salt, and treat with other remedies until it is healed.
Of the abscesses of the throat
Sometimes inside the throat, lumps called "godath" appear, properly known as the two tonsils, and when you treat them as we have described earlier, and they are not healed, take note: if it is a hard abscess of little substance and a dark color, do not touch it with a knife. And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with a knife either, because of the risk of bleeding; but leave it until it ripens, and then you can split it, or it will rupture on its own; and if it is white and round in color, and the root is thin, prepare the instrument for cutting, but first ensure the hot abscess is calm and settled. Then seat the patient in front of the sun, with his head in your lap, and open his mouth and have the assistant hold his hands, and press down the tongue with the instrument, which has this form; and it should be made of silver or fine bronze like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out as much as you can; and pull some of the surrounding tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, which has this form, resembling forceps; and the ends are curved, one towards the other, and very sharp, made of fine iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument, cut it with forceps, which have this form:
And it should be sharp on one side, and not on the other; and when you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same way, and after the incision have the patient gargle with warm water, and water and plantain, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water, or boiled pomegranate peels, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding stops; then treat it until it is healed; and sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides the two tonsils, then cut them just like the two tonsils in the same way.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had developed inside her throat, which was a small abscess; and it had nearly closed her entire throat, so she could not breathe through the blocked passage, and could not eat or drink, and would have died if she stayed that way for a day or two. The abscess had grown so much that it had pushed through both nostrils. I hurried immediately, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus; then did the same with the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue; then inserted the hook into the abscesses, and cut part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of her throat was unblocked, and she started to drink water and then wine, and I kept cutting that abscess for a long time; and the abscess kept growing back, filling the space I had emptied, until it became very large; then I tricked it and cauterized it inside the throat: so it remained without growing; and I left that area, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
Of the uvula
When phlegm descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and long, it is called "perpendicular"; and if it is swollen and round below, it is called "uvula". When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is not effective, and you see that the hot abscess is calm, and it is thin, you must cut it; and the one that is round and not long; and if it is blood-red or dark in color, you must avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient. It is necessary then, when you see it, according to the way I have described, its whiteness and length, that you make the patient sit in front of the sun, and press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the cutting of the two tonsils. And you must only cut the excess that is beyond the natural limit; for if you cut more, it will harm the voice, and speech; and after the cutting, use what we have said in the cutting of the two tonsils, and treat it until it is healed. And if the patient is afraid of cutting, you must use a device to cauterize it without fear. And the manner of cauterizing is with a sharp instrument. And it is that the patient places his head in your lap, and then you press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned in the chapter on cautery, and fill it with quicklime water, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the end of this instrument with it, which has this form:
And it should have a hair-like tip where the medicine is placed, like the tip of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula; and the patient should lie on his side, so that the saliva and mucus run from his mouth away from the medicine, so that it does not descend into the throat and cause harm; then hold the instrument with the medicine and press it on the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it blacken and the burning of the medicine is eased; and if you want, take cotton and wrap it on an instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with the cotton on the uvula, so that the cotton sticks to the uvula; and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then let it dry, and it will fall off after four or five days. And if you need to repeat the cauterization with the medicine, do so, and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter, and clean the area of the medicine; and rinse with cold water, and treat with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than cutting or cautery; if it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, chamomile, oats, and similar herbs, and combine all or some of them in a pot, and add plantain, and boil them; and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot have an instrument with this tip: And it should be made of silver or fine bronze, and one end should be placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is mortified; then repeat this often, until the uvula dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the hot abscess, as many things can happen; and only do this when the hot abscess is in decline. And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and place an eggshell at the end, so that the patient's mouth does not get too hot; for the eggshell prevents the vapor from harming the mouth, and it is a good and safe treatment.
Many times, a bone or fish spine or something else gets stuck in the throat; so you must try to extract what you can see, and press down the tongue in the sunlight with an instrument, so you can see the object; and what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the object will come out through vomiting; or the patient can swallow a piece of sponge, or a piece of turnip, or a lettuce root, or a morsel of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge, and then have him swallow it; and when it reaches the spot, it will stick, and then you will pull it out; and if it does not come out with what we have said, then take an instrument of lead in this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the end so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the end raised; and be careful not to touch the epiglottis, so the cough does not occur, nor push the bone in; and better that the patient inserts the instrument, as he knows where the object is; then push it down, or pull it out evenly with the instrument, until it is out.
Of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I said in the division, by the treatment of medicines; and when this does not work, then look in the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you press the tongue with the instrument I told you about. And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with fine forceps suitable for this. And if this does not work, take a tube with a wide end, and insert it into the patient's throat, then insert a hot iron at the end of the tube, and do this often. And let the patient drink water all day. Then take a glass full of cold water, and open his mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafetida, using the instrument I mentioned in the fumigation of the uvula; do this many times, for it will fall off without delay. And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot with live coals, and the pot is covered with a lid with a hole in the middle, and in that hole is the head of the instrument; then add your fumigation, and the patient places the head of the tube in his mouth, and closes his mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but goes to the leech; and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall, repeat the fumigation many times; and let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty and garlic things, and not drink any water; and then it will be necessary for it to come out by this method.
And the form of the instrument to extract the leech, when it can be seen, is like curved forceps to easily enter the throat; and it resembles a bird's beak, and has a rough surface like a file, so that what it grabs, it cannot let go; and here is the form:
The chapters on abscesses
There are many types of abscesses, as mentioned later in this book, and they differ in perforation and cutting; and there are two types, one in its own form, and one due to the place where it is on the body. For the abscess of the head is different from that of the anus, and the abscess of a fleshy area is different from one that occurs in joints, and each has its own judgment in the procedure.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the pus is ripe according to its development; and there are those that must be pierced when they are ripe, and do not mature according to their completion, like abscesses that are near joints. For when abscesses come near joints, and they are left until they are rotten around, perhaps the ligaments and nerves of the joint are corrupted, causing contraction in that member. Or the abscess is near a vital organ, and if you delay the perforation until it is mature, it will harm the vital organ; or it is near the anus, so it should be pierced before it is mature; and it is not necessary to pierce an abscess that is ripe without completed digestion, except for those near the anus, so it does not rot deeply, and become prolonged within, and develop a fistula; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for the perforation of the abscess that is mature according to its completion, and this is when the pain is eased, and the fever is gone, and the reduction of pain and redness, and the softening and sharpening of the head of the abscess, and the other signs; and you must make the perforation at the lowest point of the abscess, where it is most visible; and the perforation should be lengthwise along the body, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and on nerves and arteries, and in all places where there is no bending.
And in those that bend, along with that member. And when an abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better to leave the perforation until it is fully digested, as we have said. For if you pierce it before then, the venomous substance will spread, and it is filled with much filth; and perhaps the lips and depth of it will harden. And there are some abscesses that are pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the member needs. And you must administer small perforations in small abscesses; and large perforations in large abscesses, and many incisions according to the size of the abscess; and there are abscesses where you must cut the core, and cut; when it is already like a scab, and is dead, you must do as you do with buboes: and there are those that are split into three angles, and those that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the groin; and those that have a round cut, and other cuts and similar shapes.
Those that have no head, like superficial soft abscesses, you must pierce completely; and when the abscess is large, and it has gathered much pus, and you pierce it, do not extract all the pus at once, but extract a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then extract some more; do this many times gradually, until all the pus is out; especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or small children, or old decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes escapes with the release of the pus, and the patient dies, and you do not realize it. Avoid this situation with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, wipe the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a complete cut, administer linen or old cotton tents; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must place a tent in each one so that they come together; and if you have cut part of the skin in the abscess, and you have removed it around, you must fill it with old cotton or linen shavings without moisture, and bind it until the third day; then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs during your procedure, administer cold water and plantain, and soak a cloth, and apply it to the bleeding area several times. And if the bleeding persists, administer treatment and care, and the powders I have mentioned in many places in this book, and if it is winter, and the area where the abscess is very nervous, you must apply tents and cloths soaked in hot wine and oil; and if it is summer, and the area is fleshy, you must apply cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said; and then loosen the abscess and wipe and treat it, as necessary, until it is healed.
And this must be universally known in the treatment of abscesses: now I have told you how to proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
of deafness
In the head area, small abscesses appear, and they are like nuts in a shell, similar to a hen's yolk, and there are many types. Some are fatty and some contain moisture like pus; and some are hard and stony to cut, and there is no doubt if the artery does not interfere. And the procedure for cutting is that you test with an instrument called "entromissoire," whose form is given hereafter, to see what it contains. For if it contains moisture, then cut it lengthwise. And when the moisture is emptied, then scrape without leaving any skin that contains that moisture, for it returns quickly if anything is left; then soak cotton in Egyptian ointment if available; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and this drains what remains of the moisture. Then repeat the cotton treatment as before, the second day, and the third, until you are sure there is no moisture left; then treat the wound with suitable ointment until it is healed. And if the abscess contains a fatty core, cut it in this form, lengthwise; and insert your hooks, and scrape it from all sides, and focus all your effort on extracting the core where it lies; and if the artery interferes, do what I told you later. And do the same for the abscess if it is stony, and for cutting and treating as I have described.
And the cutting of the stony and moist abscess is easier, for they contain little blood. And there are some of these abscesses in the head where there is no moisture, and such was an abscess I cut in the head of an old woman; and I found the abscess like a flint stone, rough and white, and could not break it; and if someone had struck it, they would have made a wound as if on a stone. In other abscesses occurring on the head, except those that come on the heads of children and at the roots of the ears, the opening should always be at the lowest point, to allow the pus to exit; and treat them as necessary.
of scrofula
These abscesses often appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they appear elsewhere on the body, and they are many, and are joined together. And each scrofula is properly within its own capsule, like the nuts and abscesses of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. Some contain moisture, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment. In those that you see with a good appearance to the touch, and resemble the color of the body, and move in every direction and are not attached to the nerves of the neck or to the artery or to the duct, and are not deep; you must cut it from above, and scrape it from every part, and stretch the two lips of the cut with hooks, if needed, as we have said in abscesses of the head; and pull it out little by little, and be careful not to cut the nerve or the vein, and the spatula should not be too sharp or cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and does not go too deep, so you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, apply powdered vitriol to the wound, or some powders that stop bleeding, and compress the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calm, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot. And when the bleeding stops, return to your work, until you complete it; then feel with your index finger if any small scrofulas remain, cut and clean them. And if there is a large vein in the root of the scrofula, do not cut that scrofula at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread, and let it fall off by itself, without harm; then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scrofula, you must bring together the two lips of the wound, and stitch them immediately, so that there is no remaining excess because of the size of the scrofula. You must focus on cutting its root and extracting it, and stitch it as we have said. Those scrofulas that contain excess fluid, pierce where it appears mature; and pierce it as the one mentioned earlier, at the lowest point, then administer tents with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption; and when the wound is well cleaned, treat it with ointment that promotes flesh growth, until it is healed.
Of squinancy
The ancients spoke and wrote about the incision of the throat; but I never saw anyone in our land who performed it, and it is in their writings.
For those who have squinancy, it is necessary that the opening of the throat called "epiglottis" is cleared; and that no aid is given in this way, because all the veins and the lungs of the patient are affected by hot abscesses in the mouth, throat, or the two tonsils. When the disease is in the airway of the lungs, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the loss that comes from strangulation.
So, when we want to split the epiglottis, we should cut it below the third or fourth ring with a small transverse incision, between the two rings or according to the size of the membrane's incision, not in the cartilage;
and this area is suitable for the incision of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are sufficiently distant.
And if the surgeon is fearful, he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then cut the membrane until he reaches the channel; avoid the blood vessels if any are seen, then cut the membrane as we have said;
and it is indicated by the phlegm of the channel that comes out through the broken place, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time of strangulation risk has passed, bring the two lips of the wound together, and sew it without including the cartilage; then apply medicines that promote flesh growth, until it is healed.
Albucasim said not to do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breath is failing. Then, the epiglottis is cut because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this reason, the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease is past, and it passes in three or four days. And then they commanded to sew the wound and heal it until it was cured;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife and stuck it in her throat, and cut part of the channels of the lungs;
and I was called to heal her, and I found her almost dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had come out, and knew well that she had not cut any veins or conduits except the throat, and the wind was coming out through the wound.
I hurried, and sewed the wound, and healed it until she was healed;
and it happened to the young lady that she was hoarse of voice, and later returned to her normal state;
therefore I say that in the incision of the epiglottis, there should be no fear.
Of the swollen throat
This abscess is called "hernia of the throat," and is a large abscess the color of fat, and is common in women;
and it is of two kinds: natural, and accidental; the natural one has no remedy.
And the accidental kind is of two types, one resembling a fatty knot, and the other resembling an abscess that comes from an artery; and it is dangerous, and should not be treated with iron except in the small one, and it should be tested and examined with the probe: if you find it like a fatty knot, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it as one cuts knots, and pull it out with its membrane, if it has one; and examine everything well, and treat it properly until it is completely healed.
Of knots
There are many kinds of knots, of which I will describe all the types;
and now I must explain the difference between a knot and an abscess.
I say that an abscess involves heat and fever until the swelling has passed, and the suppuration is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
With a knot, there is neither heat, fever, nor pain, and it contains a sac, which is its own sac and is the color of the body, and it starts like fat and becomes large;
and there are two types, either fatty or moist, and they come in many colors as I described earlier.
When you come to treat a knot, you must first test and examine it with the instrument called an "entromissoire," as its form will be shown in the chapter that follows.
And the way to investigate the abscesses of knots is to take the moistest part you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know the instrument has pierced the core, according to the size of the abscess;
then remove the "entromissoire," and observe what comes out.
If flowing moisture comes out, note its color, and make an incision as I have said for other abscesses;
and if no moisture comes out after using the "entromissoire," know that it is fatty, and make a cross-shaped incision, and take it with forceps, and gently peel it from each side and make sure to remove the sac in which it lies whole with the knot;
and if you cannot remove it whole, remove it in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the knot will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, fill the wound with some corrosive powders, and tighten the wound, and apply things that soothe hot abscesses, and treat it with other cures until it is healed;
and if the knot is large, sew the two lips of the wound, and treat it with things that generate flesh.
and if the beating vein hinders you or something else, hasten and fill the place with powdered vitriol, and leave it tied for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the blood's boiling subsides; then return to cut what remains of the knot.
Here are the forms of the "entromissoire" instruments, and they come in three types: large, medium, and small; and there are three square ones called "albaret," and one called "breb," and they come in three types: large, medium, and small, for probing fistula abscesses;
and they are like the needles with which you sew stitches, and they are made of yellow brass, or iron, or silver, and those that are yellow are better, and the black lead ones are better for probing the curves of fistulas;
and they come in three types: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the width of the holes.
The forms of hooks have many variations, as you see here: large, medium, and small; and there are hooks with two curves in three different ways as well;
and there are hooks with three curves, and they also come in three types; and there are hooks with two curves, and hooks with one curve only, and they come in three types; and all these are necessary in their place.
The heads of these with which you cut are sharp, and some of them only cut on one side, with which you peel the knots, so that you do not cut the vein or the nerve;
and these "entromissoires" have blades set in handles, so that the patient does not notice them when opening abscesses;
and they come in three types: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and they are only used in fleshy places, like legs, arms, breasts, groins, and similar places;
and sometimes another small instrument is made, resembling the bark of a pistachio, in this form, to stop bleeding:
and it is sometimes placed where there is bleeding from the veins, and the arteries, and sometimes rounded in this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so that they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, must cut them according to this form from line b. to g.: then peel the fat, and fill the wound with medicine that generates flesh, then sew the two lips of the wound together, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast droops down, and is softened due to its size as happens to women, then cut it in two parts on top, with two similar incisions; of which one is connected to the other at the end of both, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form, from line b. to line g.; then peel the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary for the cure, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not fully done, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the blood flow, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it is healed.
Of abscesses of the armpits
These abscesses that come under the armpits are types of hard scrofula with sacs, and some contain moisture.
Those that contain moisture must be cut in this form, from line b. to line g.: And when all the pus in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat it with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess resembles scrofula, cut it as we have said for scrofula incisions, and if the wound discharges pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
Of the rupture of the artery
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin is healed over it, abscesses often form, and it is the same with a swollen vein and abscess;
and it is known this way when it is from the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel a tightness; and when it is from the vein, it is round and visible on the surface;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits and in the groin and on the neck and in many other places, and it is very large. So it is necessary to avoid the iron treatment, and the one that is at the top should be avoided as well, and in the one that is from the swelling of the artery, cut lengthwise above the skin;
So it is necessary to avoid the iron treatment, and the one that is at the top should be avoided as well, and in the one that is from the swelling of the artery, cut lengthwise above the skin; then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle under it, and pierce it to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries in the temples;
then puncture the place between the two ties with an "entromissoire" until the blood comes out, and the abscess is relieved;
then administer the treatment that generates flesh, until the ties fall off; then treat it with suitable ointment until it is healed;
and if the abscess is from the vein, you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess with the skin as you can, then place the needle under the place you are holding, and pierce it, and place a double thread, so that you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with a tie on one of the two sides with the two ends of the thread;
and if you are concerned that the thread may not hold, place another needle with a thread under the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess so that the excess comes out, then cut the excess of the core and leave what is tied;
then place a cloth moistened with wine and oil on it, then administer tenting and ointment treatments until it is healed.
Of the abscesses of the nerves
Just as abscesses occur in the artery and vein, abscesses can occur in the nerves when they are struck, or from too much work, and similar things.
And this happens more often in the joints and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in many cases without pain;
and when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but just under the surface;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, nor below nor above, and the one in the joints should not be cut with a knife: there could be a contraction;
and the one that is on the head or on the forehead, split the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, peel it, then remove it and sew the wound, and treat it until it is healed.
Of the large hanging swellings Sometimes thelul occurs in the belly and nowhere else, and it is a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to fungi, with a thin root and a large head; and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two on his belly that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, with thin roots, and were already split, and moisture was constantly flowing from them.
I cut them and found one weighing 18 ounces, and the other 6 ounces, and the procedure for the incision is that you see if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white and moist with thin roots;
then cut it with a broad spatula, and have the cautery ready in the fire. Because often there is too much blood flow during the cutting, and if the blood overwhelms you, then quickly cauterize it;
and if you see the patient is frightened and afraid of the knife incision, take a well-made lead thread, and tie the growth as we have said, and leave it for two days;
then tighten it, and keep tightening the lead thread until it cuts through the growth, and it falls off by itself without trouble; and if the roots are large, it is dangerous to cut, especially for the belly, but you can cut half of it,
then cauterize it so it doesn't return; then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the thelul that is of dark color and poor quality and looks bad.
Because it is a cancerous abscess, and I will come to the treatment of cancer later.
When the boil bursts out
If the appearance of the swelling comes from the cautery of a wound or from the split of the sac, and it is on the belly and some pus comes out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries as mentioned before, or from windiness;
and if it is from the rupture of the sac and the exit of the intestine, the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body, and it is an easy thing without pain, and it appears in various forms. And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then it is more varied, and when pressed with fingers, it recedes, and then returns, and perhaps it is squeezed, and grows a lot when entering the bath and from hard work.
And if it is from moisture, it is an easy thing, and it is clear when you press it with your hand, and it does not contract; and if it is from blood, the signs show a large and hard abscess, and it is fixed in one place;
and if it is from windiness, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is that you see if the appearance is from the blood of the artery, or the vein, or windiness. So you must leave the treatment. Because there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, for the artery and for the vein.
And if the appearance is from the intestine or the bowel, you must order the patient to hold their breath, and lie straight, then mark around the swelling; then command him to lie often in your hands, then go around the place you have marked with the spatula, then extend half of the abscess above with the large hook;
then open the half of the abscess stretched over the tie, and put your index finger in it, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the tie, then untie it, and push the intestine back inside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then take it with the hook, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or the vein hinders you, then go carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles, and put in them two strong threads, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross that you had pierced;
then tighten the abscess in four places on the needles, and if you want, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh falls off by itself; or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten, then treat it with what is needed, and finish the abscess as we have said;
or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten, then treat it with what is needed, and finish the abscess as we have said; and extract the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is needed, and seal the place.
Of the chancre
We have said in the division the characteristics of cancer, and how it should be treated with medicines, and how to avoid the treatment with iron; and we say cancer developed in the womb, and there is great caution in the treatment, and the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where it can be scraped out such as cancer in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, it should be completely removed when it is in the beginning; and when it is large and old, then you should not approach it, because I never managed to heal any; nor did anyone heal any before me.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you sometimes purge the patient of black bile; then make him bleed if he has clear excess, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the procedure; then throw your hooks into the cancer, and pull it from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything; and let the blood flow completely, and press the place well with your hand or something, and if the bleeding troubles you from the incision of the artery or the vein, then cauterize it until the blood stops; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already mentioned in the division the characteristics of dropsy, and how the collection of water is made, and the signs of each type, and the treatment that is done with medicines, and the one that is treated with iron: it is only eclites; and one should not touch with iron in these two types: namely, tympanites and yposarche, because it is a deadly thing; so when you treat this type of dropsy called "eclites" with medicines, and the treatment does not work, then see if the patient is weak, or if he has another disease besides dropsy, such as cough and looseness of the belly and similar things; then do not touch with iron, because there is doubt; and if you see the patient has strong vitality, and he has no other disease besides dropsy alone, and he is not too young nor too old, then you should proceed as follows: lift the patient upright in your hands, and the assistant presses the belly pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the pointed spatula in this form: and it should be sharp on both sides and pointed, but not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when it is inserted, and cannot injure them;
then see if the dropsy is formed towards the intestines: then you must cut above the belly three fingers width below the navel; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, then the cut should be on the left side of the belly three fingers; and if it is for the spleen, it should be on the right side, and the patient should not lie on the incision so that the fluids do not flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the sac as if peeling to the size of a fingernail or around; then pierce the sac until the spatula reaches the empty space, and that is the place of the water, then pull it out, and insert this instrument in this form: and it looks like a delicate silver tube, and is made of bronze or light brass, and has on the lower part a small hole; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on another; and the top is shaped like a pen, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribes shape the pen:
at the top is the blade, so that when the instrument reaches the water, it descends immediately on the instrument; then empty half or a third of it, because if you empty more than necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die from the loss of his life force, or he will faint, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the amount of his strength, and according to what the conditions of the patientâ€™s strength signify, and his pulse; then remove the instrument and retain the water, and it is retained now by the skin that stops the hole that is on the sac, which I mentioned, that you pierce in this manner; then reinsert the instrument the next day, if you see the patient tolerating it, and draw out a small amount of water;
do this for a few days, and be careful not to rush so that only a little water remains. And if you have doubts about the patient, and you leave a lot of water in him, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with a lot of sweating or baths and in the sun, and prevent him from drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach and over the liver and over the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I said before.
Of the obstruction of the penis Sometimes children are born without a hole in the penis, or the hole is small, or it is not in the right place. So it is necessary to immediately pierce it with a very fine spatula in this form: then place a fine lead nail in the hole, and tie it and leave it for three or four days and when he wants to urinate, the nail is removed, and he urinates, and then it is replaced; and perhaps it is not needed because the urine that comes out will not let it close. Those whose hole is small are treated with the lead nail, as we have said, and it will enlarge. Those who do not have the hole in the right place are injured, because some are born with the hole at the top of the penis, so they cannot urinate unless they lift their penis high; and they cannot impregnate because the semen cannot reach the womb, and this is a bad condition.
And the procedure is that the patient should lie often on his back, then stretch the tip of the penis and cut it like the shape of a pen, so that the hole is in the middle, as it should be; and be careful of bleeding which often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the pustules of the penis Many times these pustules appear on the penis, and it is an ugly appearance of flesh; and there are malignant and non-malignant ones; then you must take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then put cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on them; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed. And if the pustule is malignant, of a rotten color and smelling bad, then you must use cautery. When you have cut it, and if the pustule is at the top of the penis, and is partly inside the skin and partly outside, then you must remove the pustule that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside. Because when you treat them together, the tip of the penis is not safe from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicles; then you must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate peel and vetch, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, then use the lunar cautery in this form: the cautery helps in two conditions together: namely, for bleeding, and for corruption; and if the tip of the penis is corrupt and contracted, then you must insert a lead tube into the urethra, and the patient urinates through it; and when the skin becomes attached at the tip of the penis which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens from a wound or abscess, then you must peel it with a fine instrument, until the attachment is loosened, and the tip of the penis is freed from all sides;
and if it is a difficult thing to separate it, then you must peel it with a spatula a little bit from the tip of the penis and the skin; then gently separate between the two, and place a fine linen cloth soaked in cold water, so it does not reattach.
of circumcision
Circumcision is not like the healing of other wounds; however, when we perform this procedure willingly, especially on children, it is necessary to make it the best and safest operation.
I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision of their children because they did not use it in their law, and we only have what we have learned through experience.
For I have seen most of the masters and surgeons performing circumcision with a scalpel, and scissors, and with a razor; the procedure was faulty because there are two layers, and perhaps they cut the top one and leave the one underneath.
Now it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and with the scalpel, the tip of the member is not secure; and with the razor, the blade might slip and cause complications, and often they heal without needing treatment, as I have seen.
Regarding the circumcision done with scissors and a thread tie, I have found it to be effective because the scissors cut both above and below equally well.
For when you press your hand, it cuts evenly in one go; but the thread must be tightly tied around the skin; and the way of the first procedure is to make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him enjoy in all the ways you can; then make him stand between your hands straight, and hide the scissors in your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them or any of the instruments; then place your hand on the penis and blow on the tip, and pull it up so that the tip of the penis is inside; then clean it well from the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it again slightly lower with another tie; and hold it with two fingers at the second tie at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the upper skin and pull the tip of the penis;
then make him stand between your hands straight, and hide the scissors in your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them or any of the instruments; then place your hand on the penis and blow on the tip, and pull it up so that the tip of the penis is inside; then clean it well from the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it again slightly lower with another tie; and hold it with two fingers at the second tie at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the upper skin and pull the tip of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little because it is cleaner that way; and put powder on it and on the powder a cloth soaked in the white of a cooked egg mixed with rose water, mixed with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for the circumcision is this: the two tips should be thin and sharp, and the tips should be as big as the handle equally:
the mistake of the circumcision is when the inner skin escapes the incision; then it is necessary to stretch it with your nail before the place forms an abscess; and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail, hold it with forceps, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and the area below the penis is swollen, then leave it until the hot abscess is soothed, and peel it lightly; then cut it as you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, as it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with healing powder that we have mentioned in the powder section, and if you cut the skin too much, and it goes above, it will not harm; treat it as we have said until it is healed.
of the retention of the urine
The retention of urine is caused by the obstruction of a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or flesh growth, or similar things that we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone that is already in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should bend over his knees; and place his feet on his back, and stretch his belly over his back, and the patient should hold his breath as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is forced to expel the stone, thus releasing the urine;
and if it does not come out as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you must administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," which has this form: it is made of fine silver, light, and shaped like a bird's feather; and the tube is a palm and a half in length, and fine at the tip.
The method of releasing the urine is to take a double thread, and tie a bit of wool or cotton at the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe; and cut the excess wool and push it to the end of the syringe, then coat the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a chair, and moisten his bladder and penis with olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the base of the penis, then bend the penis upwards towards the abdomen; then push the syringe forward until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reach the empty space, and this is done in this order only because the passage where it goes is twisted; then gradually pull out the thread with the wool, and the urine follows the wool, then remove it, and let the urine flow;
and repeat the syringe process until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
Of the diseases of the bladder
When abrasions or blood occur in the bladder, or decay is present, and you want to distill water and medicines there, do so with the instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three holes: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see; and the place at the top where the medicine flows should be such that it stops the penis without addition, so that the moisture can be drawn out, and pushed in when needed;
and when you want to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the kesteur in the moisture, and pull the plunger that is inside; this will draw the moisture into the kesteur, and then push the plunger back in forcefully; the moisture will enter, and come to the bladder immediately, so the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the fine clyster with which one irrigates the bladder: it is here:
It is made of silver or brass, and the top is higher; and below has a base where the ties fall; then take a sheepâ€™s bladder and put the moisture with which you want to irrigate the bladder into it, then tie it between the two bases with a good double thread, and warm the moisture a little over the fire; then insert the head of the clyster into the penis, then press your hand on the bladder with the moisture accordingly, until the patient feels that the moisture has come into the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle, and pierce it roundly around; then put a strong thread through these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a bowl, and put into it what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument; and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
of the stone
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones, and their extraction along with medicines; and I have explained the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stones one must operate with cutting; in the bladder, and in the penis; and I will explain it clearly and briefly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder occur more often in children, and it is a sign that the water jumps from the bladder similar to water in its subtlety; and sand appears, and the patient scratches his penis, and it often hangs, and then stiffens; and many of these stones pass through the urethra; and the treatment is easier for children until they are four years old, and it is very serious in the elderly, and moderate in the young, for those who are between youth and old age; and the treatment is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the feces that are in the intestines. Because it sometimes obstructs the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and shake him and move him below, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes it jumps from the high place; then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downwards; then search for and touch the stone inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then immediately hasten to cut over the stone. And if it does not fall completely to the touch, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a young adult; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, then move it to the neck of the bladder; then press down with your finger, and push it to the place where you want to cut.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to stretch the testicles upwards with his right hand, and with his left hand remove the skin that is under the testicles in the area where the cut is made; then insert the cutting spatula, which has this form:
And cut between what is between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but on the side of the left buttock; and be straight over the stone, and your fingers should always be in the anus, and the cut should be transverse so that it is wide on the outside, and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps pressing it with the finger that is in the anus, so it comes out without effort; and know that there are some stones with angles and edges: they are difficult to extract; and there are some that are smooth, like an acorn, and round, whose exit is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the cut larger; and if it does not come out, then it is necessary to grasp it with forceps that are like a file at the tip, to hold the stone so it does not slip; or you insert underneath it a fine instrument curved at the tip; and if you cannot manipulate it this way, then enlarge the opening a bit, and if the blood flows, then stop it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, then first push the largest to the neck of the bladder, then cut over it, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterward if there are several. And if it is very large, then it must be sawed, and the wound made larger. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine always comes through where the place cannot heal; but always strive to pull it out, or to break it with forceps, until you extract it in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense and aloe and dragon's blood, and compress it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then wrap the patient on his neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, then moisten the place well with oil and water, then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses form in the wound and corrosions, and clots of blood in the bladder, and the urine is retained because of this, which is known in such a way that blood flows with the urine: then insert your finger into the wound, and remove that blood, because if it remains, it corrodes the bladder, and rots it;
then wash the wound with water and hyssop and salt, and help it in all the ways you know, until it is healed; and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you tie his thighs together, and apply the medicines to the place.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot flow out; then treat it with what I mentioned before, that you often cut it, and one is excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven this method.
Take an iron drill according to this shape and it should have three angles fixed in a stick:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot go back into the bladder; then insert the drill into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the drill with your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side; then the urine will soon flow, then press your hand on what remains of the stone inside the penis. It will soon break, and come out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
and if you cannot do this because of something that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone and another above it, then cut the penis at the stone between the two ties, then remove it, and untie the thread, and clean the clotted blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone in women
It rarely happens that a stone forms in women, and if it happens sometimes, the treatment is difficult, and is hindered by three things: one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin; and the second is that one cannot find a woman willing to expose herself to doctors, especially if she is chaste.
And the third reason is that perhaps one cannot find a woman well-versed in this art with her hands; and the fourth reason is that the woman's stone is deeper than the man's stone, which requires a deeper cut, and there is great fear.
And if necessity compels this, then you must find a skilled female doctor, and it is difficult to find one, and if you cannot find one, then seek a chaste, subtle male doctor; and present him with a wise old woman knowledgeable in women's lives, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the search for the stone;
and examine very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the anus and search for the stone; and if she finds it, then press it under her finger, and instruct her to insert her finger into the woman's vagina, and search and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, then she must move it little by little from the entrance of the bladder to below, until it comes to the root of the thigh; then cut over the stone at the root of the thigh towards the middle of the vulva, where it is better positioned, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger above or below the stone, and make the first cut small;
then insert the probe into the cut, if you feel the stone then enlarge the wound so that the stone can come out, and know that there are many types of stones: namely, small and large and rough and smooth, long and round, and with roots. know their characteristics to understand the extraction.
And if the blood overcomes you, then apply powdered vitriol to the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped; then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments I mentioned for the extraction of stones in men to help you in your work;
and if the blood overcomes you, and it is from the artery that is cut, then apply the powder to the place and compress with tents and bandages, and do not repeat this, and leave the stone and do not extract it, because the patient might die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood is soothed, and the place is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
Of fleshy hernia
Watery hernia is nothing other than an accumulation of moisture or white syfac, which is under the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg; and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is actually in the tissue of the egg, so one thinks it is another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white syfac we mentioned; and this rarely happens.
And the generation of this hernia is from the weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either it is a color leaning towards jaundice, or it is red blood, or black, or watery white, and this happens more often;
and these are the signs to recognize this accumulation, because if it is in the white syfac that we mentioned, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear, because it has moisture all around.
And if there is moisture in the actual tissue, the abscess is round with part of the egg, and therefore one thinks it is another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white syfac, it can be felt well; so when you want to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square probe, the form of which is mentioned before. According to what comes out after the probe, judge what is inside.
According to what comes out after the probe, judge what is inside. And when we treat it with surgery, it is necessary that the patient be bled according to his strength and the fullness of his body; then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and place many cloths under him;
then sit on his left, and command the assistant to sit on the right, and stretch the penis to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles;
then take the blunt spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles along the length until near the base, and make the cut straight dividing the skin of the testicles until the white syfac, and peel it gently according to your ability;
then pierce the syfac full of water with a large opening, and extract all the water, and then use your forceps, and stretch the syfac upwards; and do not touch the skin of the testicles, but only the syfac; cut it all or in pieces, especially the side of it gently, because if you do not cut it well, the water will return;
and if the egg comes out during your work, put it back in its place when you have completed the work on the syfac; then join the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture, then treat it as other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the egg corrupted with another disease, then you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood; then cut the testicle with the suspensory, and extract the egg, and treat it as we have said.
And if the water is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two hernias; then cut the other part as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood, and put in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
and put outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and put it on the two testicles, and put over doubled cloths, and tie it all with a bandage in this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with teased wool according to this design and sew them together at the waistband of the pants, and one end takes the area from the perineum to the back, and the other to the base; and the other two ends on the two sides, and all the tightening should be assembled in the buckle of the pants;
and sometimes this hernia is treated with a cautery instead of an iron cut, and it is that you take a subtle knife-shaped cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and heat it as we have said, so that the white syfac containing the water is exposed;
then take the cautery in this form, and pierce the syfac with forceps, and peel it with this fine hot cautery:
And cut it in all the ways you can, until you scrape it all; and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg; and know that this procedure is safer; and more protective against blood flow, and better than the cutting procedure;
and if anything opposes you, whether it is a hot abscess or blood flow or something else, then treat what opposes you, according to what is said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not want to undergo this procedure because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I told you, and it is that when you are very sure by the signs we mentioned that the watery hernia is there,
then make the patient sit on a raised chair; then pierce the abscess in the lower part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation along the body; and the opening should be large, so that all the water flows out;
then put cotton on the place, and tie it, and let the rest of the water flow out, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white tissue does not let the water come out in the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a pen or the instrument with which one extracts the water from dropsy patients, the form of which is mentioned before; and enlarge the wound a little, and know that the water will return, and will gather again after six months or so, and thus the patient will pass his days.
Of the abscess of the testicles
Know that in the cutting of this branch there is fear in many situations, which is why it seems to me that it is often better to leave it alone;
And I will tell you the work and the types of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come to the body, and especially to the testicles; and this happens for many reasons.
That is, from sour and sharp excess, which spreads to the testicles, or from a blow;
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it does not cause pain, and it is a serious abscess;
And sometimes it is a serious, fearful, and dangerous abscess, and of dark color, and sometimes it comes from a node in the artery, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from a node in the artery, it is known by the hot abscessâ€™s disposition when you press it with your fingers; And you should not touch it.
The one that is made from swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the expression of finger touch,
And it is possible to make an incision on this kind, and on the other flesh; And it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then extend the testicle upwards, and pull it out from the white sac, and free the suspensory from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already attached to these born flesh, then it is necessary that you pull the testicle and cut it;
And if it is attached to the sac, or in what is inside the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that tissue and cut it roundly.
And if the growth of the flesh is in the back place, then it is necessary that you cut it all, and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is done, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other cures until it is healed.
Of the abscess of the testicles
This is an abscess enveloped in a covering resembling a bud, with the softening of the testicles, And the patient moves painfully when he walks;
And the treatment of this disease is almost as fearful as the one mentioned before,
And yet we will tell you the work of it, according to what the ancients did.
You should make the patient sit on a raised seat, then push the suspensory of the testicles down with your fingers, With all the vessels that are near the penis, and the master holds them, and extends them firmly;
Then cut with the broad sharp spatula across the vessels, until they are uncovered,
And then strip on each side, as we have said in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
Then stick a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first place where the infection has come, and tie it again at the other end; Then cut them in the middle straightly, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted moisture;
Then treat the wound as with others where pus forms, so that some vessels fall that nourish one of the testicles;
For from this comes no harm, and if infection comes to all the vessels, it is necessary to extract the testicles with all the vessels; So that the organ does not lose its nourishment due to the cutting of the vessels, and they dry out and cannot be helped.
Of the rupture of the syfac The occurrence of this rupture happens either by the cut that comes to the membrane (syfac) or the stretching over the belly in the groin area, causing the intestines to descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
And this rupture is either from the membrane or from its stretching, and these two ways come from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or shouting, or lifting heavy loads, and similar things;
And the signs, when it is from the stretching of the membrane, are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; And the abscess is equal to the depth, because the membrane presses the intestine.
And the signs, when it is from the cutting of the membrane, are that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears differently, just under the skin, because of the issue of the intestine and the body outside the membrane.
And sometimes the omentum descends with the intestine, and it is held there, causing great pain for the patient, especially when it is pressed.
And in these treatments, there is fear of using the knife, which is why it must be avoided.
And the way of the work is that you command the patient to push the intestine back inside the wound with his hand, if he can return it; Then have him lie on his neck between your hands and lift his thighs;
Then stretch the skin upwards and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; Then put inside the lips of the cut with hooks as needed to open the wound, and so that the organ can come out;
Then strip the membrane that is under the skin of the testicles until the white membrane is completely uncovered;
Then put your index finger in what follows the testicle, in what is between the white membrane that is under the skin of the testicle, and between the second membrane,
And separate what is behind the testicle and between the second membrane; and then move with the right hand inside the core of the testicles, and stretch the white membrane upwards with your left hand, and lift the testicle along with the membrane towards the cut; And command the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and untie what is behind the attachment;
And search with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped in the white hard membrane, and if you find anything, push it back into the belly;
Then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten threads, and push it into the back part of the membrane, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the cut, then cut the ends that appear from the threads until there are four threads; Then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the membrane, as we have said, which is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong tie in two parts; Then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them firmly in two parts so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter in a way that a hot abscess might come; And then place the tie again according to the first tie, two fingers long from it, and after these two ties leave the membrane that is under the core of the testicles the size of a finger;
And after all the rest according to the roundness that the testicle carries; then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, until the blood and the pus flow, as we have said before;
Then administer wool soaked in oil, and put it in the wounds, and administer the tie that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white membrane is cauterized, as we have said, after the incision, for fear of blood flow.
For this happens many times, and leave the tie until it falls by itself; and if it delays in falling, then it should be sprinkled with hot water, and put on what we have said, until it falls;
Then treat the wound with other cures until it is perfectly healed.
Of fleshy hernia
In this condition, I have never seen anyone who dared to treat it with a knife.
And the ancients said that it is done like the condition that is with infection, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the cut on the testicles lightly below;
Then cut in the middle, and treat the abscess as it appears, until the vessels fall; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture comes in the groin, as we have said, and the place opens; and no intestines descend to the testicles, and if any descend, it is little, and they return all the time;
And yet if it stays too long in this condition, the wound or membrane grows, so much that the intestines descend;
And this happens from the stretching of the membrane that is in the groin, as we have said, because it is stretched, then the place is softened and swollen and opens;
And the treatment is by cautery, as we have said before; and sometimes it is treated by knife in this manner:
And it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the place of the swollen rupture in width according to the size of three fingers;
And then extract the membrane that is under the skin that follows, then take the rod and put it on the apparent place of the membrane;
And press it to the depth of the belly, then sew the two apparent places of the membrane on the head of the rod, and sew one and the other;
Then extract the head of the rod, and do not cut the membrane or stretch the testicle or anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of the intestinal rupture;
Then treat it by the treatment of wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The membrane is constrained and does not appear in the rupture, and the cautery is better in this place and closer to healing.
on the softening of the skin of the testicles
Sometimes the skin of the testicles in some men becomes softened because the flesh inside is softened, and it is unsightly to see. When treating this, it is necessary to make the patient lie on his back and cut the softened skin on the natural skin; then join the two lips with a stitch. If you want, first sew the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches; then cut between the stitches and treat it like other wounds until it is healed, and the stitches fall out.
Of castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book; and it is only necessary for two reasons: one is so that the doctor knows how to respond when asked about it, and knows the treatment; the other is because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats, sheep, cats, and other animals. I say then that castration is done in two ways: by extraction or by cutting. In the method of extraction, we make the animal sit in hot water until the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand until they are relaxed and you cannot feel them anymore. For cutting castration: hold the animal, press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory ligament, and cut each egg with one cut, after properly peeling them; leave some syfac and the fine syfac on the vessels; and this method of castration is better than the extraction method, because with extraction sometimes some of the testicles remain, causing the animal to still desire to mate; then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism occurs in two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles there appears something like the female genitalia, sometimes with hair, and sometimes urine comes out of it. The other way is in women, where they have something like a penis and two testicles above the base. The treatment for both men and women is to cut all the extra flesh and treat it like other wounds. In the second way, in men where urine comes out through the skin of the testicles, there is no treatment.
Of priapism
Tentigene is an extra flesh added to the natural part, making it very unsightly; some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the treatment. It is necessary to hold the excess of the tentigene with your hand or forceps, and cut it lightly; do not go too deep to avoid bleeding, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed. Another type of flesh grows at the mouth of the womb, filling it, and sometimes it comes out, looking like a tail, which is why the ancients called it "tail disease." It is necessary to cut it as we said for the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Of wandering or erratic behavior
Erratic condition is when the female genitalia are not pierced, or the opening is small; it is congenital or occurs due to disease; or it is due to added flesh, or thick or thin syfac, located deep in the womb, or on the sides, or below, or anywhere; it prevents conception, childbirth, and sometimes menstruation. The knowledge of this is by the inspection of the midwife. If the blockage is visible, search with your fingers or a probe. If it is thin syfac and near the two lips, hurry and break it like this: put your two index fingers together, and the woman lies on her back with her legs spread; then spread the two lips firmly until the thin syfac is broken, and the blockage is opened; then take wool, moisten it in oil, and place it on the spot, and the woman should lie with a man every day, so it does not close again. If the syfac is hard and thick, cut it with a spatula resembling a myrtle leaf. If the blockage is of born flesh, suspend it with a hook and cut it; have hemostatic medicines ready, like acacia, dragon's blood, frankincense, along with egg white; then insert a wide lead tube so the wound cannot close; and keep it long, administering a dry linen tent; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood commonly flows, and when hemorrhoids are old, they become thelul; we have already described their appearances and signs in the division, and I will now explain those that receive treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and thelul, when they are deep in the womb and cannot be felt, are not treated with surgery. Those at the mouth of the womb, which can be felt, can be treated. The woman should be placed in a cold room, then extend the thelul with forceps, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle hemostatic medicines like acacia, dragonâ€™s blood, frankincense, and similar substances; then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water; and if there is bleeding, make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, galls, and similar things, then take barley flour, mix it with honey and egg white, and make a poultice for her back. If this stops the bleeding, it is good. If not, make her sit with cupping glasses on her back and breasts without cutting; then take wool, moisten it in plantain juice or dog rose juice with old wine, and apply it to the spot. When the abscess subsides, treat the place with ointment until it is healed; the condition called "albathir" is red and resembles a rough head, it must be cut as I described for the thelul; then treat it until it is healed.
of abscesses of the uterus
Many types of abscesses come in the womb, such as cankers, hard abscesses, herpes, estiomenes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and hot abscesses, and many other diseases mentioned in the division. I will now describe the hot abscess that comes in the womb, which is not one of those that collect pus; if you want to know the work of the iron, check if the abscess is acute at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red if you can see it.Then do not hurry to pierce, but let it mature until the pain subsides; then make the patient sit on a chair, with two small chairs where he can lean, support his back, and bring his feet together on the outside of the leg; his thighs should be spread, and his arms under his knees, and tie them well with a good tie; then suck the boil toward the right side, and use the instrument that opens the mouth of the womb, which is described later; and when you want to use this instrument, first insert the probe to know the depth of the womb so that the instrument does not go deeper than it should and does not harm the patient; if the instrument is larger, cover the depth of the womb with cloths so that the instrument does not hurt her; and the instrumentâ€™s cone should be above, and he should hold the instrument. When the abscess appears, and you pierce it with a soft hand, it should be cut at the head, with a blunt spatula; when the pus is drained, it is necessary to place tents moistened with rose oil, or with dry green oil; place the tent outside the wound at the depth of the womb, and place above on the womb and the base of the penis clean wool moistened in water or cooked mallows; then treat it after two days with appropriate ointment until it is healed; sometimes the womb and wound are washed with a clyster of water and honey, and then water with lily roots and long aristolochia cooked; then return to the ointment. If the wound is deep in the womb, avoid using iron, but treat it as we said in the division.
Of childbirth
First, the midwife must know the appearance of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pushing downward and wanting to smell something: then the child is about to come out; then know that this childbirth is according to the natural figure, and the exit is under its head, and the afterbirth with it; when you see these signs, gently press her belly so that the child comes out quickly; for when it descends on its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its superfluities by good purification; and those that come otherwise are not natural. For it sometimes comes on its feet, and the body or head comes out, and the hands, or it comes on its belly, or often, and it is sometimes turned on its neck, and other bad positions; so the midwife must be wise and skilled in these things, and avoid errors and deception, and I will show you all the positions and how to assist.
If the child comes on its head by natural exit, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, make her sit on a stool, or have women hold her; and moisten her genitals with oil or cooked fenugreek, then place between her fingers the small spatula of this shape: and cut the afterbirth, and tear it with your nail until the moisture inside runs out; press the womanâ€™s belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, give the woman an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil; then make her hold her breath and sneeze with condisi, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: the child will come out now. If the two hands come out, gently push them back little by little; if they cannot go back in, place the woman on a seat, and lift her feet up; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall when lowering; if the hands cannot go back in, and the child dies, cut the hands with the knife previously mentioned, extract the child, and reassemble it properly.
Of the birth of the child feet first When the child comes feet first, you must push it upward; and then turn it little by little, until it is aligned;
then take one of the feet and extend it little by little.
When it reaches the thighs, command her to hold her breath, and make her sneeze with condiments; then it will come out, if God wills.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then turn it little by little, until it is in the natural position. For then it will come out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, then take marshmallow mucilage, sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind it all in a mortar; and put this ointment inside and outside the womanâ€™s genitals, then make her sit in warm water up to her ribs;
and when she is softened below, make a necklace of myrrh for her, put it below, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, make her sneeze and pinch her mouth and nose, and press her belly gently, for the child will come out now. Of the birth of the child knees first When the child comes in this form, the midwife should place her hands little by little;
Of the birth of the child with one hand hanging out You must skillfully bring the hand back: if it cannot be brought back, make the woman stand up, and walk;
if she cannot walk, make her lie on a bed, and spread her legs firmly;
then administer the mucilage I have mentioned;
and if she does not give birth, make her sit on a seat, then carefully bring back the hand; and extract the child according to the natural position, and make her sneeze, and command her to hold her breath until the child comes out.
Of the birth of the child with its neck first, and its hands spread, and its face turned toward its mother's back The midwife must hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and extract it gently;
and when it is aligned, put marshmallow mucilage and oil on her genitals, as we have said, then command her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, make her sit on a seat, and command her to hold her breath; and make her sneeze. Of this same manner with the afterbirth
Of this same manner with the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the child hangs by its face and neck, cut it from the umbilical cord, so it is not retained, and the child dies;
then put the child back in, until you have placed it as it should be, and command the woman to hold her breath a few times:
Of the birth of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, though it rarely happens. Two are a strange thing, and they rarely live;
I know this, that they are multiplied, and are separated by the membrane that divides them, which is attached to the umbilical cord;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they come out with difficulty, treat it as we have said, and let the midwife be skillful, and do quickly and lightly what she must do; and do as best as possible for the safety of all. Of multiple births
Of multiple births Sometimes one or two or three or four or five or six or seven, or more up to fifteen children are formed in the uterus, and they are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the glorious sage,
and the midwife must know all this, for perhaps such a thing may happen to her; so do as necessary.
Of the dead child
When you treat a woman for a dead child in her womb, as I said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to manual work; then you must know if the woman has sound strength, and has no condition or fear of death;
then the woman must be supported on her back, with her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the assistant holds her on both sides, or she is tied to the bed so she is not pulled during the descent of the child;
then rub the opening of the uterus with moist oils mixed with marshmallow mucilage, fenugreek, and linseed, then the midwife anoints her hands with these oils and mucilages; then she gently places them in the uterus, then finds a place where she puts the hooks that are suitable for this,
and take care if the child is positioned to descend head first; then fix the hooks in its eyes or in its neck or in its mouth or in its palate or under the chin or in the armpit or near the ribs,
and if the descent is feet first, fix them in the wrist and the sides;
and he must hold the hook in his right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently put his whole hand in, and fix the hook in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then fix another hook against it, or a third if necessary, so that the extraction is even;
and then extend it evenly by moving from one side to the other, to make it come out, and the hooks should be toothed to hold better, as here is the form:
And if a part remains, the midwife anoints some of her fingers with oil, and places them in that part, and pulls out the other part;
and if any remains, put the hook in a higher place, and do this until it is all out.
And if one hand comes before the other, and it cannot be brought back because of the tightness, then you must wrap it in a cloth, until it is all out;
then cut it at the joint of the limb or at the elbow, and you must do the same with the other hand, and the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the exit is narrow, or there is fluid collected in the head, then you must put the spiked spatula between your fingers, and split the head and extract the fluid; or break it with the instrument called "almidach", the form of which is given with the instruments in the chapter after this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head; and then pull out the bones with tongs,
and if the head comes out and it is stuck at the collarbone, split it, so that the fluid in the chest comes out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it until the fluid runs out.
And if the child is feet first, the extraction is easier, and the adjustment to the mouth of the uterus is easy.
And if it is narrow in the belly or the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and split the belly or the chest, until the fluid runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, the midwife places her hand deep in the uterus, and pulls it to the mouth of the uterus; then places one or two hooks, and pulls it out;
and if the mouth of the uterus is narrowed by a hot abscess that has formed there, then do not try to work, but administer moist and greasy things; and administer plasters, and seat her in softening and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can align it, then administer what we have said for the live child;
and if it cannot be done, pull it out in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, administer what we have said for hot abscesses that form in the uterus;
and if a flow of blood occurs, put her in restraining water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived over it, and the other also died. After a long time, an abscess formed in the belly, and it swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to treat it, and I thought a long time, and the wound could not heal.
I applied a strong drawing plaster, and a bone came out, and after a few days, another. I was very surprised, because there are no bones in the belly.
So I thought these were the bones of a dead child.
I cleaned the wound, and extracted many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time this way, and a little pus always came out from the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only because, when the master finds a strange thing, he should know how to treat it.
On repositioning the uterus
Here is the form of the press, with which books are moved; it has two turners at the two ends of the two bindings. However, the horns should be more delicate than the restrictor and made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood should be a finger wide, and the edges of the boards a finger, and one and a half palms long; and in the middle of the two bindings, there should be two adjustments of the same wood, fixed in both, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two adjustments are inserted into the mouth of the uterus to open it when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar but more delicate and lighter, is made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs; and has at the two ends two adjustments, as you see, a palm long and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the uterus with the instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging and her legs open, then insert the two adjustments joined together into the uterus, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then operate the instrument with your hand, as you have done with the tongs, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the uterus, until the midwife does what she wants.
These instruments are all topped, and their forms are multiplied; and when the doctor has prepared them, the work is faster, and higher for men due to their size.
Do not despise the instrument without having prepared it, for its necessity is undeniable.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with snuff, and squeeze her mouth and nose with your hands; and if it comes out that way, that is good.
If not, take a pot, make a hole in the lid, and put herbs in it that can open the mouth of the uterus, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia wood, and centaury;
all these herbs, or some of them, are cooked in water in the pot over the fire; then put one end of a tube into the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the uterus,
and hold it until the vapor reaches the uterus; then make her sneeze, as we have said. The afterbirth will come out quickly. And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand with sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, and then insert it into the vagina,
and search for the afterbirth; and when she finds it, let her take it and gently stretch it straight, so that the uterus does not fall during extraction; but she must move it gently to the right and left, then pull; it will come and detach.
And if the mouth of the uterus is already narrowed, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and fumigating with herbs;
and if it does not come out after all that we have said, be careful not to pull recklessly;
but what is at the mouth of the uterus must be tied to the womanâ€™s thigh, then give her a clyster with tetrapharmacum ointment;
it will rot and detach, and come out; but always, when it rots, there will be a bad smell to the stomach and the head, and harm the patient.
So suitable fumigations are necessary: some of the ancients have tried fumigation with watercress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated for retained menses and afterbirth is this:
It is glass, similar to a tube, with the thin end inserted into the vagina, and the wide end over the fire;
and the fumigation is done over coals, and hold it until it is done, then start another.
Of piercing the anus
Many children are born who do not have their anus pierced, instead it is blocked by a delicate membrane: so the midwife must pierce that membrane with her finger, and not with a sharp spatula, and ensure she does not touch the lace;
then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you fear it might close again, place a lead tube in the opening, and leave it for a few days, and remove it when the child needs to go to the bathroom.
And sometimes this blockage comes from the healing of a wound or an abscess; then it must be cut: so it should be treated, as we have said with the lead tube.
Of anal fistula Fistulas that come below the anus are nodes, and swellings that come beside the anus externally, or in the space between the two parts,
there is one fistula or several; and when this node is old, it opens, and discharges watery moisture, whitish or subtle pus,
and sometimes these fistulas are piercing; and they are known by the fact that feces or gas come out when the patient defecates, and sometimes a worm comes out.
And there are fistulas that pierce to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and they reach to the joint of the thigh, and to the anus.
And thus one recognizes the piercing fistula in the anus, and the non-piercing one: and it is by inserting your index finger into the anus, and inserting a fine needle of brass or iron into the fistula when it is not tortuous.
And if it is tortuous, insert a fine lead probe, or a horsehair, until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and no feces or gas or worm comes from the opening, as we have said: know that it does not pierce; so hurry to treat it.
And when the fistula pierces to the bladder or to the urinary tract, urine comes out, and it cannot heal with medicines.
If it pierces to the joint of the thigh, the probe reaches to the place; if there is no tortuosity and the discovery of the pain around it, it means that pus always comes out, and no medicine or ointment can heal it;
and in these piercing fistulas, there is no cure except labor, and the vanity of foolish doctors who get involved.
In those that are not piercing and not old, there is hope of healing by surgery, as I have proven,
and the patient lies between your hands on his back; and you raise his legs to his thighs, and his thighs are inclined to his stomach; then insert a brass probe, or lead if it is tortuous, until you know where the probe comes.
If the patient feels it around the anus, you must insert your index finger,
and if you feel that the probe has pierced it; and it is discovered where you feel between your finger the membrane or the flesh, then know that it is piercing; then do not bother because it cannot be healed.
It is said that some can be healed, but this happens rarely;
and the aid given is that the fine cautery is heated according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned; and insert it hot into the fistula, until it comes near the anus; and do this two or three times, until you know that these foul flesh are burned, which resemble a bird's feather;
and then treat it with probes soaked in butter, until that flesh comes out, then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and heal.
If it is healed this way, it is good. If not, otherwise it cannot be healed;
and if the probe enters, and does not pierce to the finger in the anus, and there is between your finger and the probe a thick cover of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula under the cover of the skin; then cut it from the beginning of the fistula, and always insert the probe further, and then the cautery, until it comes to the end of the probe;
and the probe will be released, and will fall; then clean that foul flesh that looks like a birdâ€™s feather, and nothing remains.
And if the blood overwhelms you, and runs between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For the fire cautery combines two good things: namely, the burning of this added flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat it with probes soaked in butter or crushed things, until the place discharges pus, and the burnt flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with healing ointments generating hard flesh, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if the fistula reaches the depth of the anus, and is away from the body, insert your finger into the anus, and investigate it.
If you feel the probe, and between them is the membrane or flesh, or it is about to pierce, there is no other way but confidence and hope, by administering one of the three methods:
either you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can place probes and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, so as not to cut the support that holds the anus, and feces come out there involuntarily; then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that cover and clean it since it is cut near the anus, either by probe or other pointed instrument; then clean that foul flesh in the wound as much as you can;
then work to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula in the part away from the anus: it will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes there are fistulas like this: and it is when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is on the side of the anus near the skin above, then take a probe pierced at the end in this form: And insert a twisted thread into it, and insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it is at the end.
If it is piercing in the margin of the anus inside, then pull the thread from that hole, as you insert your finger into the anus;
and pull the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and tie them tightly, and leave it for one or two days;
and tighten it sometimes, until the thread cuts through the flesh that is between them, and they fall;
then treat the wound until it is healed and closed.
If the fistula does not pierce, make it pierce in all the ways you can, if it is not too deep.
Because it is not necessary to cut too deep for the ligature, and then treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
The form of the sharp spatula with which the fistula is cut is very sharp on one side, and cutting; and not on the other side, so as not to cut what should not be cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: they are either inside the anus, like grains of resin, and some are small and large, and blood always flows, and there is one or several, and they are outside the anus and at the top of the anus; but those that are outside have little moisture,
and always ooze a little yellowish water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them inside the anus is to instruct the patient to strain to go to the bathroom, until the anus comes out, and the hemorrhoids appear; so hurry, and grab it with forceps, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the forceps cannot hold them because of their moisture, grab them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of camel hair; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle hot powders on them in place of cautery; or you cauterize them as mentioned in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the anus cannot come out, give the patient a biting and sharp clyster to wash what is in the anus, so it can come out clearly;
when the patient strains, and the hemorrhoids come out of the anus, the treatment is easy; it is to grab them with your fingernail or forceps, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and he fears the incision by iron.
So you must administer the suture in this manner: take a twisted thread, and insert it into a needle, then pull the thread through and pierce the needle on the other side, and twist the two ends of the thread under the needle, and it should be wide; and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and pull the needle, and do the same for all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or wax, and place it on the anus, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall, and when they have fallen, treat them with ointment and other treatment, until they are healed.
Of the drying of feces in the anus Many times the drying of feces happens in the intestine, and by constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use.
So you must scrape the top with the point of a spatula or your fingernail, which does not let it soften; then treat it until it is healed as it should be;
and if it cannot heal, then start the scraping stronger than before, until it bleeds a lot, and is skinned; then treat it until it is healed.
Of tremor Formice is a small foul appearance around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it is found cold, and it is felt like death tremor, and it comes in the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is to take a quill of a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that quill on the tremor, so that the circles take the tremor all around; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the tremor, and put it deep, and scrape the tremor from its roots.
And if you want, do this with a brass or iron quill in this form, and it should be fine below and pulling above:
not piercing, for better holding to the finger, and better pressing. And if you want, cauterize the tremor, as mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
Of the form of the clyster Sometimes one makes a clyster from silver or brass, or cast or hammered bronze; and sometimes these instruments are made small and large, according to those to whom they are administered.
Those that are administered for the treatment of children and who are weak and painful are small.
The shape of the small and large clyster is wide at the top, where the body is tied in this manner:
and it has a separation where the body is tied, as you see, and the lower part is pierced inside; and it has two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the body where the medicines are placed is made of an animal bladder or parchment, and is pierced all around with small holes,
and has between each hole a finger's width of space, then insert in these holes a strong thread twisted ten or fifteen times around, and assemble the body like a goatskin; and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster; and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or a similar thing, then insert it gently;
then the administrator presses it with both hands together, until it is completely empty, then withdraw the clyster, and raise the patient's legs to the wall,
and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it as long as possible; and if he sleeps with it overnight, it is more helpful.
And if you administer the clyster in the disease of diarrhea, and the medicine rushes to come out, repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the anus, or an abscess, the clyster should be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster on which the leather is tightened:
Of wounds
We have already mentioned in the division the treatment of wounds; now we will tell you the treatments by hand and by medicine, according to the fulfillment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to how they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and by what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with a sword and a knife, or a lance or wood or an arrow, or similar things;
or they are made according to the places of the body, like wounds that fall on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the treatment of each wound, and will start with the simple head wounds, for the reminder will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, be careful if it is from a stone throw or similar things, and the skin is still torn and the wound is large, and you fear the development of a hot abscess: then immediately make it bleed from the cephalic vein especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the injured part;
and avoid the patient's overconsumption of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be reduced, and he should not drink any wine, nor eat any meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess develops, cotton soaked only in rose oil, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood, and it is not altered by the air, a powder, which I will describe a little later;
and if the burn has altered it, apply some ointments, until it is healed.
And if the wound is large as from a sword cut and similar, and the lips cannot be brought together by probes, then join them by stitching, as I will describe for the wounds of the abdomen, in the suturing.
If the wound is exposed to the bone, and hangs, and holds only a little, then cut it; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of the skin, and instruct the patient to eat heavy foods, like heads and cooked wheat, as well as pulses, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, then cut out all the rot, and discard it, then treat it;
and if there is an artery in the wound or a vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it dislodged, then tie it with a thread; and if that does not help, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is easy: and it is to put in this powder that seals before the burn has altered it.
And the composition of the powder is: take one part incense; two parts dragon's blood; three parts quicklime, and grind it finely, and fill the wound, and press it firmly, until it is well ventilated and joined with its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it without untying, if it does not swell; because the medicine is not removed until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with just quicklime, when incense or dragon's blood is not available, but the burn has not altered the wound.
And if the burn has altered the wound, especially in summer, then do not use this powder;
but apply some digestive ointments, or barley flour poultices made with water and honey, until it expels pus; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if the fracture of the bone comes with the wound, and it is small, extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you later about the fractures of the head.
Of the wound of the neck
If a wound comes to the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and that of the head, but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy but to leave it untreated, and not to apply anything constricting, because it harms the nerves and makes them retract; and do not apply anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is with the brain, which is the highest member;
but the medicine should be gentle, like lime washed in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and cucia washed also in sweet water, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is hollow and full of pus, pierce it in a lower place;
and if the artery is cut, and blood flows from it, open it, tie it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the gullet, and the passage through which food goes is preserved, then sew the gullet over the pipe of the throat, and do not touch the throat but put it back according to its natural shape; and then bind it appropriately, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, look for it; and if there are pieces of bone, pull them all out if you can, and those you cannot get, leave them until the wound rots, and it is separated and the exit is relieved;
and if the wound is fresh, sprinkle on the powder I mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and there is a fistula, treat it as I have described in its chapter.
Of the wound from a lance or knife
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, see if air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: know then that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with its blood, do not put the powder on it in the first hour, nor bind it for the blood to not stay deep, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture,
and make the patient sleep on the wound for three days, or four, or more; so there will be no spasm, nor trembling of the heart nor difficulty in breathing; and when you see good signs, know that the wound is safe. Then treat it with probes and other remedies, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and it works, know then that there is a fistula; treat it as it should be.
And if the wound is from an incision of a sword or knife, and it is simple, or on the chest or back, treat it as described above;
if it is large, with stitching; and if it is small, with powder, and if it is pressed into the bone, and there are broken pieces, seek the wound, and pull them out if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound rot, so the extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other members, the judgment is as we have said.
Regarding the rupture of the abdomen
The rupture of the abdomen can be large, medium, or small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines or the nerves of the intestines protrude, causing their prolapse;
and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one,
because it is harder to put the intestines back in, unless done immediately; because the intestines swell as soon as they feel cold, making it harder to return them,
and this is why the medium wound is often better, because the intestines are easier to reposition than in the other two.
And know that the rupture of the abdomen can occur in four ways:
the two common stitches happen in the sewing of the abdomen,
and the stitching of other body wounds and two other specific stitches are common for other wounds;
yet they are more appropriate for the stitching of the abdomen, and I will describe each and explain.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine protrudes, and it is difficult to put it back, it is due to one of two reasons: either because of the small size of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way: wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water, or you boil squinant (wormwood), cypress, and spike (lavender) in water, and pour it over the intestine until the swelling is reduced;
and sometimes restraining wines are used, which are better than plain water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water where althea (marshmallow) and mallows have been boiled, because this eases the reinsertion a little;
and if it cannot enter, slightly enlarge the wound with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, as no one should cut without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for the incision:
it cuts inside the curve but not outside, and here is the shape:
And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, put it back according to its natural shape in its proper place, if you can, because it is very beneficial.
When the wound is large, and it is on the lower part of the abdomen, it is necessary to make the patient lie on their back, and place their legs higher than their head; and if it is on the lower part of the abdomen,
and similarly if the rupture of the abdomen is in one of the two parts pay attention to make the injured part higher than the other;
and thus manage what I say for large and medium wounds.
In small wounds apply what you have prepared,
then have a compassionate assistant who holds the whole rupture in his hand, and bring the edges together; and this is the common method of stitching,
and this is the common method of stitching, and it is that you take a needle or several, according to the size of the wound, then leave a finger's width from the edge of the wound, and insert a needle with a strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the membrane (siphac),
then tie a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring the two edges of the wound neatly together,
and then leave a finger's width and insert another needle; then tie it with the thread as you did with the first needle, and continue doing this as necessary with the needles, until the whole wound is closed;
and the needles should be medium-sized, between fine and thick, because fine needles cut all the flesh, and too thick needles cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too much outside the flesh and skin,
so that they do not cut and open the wound before healing;
then cut the heads of the needles so that they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and place tents or cloths on the heads of the needles to keep them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles suffice.
The second stitch is common, and it is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the siphac with one needle with a strong medium thread; and when you have pierced all four edges together,
and when you have pierced all four edges together, then bring the needle back to the part where you started, as you sew cloth;
and leave a space between each stitch the size of a small finger;
this stitch is known by people,
and I sewed a wound that a man had on his abdomen,
which was caused by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm in size, and two palms of intestines were protruding,
and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen. I put the intestine back after it had been out for 24 hours,
and the wound healed within 15 days, and I treated it, and he recovered.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle;
and I did not treat him with ointment, because I was in a place where none were available, nor any medicines; and I only placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you about the two specific ways of stitching:
take the needle, and insert it from the outside part to the inside;
when it has pierced the heart straight through, leave the head of the siphac where you inserted the needle,
and make it pierce from the inside to the outside;
and the idea of this stitch is that you sew as the furrier does with skins, and that you leave the siphac on one side once, and take it on the other, until the stitch is completely done.
The second manner of stitching, which Galen specifically mentions,
is like some do, who join the two parts together naturally, and they apply one end of the siphac to the other end, in this manner:
insert a needle at the nearest point of the wound, and pierce only that place, and leave the two ends of the siphac; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, with the two ends of the siphac;
then make each one pierce from the outside to the inside, on the other side of the wound;
and this is the best and most common manner of stitching.
Galen said this, and some testify,
that one should sew the abdomen with two needles, each with a thread;
and one should insert one needle on one side and the other on the other side, like those who sew belts;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with its blood, before it has changed, then put the intestine back, and sew it; then apply the powder that generates flesh,
then put the intestine back, and sew it; then apply the powder that generates flesh, and if it has changed, then apply any available ointment, until the wound opens; and let the threads fall, and let the siphac and the wound heal; then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed;
and if you do not have medicines, then apply, as soon as it starts to discharge, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
Because you do not need other medicine in many situations when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wound might cause complications to the principal members, then it is necessary to moisten light wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rose oil, and place it around the groin, and under the armpits;
and if there is pain or decay in the bowels, and it often happens, then give them an enema with warm dark wine, especially if the decay reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins there, and the delicacy of the whole body, and its proximity to the nerves.
And if the fat protrudes from the wound, put it back just like the intestine, as long as it is fresh;
and if it is old and has become green or black, it is necessary to tie the place that is black, so that no blood flow reaches it, because there are veins and arteries;
then cut what is between the ties, and place the two hanging ends from the lower part of the wound to the outside to ease the extraction when the fat falls, and the wound opens.
Regarding the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some people,
because I saw a man wounded in the abdomen with a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it festered and became a fistula, and excrement and gas came out;
I treated it as best I could, and did not stop treating it until it was healed, and the place sealed.
And when I saw it heal, I feared that the patient might have pain in his abdomen; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be tied in this way: take ants with large heads, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the ant opens its mouth, place it on the two edges,
then place another ant afterwards in the same way as before, until the wound is completely closed;
and sew the wound. These heads stick to the intestine, and cause no harm to the patient,
and one can tie the intestine with a fine thread made from the intestine of an animal,
in this way: take the end of this intestinal thread that is well cleaned, then tie to the end of this thread a fine twisted linen thread, then thread the needle, and sew the intestine, and return it to the rupture;
and this method of stitching with ants is only used in cases of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is no skill or health, except subtlety.
Regarding fistula wherever it may be Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes old, is universally called "fistula", and especially when it is deep and discharges pus.
And fistula is according to its nature a hardened and white scar tissue, where no pain is felt, and it is as deep as a bird's feather;
and sometimes clear pus comes out, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times a lot;
and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, it is only because of one of the eight causes:
that is, due to the small amount of blood in the body; or because of its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is decayed, and the material is of poor quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is of a pestilential nature; or because in that region digestion is slow, and health is slow, and it swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now I must tell you about the cure of fistula done by manual work.
Know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body; because there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the membrane, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine, or to any joint of the hands or feet;
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to heal, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is a fistula that does not reach the place I mentioned, and you have confidence in the cure, and you want to know it, then take a bronze or iron probe, if the fistula is straight, search it;
and if the fistula is twisted, search it with a fine lead probe, because lead bends well around the twists;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot search it well with probes, then give it an enema through one of the openings,
because the moisture runs from one opening to another, and cleans it;
then search it carefully as best you can, to know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deep,
and ask the patient well about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and where he feels it;
and when you truly know where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places I mentioned, then cut it as I told you,
or in any of the places I mentioned, then cut it as I told you, and remove the scar tissue and the decayed flesh inside; and then treat it until it is healed,
and if the fistula is very deep in the right place, it is necessary to cut it deeply, as much as you can, then put tents soaked in medicine, and insert them to the end of the fistula,
then put tents soaked in medicine, and insert them to the end of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess remaining at the bottom;
then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said,
and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it. If vein or nerve does not hinder you or principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, scrape it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and discharges pus as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom:
so uncover and search until you reach the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is healed this way, it is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; there is no other means but to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with forceps, pull it with an appropriate instrument,
and if there are many bones, pull them all, do not leave even one;
and if the moisture is against you, and there is no error or fear, then cut both the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them in one hour, then apply to the wound something that generates decay, and leave it until the place is decayed around the bones,
and then the bones will be easier to extract;
and if it is a large bone, like from the leg or thigh, scrape only the corruption until all the blackness is removed, then restore the wound;
and if there is a large part of the corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; it is necessary to saw and cut until the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that occurred to a man on his leg, so that you may take example and help in your work.
He was a young man around 30 years old, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from inside the body,
until the substances came to the leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external cause to open;
but the doctors by their folly opened the abscess, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many doctors treated it for about two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of hands,
until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines used to treat him, and what flowed through the openings with great force; and the young man's body was becoming red, and he had a yellowish color.
I placed a probe in one of these openings, and then searched all the openings,
and I found that one came against the other from all parts of the leg.
I then hastened, and cut in one of the openings until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption reached the bone inside;
I sawed what appeared to be the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, except what I removed;
and I began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then I started again, and uncovered the bone as before,
and found the corruption continued in the bone, and I sawed it, and then removed it, and tried to heal the place;
but I could not until I cut around a palm of the bone, and pulled it out with its marrow, then restored it with medicines; and it healed and sealed quickly,
and did not need to restart the work except for the weakness of the patient, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. Because due to the evacuation he often cried, but he was completely healed,
Because due to the evacuation he often cried, but he was completely healed, and a hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition and had no harm or contradiction at all, neither in walking nor in coming.
and stretch the end, so that you pull the corrupted flesh below, and uncover the flesh over the place where you want to saw, so that the saw does not hurt the flesh; and place a splint or a board under the bone to cut the corrupted flesh; and it is necessary to saw as long as one can see and feel the corruption, and saw again another time.
And if the bone is corrupted, and not visible, and the corruption is in the middle or in one part, then uncover all the flesh; then place a splint under,
and then saw from one part to the other the corruption, and let the sawing be a little longer than the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and saw the bone where it connects on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the connection of the two joints, there is no other way but to cut;
and if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand, or the ankle of the foot, it is very difficult, but nevertheless it is necessary to inquire about the corrosion, how it appears; and clean it in all the ways you can, but make sure the veins or nerves do not contradict you;
and know that the cutting instruments and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the setting of the bones and the appearance of the bones, and their thickness and delicacy, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and therefore it is necessary to prepare the appropriate instrument for each kind of work;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the kinds of diseases; so consider the instrument you need according to what is required.
Regarding gangrene The flesh rots either due to an internal cause or an external cause;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicines, and it does not improve, it is necessary to cut that member up to the place where the corrosion reaches, so that the patient escapes death, or the greater harm, which is the loss of the member;
so that the patient escapes death, or the greater harm, which is the loss of the member; and the signs are that the member becomes black, as if it were burnt by fire, and rots after blackening, then the corrosion goes from member to member, and spreads throughout the body; so hurry to cut,
and if it is due to the bite of some venomous creatures, like sea scorpion and viper and similar,
if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not allow it to spread to the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow; and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no treatment helps except the amount of its strength;
and do the same when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, cut it after the next joint;
and if it comes to the foot, cut the whole foot; and if it goes up the leg, cut at the knee joint;
and if it goes above the knee, there is no other means but to leave the patient to die;
and the manner of cutting or sawing the member is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant stretches one tie downwards, and another assistant the other tie upwards, and you separate the flesh between the two ties to a spatula's width, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or saw it, and place a linen cloth on each side, so that the saw does not touch the healthy place, and does not cause another lesion and hot abscess to the patient.
And if blood flow comes when you work, cauterize the place quickly, or apply some restraining powders; then return to your medicine until it is complete,
then tie the wounded member with an appropriate bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you what happened to a man with his foot:
he had a blackness that seemed like a burn from fire,
and that corrosion first came to his toe, until it covered the whole foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut the foot, and was healed;
and long after the corrosion returned to his finger, and he came to me,
and I applied repellent things after cleaning the body, and the corrosion could not be stopped;
and he wanted me to cut his hand, and I did not want to, as I hoped to repel the matter; and I also feared that if I cut his hand, he would die, because the man's strength was weak; and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut his hand, and was healed;
and I have told this story so that others may do the same, if needed.
Sometimes an abscess occurs in a fleshy place, and stays so long that it gathers a lot of pus; and then it bursts and pierces, and the pus comes out, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above it is as thin as a delicate cloth, and it does not reach the bone, nor the nerve, and such a disease is called "sain" (healthy),
but if it is so prolonged that it reaches the bone deeply, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you cut around that skin, and especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not adhere because of its corruption.
And if you are confident that the skin will adhere, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, then treat it with a poultice like this:
see if the abscess is large, and the pus that comes out is of a foul odor, then treat it with Egyptian medicine made like this: take garlic, and oil, and litharge, equally, and put them to cook in a vessel on the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take as much as needed, and melt it in water and honey, and treat the abscess, and tighten the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this many times, until the abscess is clean, and the odor is gone;
and sometimes it is treated with lye water, when this medicine is not available, and it is that you take ashes from vine wood, and pour water over them,
then strain it, and use it as a poultice, until you know the abscess is well cleaned;
and if the patient cannot endure it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the lye water, then treat it with water and honey where a little crushed litharge is added; or treat it with honey and mixed wine, as honey has the property to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes the abscess adhere;
and when you have done this, and you are confident that the abscess is well cleaned, then treat it with what makes flesh grow in it,
and it is that you take a plaster of diafinit, and melt it with rose oil and in wine; or treat it with some medicines and ointments, whose properties I have mentioned in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the abscess is small, and the tube of the poultice cannot enter, then widen it a little with an iron, and insert a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment, until it is widened;
and if the wound is too wide, then sew it and leave only one place where the poultice can enter,
and if the opening that discharges pus is above, then cut it to a lower place. Because when the pus is deep, it does not let flesh grow there; and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare in such a way that the pus flows to the lowest place it is,
and if you cannot cut the abscess below as you wish, then prepare in such a way that the pus flows easily down, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put on the abscess,
and spread a linen cloth over it that covers the whole abscess; then cut with scissors at the opening of the abscess a little wider than the first, then spread a gentle ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it on the opening of the abscess to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except once after many days;
and the one that is on the opening of the abscess, remove often to remove the pus, and know what flows from the pus, if it is venom or little or much, or digested, or undigested;
and take note if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not,
and when your medicine has been spread in this way and you see the nature rising on the opening of the abscess, then know that the abscess is adhering, and health is approaching;
and then untie it in the morning, or the third day, and when you untie the wound, then change to another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if the abscess discharges undigested pus after many days, know that the abscess is not adhering. And if subtle venoms flow after a long time, do not despair of health,
because health is approaching. Because there are men whose flesh growth in their wounds is delayed, and those who do the opposite;
and if undigested pus comes out of the abscess after many days, know that the abscess is not adhering;
and if the abscess is slow to adhere, and is prolonged, then add drying medicines moist in substance and dry in virtue, like diafinit ointment, because it has a large part of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
take diafinit ointment, and melt it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with old wine equally;
then confit it and use it; and the same does well-cooked honey, when diafinit ointment is not available,
or take myrrh and aloe and incense, and grind it, and powder it on the honey when it is on the fire; and then glue a cloth, and spread it on the abscess, and sometimes administer aristolochia, and roots of celestial lily, which is like flour of vetches and centaury;
and roots of celestial lily, which is like flour of vetches and centaury; and use it in simple or compound forms: grind them, and make powder, and put it on the honey as I said, and use it; and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment,
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and affects the bone, or the hard members, or the joints; then treat it as a fistula, as we have said before.
Regarding the abscess of the nail
Panaris is an abscess that arises under the nail of the finger, or the foot, or sometimes arises on other fingers;
and when it becomes old, and is not noticed, a hot abscess develops, and runs and discharges pus until it affects the root of the nail, and sometimes affects the whole nail;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, causing foul-smelling pain, and the tip of the finger becomes large, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, it is necessary to cut with iron all the excess that remains of the nail, then cauterize the wound afterward. The cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses the flesh inside, and begins to prick, and injures it, it is necessary to put a splint under the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove everything;
And if the corrosion is in the bone, cut it, and pull it out, because as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupting, cut it at one of the joints as previously mentioned, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is bruised, and swollen, and it feels great pain, it is necessary to bleed it first; then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across the top,
and ensure that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, because the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, apply something that soothes.
The additional finger that grows on the hands of some people is sometimes all flesh, and sometimes it has bones, and sometimes it has a nail,
and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or the birth is in some joints of the fingers. Those that grow on a joint of the finger do not move, and those that grow at the joint of the finger, sometimes move;
the cutting of the one that is all flesh is easy, in this manner: cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
Those that grow at the root of the joint are difficult to treat: avoid cutting.
For those that grow at the last joint, it is necessary to first cut the flesh roundly to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable saw, then treat it until it is healed.
The fusion that comes to the fingers together comes by birth, or by fusion of the wound, or by burn, or by similar things.
It is necessary to cut that fusion, so that the fingers return to their natural shapes; then put between them tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not fuse; or place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as necessary.
If the fusion comes to any of these fingers with the palm, cut that fusion as necessary.
Of the veins
Vis are large veins enveloped and full of melancholic excesses, which occur in various parts of the body;
and they occur more in the legs of those who walk and work and carry loads, than in others.
It is therefore necessary that you sometimes administer purgatives for bile, and then treat it with basilica (a type of medicinal herb).
The treatment with iron is done in two ways: one is to cut them and draw out the black blood; and the other way is to lift the vein and draw it all out.
The cutting is done in this manner: first pour very hot water on the leg, until the thick blood is thinned, then squeeze the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee; then cut the vein in one place, or two or three, with a wide cut,
then elevate and draw out the black blood by hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood flows as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then tie it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The lifting is done in this manner: shave the patient's leg if there is much hair, then put him in a bath, and pour hot water on his leg until it turns red and the veins swell;
and if you don't have a bath, heat it by the fire, and then cut along the vein from the top of the knee, or the part below at the ankle;
then open the skin with the hook, and strip the vein on each side, until it appears when touched;
and it looks red and black, and when it enters the skin it looks like a white cord;
then put the hook underneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then hang it lightly with the hook,
then cut it in another place about three fingers up; then strip the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the hook as you did before, and hang it on another hook, as you did the first time;
then cut another incision, or more if needed, then lift it, and cut it at the toe of the foot,
then draw and lift it to the second incision; then extract it from cut to cut, until it comes all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot draw and lift it, insert a needle with a strong double thread, and tie and draw it, and place a hook underneath, and turn your hand one way and the other, until it comes out; and be careful it does not break, because if it does, it cannot be drawn or lifted, and it harms the patient;
and when you have drawn it all out, place wool soaked in wine and rose oil on the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is twisted and entangled together, and it is not straight, as we have said, it is necessary to cut it crookedly, but not cut it; and draw it as we have said before.
it is necessary to cut it crookedly, but not cut it; and draw it as we have said before. The shape of the iron used to cut the vein is curved, and does not cut unless it cuts the vein;
and it is of a large curve, because if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but it should be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
Of the civil vein
This vein occurs in the legs, in hot areas where no grass or trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and it sometimes appears elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens due to decay that comes under the skin,
just as snakes and worms come within the body, generated between skin and flesh.
And the signs of the beginning of this vein are that it comes in the leg with a very great inflammation, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like a root of a plant.
When the head appears, it is necessary to wrap around a piece of lead of one and a half Ð— to two Ð—, and tie it,
and let the lead hang on the leg, and every time a point comes out, wrap it around the lead, and tie it; and if it is too long, cut a part, and wrap the rest, and do not cut it at the root, until it is all out; because if you cut it, it reenters the flesh, and causes an abscess and decay in the place, and bad disease;
for which reason it is necessary that it be drawn little by little to the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when drawn out, is five palms long, or ten, and a man once came to me, whose vein was ten palms long, and when you cut it, put a hook in the opening, and pierce it to the bottom,
so that it all comes out; and let the matter inside be emptied, and administer medicines generating decay for a few days, then treat it as abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or on the foot, and many openings appear, from which branches come out; treat it then as we have said before.
Worms that grow between the skin and flesh
This disease is called in our land "cattle disease", because it often happens to oxen,
and it is a small worm that is born between skin and flesh, and goes throughout the body, rising and descending, and one can feel it moving from limb to limb, until it tears the skin where it goes, and comes out;
and it is generated from the decay of some humors, just as worms, serpents, lumbrici, and ascarides come in the stomach;
and one fears its malice, because when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and comes to the eye, sometimes it reenters and destroys the eye; and this happens often.
When you want to cure and draw it, you can only do it when it moves:
so it is necessary to tie the place above and below with a strong tight band,
then cut above and draw it out, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, cauterize it with fire on top, until it dies;
and the greatest harm it does is that it affects the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, press the eyebrow strongly below it, then cut above and draw it out;
and it is necessary to treat the patient with body purifying medicines for the rotten humors,
and avoid foods that generate decay.
Pain that comes from flatulence This disease is called "vakirir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes in some members, and then moves from member to member; and I saw what I tell you.
I was called to a sick woman, and she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm;
and a little later, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain left that place, and fixed itself in the shoulder,
and then a little later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me it kept turning around her body, as I saw.
I marveled greatly at how it moved from member to member, for I had never seen this disease in this manner. However, I had seen many who had seen pain move from place to place, but I had never seen it as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a dry body, and exposed veins, and because of that appeared this constrained windiness;
and it does not appear this way in those who are delicate, and have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you want to cure this disease, and the patient feels that pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then tie it above and below quickly, and then cut above so that the constrained windiness in the place comes out; and cauterize the place; and if you do not see it with your eyes,
then treat it with what expels windiness, such as fetid pills, and serapinum pills, and similar others.
Of the arrows
Arrow wounds are diverse, according to their appearances and the places on the body where they fall.
The diversity among them is that some have large points, small, barbed, and welded; and some have two angles, and others that are long, and some with pieces; and those that fall in any member do so in two ways: either in a principal member,
such as brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it falls in any place of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you hereafter, appear to you: it is necessary to avoid extracting this arrow, for death comes afterward in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deep, then draw it, and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow falls there and pierces the bone, and the membrane over the brain comes out, are when there is dizziness and sudden pain and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of mind, and vomiting of bile; and sometimes blood comes out of the nostrils, or the ears; and sometimes speech and voice are lost; and white moisture resembling pus comes out of the wound, and also a spray of flesh;
and if these signs appear to you, avoid the cure, and draw the arrow if it is not inside.
The signs of the arrow when it falls in the heart are that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it is stuck in something hard, not empty; and sometimes the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and syncope: know then without doubt that death is coming.
And the signs of the arrow that injures the lung are that blood full of foam comes from the wound, the throat swells, the patient changes color, and breathes heavily and seeks cool air.
And if the arrow falls in the covering of the chest, it is near the small ribs; and causes heavy breathing and great pain and sighing; and all the shoulder muscles move.
And if the arrow falls in the stomach, sometimes some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls in the abdomen, and feces come out through the torn intestine, there is no hope in the cure, nor in the extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls in the bladder, and urine flows out and comes externally, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other members, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, auxiliary muscles, spine, buttocks, thigh, and legs, and similar members, are safe according to many conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do the same.
It happened to a man that an arrow fell into the tear duct at the root of the nose: I probed it, and drew it from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I drew an arrow from a man whose arrow fell into the fat of the eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow was embedded, and I could only reach the point towards the shaft, and the arrow was large from a Turkish bow, with a light iron head without barbs; the man was healed, and no bad accidents occurred.
And I drew an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with barbs:
I sawed off the barbs, and worked carefully until I drew it, and the Christian was healed.
And I drew an arrow from a man, who had it fall into his abdomen, and I thought he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, his condition did not change; I cut above the arrow, and manipulated it, and drew it out, and no bad accident occurred.
And I saw a man whose arrow fell into his back, and the wound was sealed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions, and found no harm in any of his natural functions.
And I saw another man, whose arrow fell into his face, and the wound was sealed over;
and it remained thus without great pain; and many other similar cases.
And I drew an arrow from one of the king's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and was slightly inclined to the right side; and the arrow was fully embedded
I was called to the treatment after it had fallen for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; and he felt pricking and pain under his right ear. I thought it was from the point of the arrow
I applied a drawing and digesting plaster on the place, so that it would not swell; and the place of the arrow appeared.
and the place of the arrow appeared. I applied the plaster for several days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained thus for a long time,
until he felt the arrow one day in his nose; and he told me. I applied corrosive liquid medicine on the wound for several days, until it was open,
and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrow that was stuck in the place; then I added the liquid medicine in the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow appeared visibly;
and about four months passed,
and then the wound widened enough that I inserted the forceps, and moved it one way and the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not stop working carefully and manipulating with various instruments, until one day I took it with well-made forceps, according to its shape that will come at the end of this chapter, until I drew it out, and restored the wound.
And the doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was sealed, and the patient was completely healed.
Now I have told you the quality of extracting some arrows, so that you apply your treatment to what I do not say, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master can infer great things from very little, and from what is present and lacking, find new works, and new instruments, to deal with strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not come out of the members where they are stuck except in two ways: either through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that comes out through where it enters is an arrow entering fleshy places, and sometimes comes out immediately.
And if it does not come out immediately, leave it until the flesh around it rots, and the exit is easier;
and also if it is stuck in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it thus for some days, and move it each day;
and then it will come out, and if it does not, pierce around it with a fine drill, until the place around it is widened, and then draw it.
And if the arrow is embedded in a place of the body where it cannot be seen, probe for it with a probe; and if you feel it, draw it with an appropriate instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve or vein, cut it until the wound is large; and draw the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds,
and draw the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, remove the flesh that is stuck on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can draw it;
and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow, until you can draw it; and work carefully not to break the arrow, or it will be much harder to draw it.
And if you cannot at once, leave it until the place around is rotten, then draw it, because the extraction will be easier. And if the blood flow hinders you, administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and the vein, and devise how you can draw the arrow without danger,
whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently; and place the patient as he was when the arrow fell into him, for that is the greatest help, and if you cannot, place him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes out the other way, where something of it appears, or the skin is swollen in the place so that it can be seen or felt clearly:
cut above it then, until the forceps can take hold, and then draw it: so it comes out immediately.
And if it is held in the bone, rotate your hand roundly, until it enters the bone, and widen the bone, then draw it.
And if it cannot come out, leave it again, and then restart the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, push it with the shaft;
and if the shaft falls, and you want to administer pushing, use an instrument with a barbed point, so that the point of the arrow enters the barb of the instrument; then push out,
and if the arrow is barbed, insert an instrument with a point inside, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, it is necessary to cut all the flesh around where the venom is, if you can, then treat the wound as necessary.
And if the arrow falls in the chest or abdomen or bladder or side, and it is near, and you can cut above, then cut there;
and beware of cutting the vein and the nerve, then draw it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps used to draw arrows is like a bird's beak, and here is the shape:
And there are many kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
Of the common veins of the body Of the veins from which bloodletting is done, there are thirty-one, of which sixteen are in the head,
namely: two that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two jugular veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the upper lips, which are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly used for bloodletting are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and it is on the left side, and the lay people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste", and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the lay people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the lay people call it "vein of the belly", and it is on the cubit, and it is the one used for bloodletting, which appears clearly on the forearm.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, and has two branches;
and in the leg and the foot are three veins: one is under the curve of the calf on the left side, and the second is the saphenous which is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein that is called "nesse", which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
The bloodletting of the veins that are behind the ears helps with old catarrh, and migraine; and the quality of the bloodletting, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head,
and the quality of the bloodletting, as I tell you, is that you raise the patient's head, and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then squeeze the patient's neck with a band, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places dependent on the head: find them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, then bleed from there;
then take the lancet, and insert it under the vein to the bone, then raise your hand with the vein upward, and cut both the skin and the vein well for two fingers' breadth, and let as much blood flow as you want;
then compress and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already discussed incision and cauterization in the first book.
The bloodletting of the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for old migraine, and sudden migraine, and chronic eye inflammation, and acute tearing in the eyes;
and the quality of the bloodletting is as I say: and it is that the patient squeezes his neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, then bleed from there;
then lift the skin over the vein upwards with your index finger, and insert the lancet below, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you did with the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then untie the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place cotton on it;
then tie it tightly, and leave it until it is healed; and we have already discussed their cutting and extraction at the beginning of the book.
The bloodletting of the vein of the forehead is as valuable as the bloodletting of the cephalic for old face diseases, and for migraine, and for redness;
and the quality is that the patient squeezes his neck while twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called "fosseur", of which here is the shape:
And place the point on the vein, and strike it with your hand, or something else, and let the blood flow according to the amount you want; then untie the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed and sometimes work with a wide flame.
However, the flame should not be too sharp; and bleed transversely, because the bone is near, and the flame might break when it is thin.
The bloodletting of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps with the eyes, and ringworm, and redness, and stye in the eye, and face diseases;
and the quality of their bloodletting is that the patient squeezes his neck while twisting with a band, as before;
then bleed, and let the bleeding be transverse, a little along with a slightly wide flame, because there is no flesh there.
And if the flame is thin, it might break; then let the blood flow, as much as you need, then tie cotton on it, and tie it well.
The bloodletting of the vein of the nose is good for acute, and sudden frenzy, and face diseases, such as migraine and redness that comes on the face, and especially when it is old;
and the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient squeezes his neck, then squeeze his nose with your left hand, and take the thin long flame, and insert it in the middle of the upper lip in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein does not appear well there, and the blood will start flowing immediately;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your need, then tie it for a night, because it heals very quickly;
The bloodletting of the two jugular veins helps with the narrowing of breath, and the onset of measles, and many diseases, and impetigo, and corrosion, and herpes, and scrofula;
and the quality of the bloodletting is that the patient squeezes his neck below one and the other, as we have said; and the master stands over the patient's head, and the patient sits on a seat,
then bleed the vein lengthwise a little broadly, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as needed;
then do the same to the other vein, then untie the band, and squeeze both veins moderately, so that the patient does not strangle; and leave it until morning, when the wound is healed.
Of the bleeding of the lips The bloodletting of the veins in the upper lips helps with bile in the mouth, and gum decay, and cracks in the lips, and nose and around.
And the quality of the bloodletting is to make the patient sit before you, and squeeze his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, of which one is on the right lip and the other on the left, and recognize them because they are black, and because there are small black veins around them: then cut both, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt,
then cut both, and if you do not know them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and do the same for the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same manner.
Of the bleeding under the tongue The bloodletting of the veins under the tongue helps after the bloodletting of the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and diseases of the uvula, and diseases of the mouth;
and the procedure is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and raises his tongue, and you look under each side for a black vein:
then bleed both, and do not go too deep, because the arteries are below.
The veins of the elbow from which bloodletting is commonly done are treated in two ways:
either by pricking with a broad myrtle flame, or a fine olive-shaped flame like cutting knives, and it is called "anesil"; and they are broad or fine according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the myrtle flame is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And it is used to open swollen veins full of apparent thick blood, and that contain thick and cloudy blood; and here is the shape of the olive flame:
and it is more finely pointed, and is for bleeding fine veins, where there is fine citrine blood.
The bloodletting of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps with diseases that are below the throat, in the neck, in the chest, and in the abdomen;
and it is necessary for the bloodletter to bleed carefully, and to avoid the artery that is below. And if he cuts the artery, and bleeding occurs, it must be stopped, as I have said; and the flame should not be pricking, but cutting like an anesil.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, it is necessary to squeeze it, and change to another; or you seek a branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut it with the anesil flame, as we have said.
And if you want to know the place of the bloodletting, it is necessary before squeezing the arm, to touch the place until you know the pulse; then mark the place with ink, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with the anesil flame;
and beware of hitting the artery when you see the place swelling, because it is from the artery: avoid it then.
And if you see it spurting up like a child's urine, and the blood is red and fine, know that it is arterial blood: then hasten, and place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, which often happens;
then tie the arm, and leave it like this, and do not let the patient move it; and be on guard, and do not let him move it until it is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overwhelms you, and you do not have medicine, then cut the artery if it appears, because the ends will retract; and stop the blood.
And take a piece of pistachio bark, and split it, and take one half and tie it well until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, then treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop bleeding;
and the stopping is not difficult in many situations due to the small place of the wound, and the pressure of the arm band.
The bloodletting of the middle vein helps as it draws blood from the head above, and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and the cephalic, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the bloodletter to avoid the nerve that is below, and if he pricks too deeply, and finds the nerve, and it swells and the healing is difficult, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some people due to its fineness, then it is necessary to bleed it with the anesil instrument; and avoid the nerve as much as you can.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
The bloodletting of the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking with the olive flame or the myrtle flame, because it is the safest of all the veins, as there is neither nerve nor artery below it.
However, it is necessary to seek the lightest place, and it does not matter if one fails the first time, and one tries again; and perhaps the place swells in some people, when one fails the first time, but it does not matter. The quality of the bloodletting is according to your thought.
The first thing you should know about bloodletting is that it is administered only to maintain health,
and to avoid future illnesses; and the bloodletting should be done in one of the three veins that are in the elbow: that is, cephalic, median, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of repletion appear;
and one should bleed on the first or the third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bloodletting that is administered for illnesses has no fixed time, but whenever necessary, day or night, at all hours and at all times;
and children should not be bled until fourteen years old, nor pregnant women except from the fourth month to the seventh. Nor should old people who have passed sixty years old be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary to cleanse the intestines with a light enema, if there is a lot of retained feces, so that the veins do not draw the rotten superfluities from the intestines that harm the principal members;
and one who is too full of food, or who is drunk, until it is out, or hydropic, should not be bled;
and one should avoid bloodletting after colic pain, and vomiting, and diarrhea, and excessive intercourse, and work, and staying awake, and fasting, and anything that exhausts the strength, whether by soul or body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, by food and drinks and medicines, if you have the power;
then enter the bath, if nothing forbids it, to refine the blood,
and bleed yourself from the vein of the arm around the third hour, as we have said;
and avoid work, and pain, and lust, and similar things that day;
and be happy and joyful, and let the bloodletter be higher than the one being bled, and rub his arm two or three times,
then tie the band above moderately, because if it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow;
then rub the place with your hands, until the veins swell, and can be felt;
then the bloodletter moistens the flame with a bit of old oil, then places his left finger on that vein below the place where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not flee and avoid the prick. Because there are veins that flee like cords when being bled, and some that are full of wind, so that when the flame is applied, it retracts the flame, and the vein cannot open, and so it is with those;
and if it opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore it is necessary for the bloodletter to be aware of these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, then try again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, leave it for one or two days, and do not tie the arm: perhaps a hot abscess will come; do not enter the bath, then try the bloodletting again if he likes;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows slowly and you doubt that enough blood will come out, then prick in that same opening with the flame directly;
and open it a little quickly, before the place is swollen; because this often happens when the wound is small.
If you see the place swelling, do not start the bloodletting again, and put on a bit of oil dregs, because it relieves the flow of blood, and in this place the dregs are better than the oil;
and thus administer the oil dregs in each bloodletting when you bleed the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and the same is done by theriac and mud, when applied to the place; it refines the blood and spreads it when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess appears, which often happens, especially when it is not bled except at that time when the vein opening is small, then hasten, and put on the place a sponge soaked in water and a little warm salt, and press it for an hour;
and it is necessary to do this after the flow of blood from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains in the place after a few days, it does not harm him; and if you wish, put on something of aloe or myrrh mixed in the juice of calamint, mustard, or similar.
And many times an abscess and appearance occur with the bloodletting of the basilic vein: then put your hand on it, and if you find the place soft to the touch of the hand, then that appearance is bad. Avoid then putting on anything of what we have said, because perhaps blood will flow from the artery; but make a dry plaster to harden the place, then treat it with another treatment, until it is healed.
And draw blood from each according to the amount of his strength, and the color of the blood.
Because if the blood is black, let it flow until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it is refined; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And for one who is full and strong, and needs bloodletting, make a larger wound, and let the flame be broad;
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and let him be bled little and often, and bleed him by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and cutting the nerve, and is better than longitudinal or broad bleeding.
And for one whose body fails from the bloodletting, give him bread soaked in pomegranate juice; if he is hot, draw blood three or four times.
And if he is of a cold complexion, let him eat before the bloodletting bread soaked in mulled syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints from the bloodletting, after the flow of much blood, it is necessary for him to inhale meat broth, and a subtle scented syrup,
and use the other things we have said in the division or chapter of syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wants to air his arm, and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by great bloodletting, that he be bled little by little, according to the amount of his strength continuously.
And if he wants to air his arm after the first bloodletting, and he has a strong body, let him be bled seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And if he wants to be bled again elsewhere, let him be bled on the second or third day.
Because there is much blood in the body that is already heated, and it causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large amount, and widen the opening until he falls into a faint; then you consider all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse when he faints, so that death does not come in place of fainting, and this often happens, when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not necessary when you want to untie the arm, and make the blood flow a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press firmly on it; nor if it is curved, that he stretches the arm quickly, because that would be harmful;
but leave it until he bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the point of the flame, until the blood that is clotted at the opening of the vein flows out, and put on a bit of salt dissolved in water, and press lightly.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not press it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, bleed in that same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the head vein because it is composed.
And the manner of bloodletting is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the armpit is red;
then tie moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed it immediately across, not lengthwise or breadthwise;
and let the opening be large, and let it be bled very near the joint of the hand, and if the blood cannot flow, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, because it is used more in winter than in summer;
and the bloodletting of this vein is safer than all other veins, as there is no artery or nerve.
The bloodletting of the salvatory vein of the right hand is good for all diseases of the liver, and this is the manner:
squeeze the hand, and put it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so that it is visible; and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely, it does not matter;
and do not go too deep, because the nerves are all exposed without flesh underneath,
and then put the hand back in warm water, if the blood is clotted in the wound, and cannot flow out.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and salt on the vein to close it quickly, and do the same for each branch.
The bloodletting of the same vein in the left hand is good for the disease of the spleen, and do just as I have told you for the right.
The bloodletting of the saphenous vein is good for all diseases that are below the body, such as diseases of the womb, retention of menses, diseases of the kidneys, thighs, and old leg ailments, and similar diseases.
And the procedure of its bloodletting is that the patient puts his foot in warm water, and rubs the vein until it appears, and tie above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and many branches go above the foot;
then bleed the largest branch, or at the ankle, which is very beneficial.
And if you bleed it on the foot, beware of the nerves that are underneath, and bleed it across as if cutting; and let the flame be anesil.
And if the blood cannot flow out, put the foot back in the water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the bloodletter fails the first time, start again a second time a little above, because the place is dirty; and do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bloodletting is good for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the procedure of its bloodletting is that the patient enters the bath, and squeezes above the ankle four fingers' width, twisting,
because otherwise the vein does not appear; and if it appears, bleed it in all the ways you can, and across; and it is much better to cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very well defined in many people.
and it is much better to cut it, because the place is safe, and it is very well defined in many people. And if you cannot find it, bleed any branch of it that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and let as much blood flow as you wish, then untie the band, and put on cotton and press it; it is now healed.
Of bleedings from cupping
Cupping glasses are made of horn, brass, or glass; and cupping is done in two ways: either by pricking and drawing blood, or without pricking.
And this cupping that is without pricking is done in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cup below the chin; and the cups on the two shoulders; and the cup on the loins; and the cups in the middle of the two arms; and the cups on the two legs; and the cups on the two ankles; and cupping does not draw blood, except from the small veins that are scattered in the flesh,
and therefore it does not weaken one, as bloodletting from a vein does; and it is not necessary for it to be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any disease that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if by necessity of diseases it is necessary to cup, or by custom, we will administer it at each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in the middle and at any time;
because there are those who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find repletion and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and dimness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream, and see by night blood and wounded and dead and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we recommend cupping after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting of the scalp helps with the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary for it to be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the bloodletting of the cephalic vein,
and it is not necessary for those who are of a cold complexion to use it, or who have catarrh, because it greatly harms them;
and therefore it is not necessary for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold diseases in the head.
And those who are often bled with it, become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cup a little lower to avoid forgetfulness.
The cupping in the middle of the neck is in place of the bloodletting of the head and the basilic vein, and therefore it is good for the constriction of the chest, and the fissure of the bronchial tube, and cough, and repletion;
and it is necessary to press it lightly, because if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or stomach and heart problems.
The cupping on the two sides of the neck is good for head pains, and ophthalmia and migraine, and strangulation, and pain in the roots of the teeth,
and it is in place of the bloodletting of the basilic vein; and it is necessary to instruct the bloodletter to press his hand when placing it, so that he does not cut the artery, and bleeding does not occur.
The cupping below the chin is good for mouth diseases, and gum corruption, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and it is in place of the bloodletting of the two lips.
The cupping on the shoulders is good for diseases that come from heat and repletion.
The cupping on the elbows is as good as the bloodletting of the three veins of the arm, because it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the bloodletter not to prick too deeply, because the place is bare of flesh, and nerves and arteries are underneath.
The cup on the loins is good for hemorrhoids of the anus, and diseases below, and it is necessary for the cup to be large, and made of brass, because it needs to draw well; and perhaps, if it were fine, it would break; and it makes large wounds.
The cups on the legs bleed openly, because they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains of the kidneys, and the womb, and the bladder, and bring back the menses; and they are in place of the two saphenous veins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause fainting in many situations.
The way to apply the cup is to place it first empty, and suck lightly, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not stop doing this, until you see the place red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears; then prick, and replace the cups, and be careful with the disposition of the bodies, because there are those who have tender flesh, and clear pores: then it is necessary to prick only once, and make large wounds, and a little deep; and suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to prick twice: the first time to refine the way for the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to prick a third time; and when we want to draw a little blood, it is sufficient to prick only once.
And if we want to draw a lot of blood, we repeat often; and if the blood is thick, prick deeply, and the end is that the heart is pierced suddenly,
and it is necessary for one who has thick and hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cups with opening and dissolving oil: if it is in summer, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or gourd seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with watercress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take amaranth oil, or balsamite oil, or dill oil, and the like.
And if the one being bled has tender flesh and large pores, it is not necessary to apply oil,
but it is necessary to wash him after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or nightshade water, or gourd water, or purslane water, or something similar.
And those who have a lot of moisture, rise from wormwood, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities rise from old wine, or elder water, or dill or chamomile decoction, or others similar;
and it is not necessary to bleed with a cup before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours; and do not sleep after the cupping,
and it is necessary to be cautious, when he should be cupped and when he is cupped. And be careful if the one being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; then it is necessary to take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuce with wormwood, and similar things;
and eat chickens, and castrated meat, and moist foods.
And those who have a cold complexion, take honey syrup, and medium-scented wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat chickens and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day he will be cupped, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some people sometimes theriac or nutmeg before cupping, or after, to comfort the principal members; and let the blood be refined, but it is not necessary for those who are hot to drink it.
The cups that are applied without pricking are those that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and on gout, and on the stomach and the abdomen and the kidneys and the hips, because those members do not tolerate pricking well,
and it is only done to draw blood from one member to another, as we place them on the breasts when the nose bleeds; to remove the viscosity that is in the member, as we place cups on the stomach and the abdomen to reduce the member;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or moves the stone from its place;
and so it does when it is placed on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained wind,
and these cups are administered empty to suck only; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes filled with warm water,
as in diseases of pleurisy, and in such a manner that the cup is filled with pure warm water, or water in which herbs suitable for this have been boiled.
The shape of the cup administered with fire is this:
It should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side around the middle a small hole, like to insert a needle,
and it should be of brass, smooth in front so that it does not hurt the patient when placed on the member;
and it should have in the middle a transverse rod of brass or iron, to place a lit candle,
and there should be large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who take them;
because the cups for children are different from those for the old, and for the thin than for the fat.
And one should place this cup on the member in this way:
take the candle of wax or a wick, and place it in the middle of the cup across the rod that is in the middle of the cup, so that the flame is at the bottom of the cup so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the member, and your fingers should be on the hole we mentioned, so that when you want, the vapor goes out, and you remove the cup;
and take the wick as before, and repeat often, if you need to.
In the cup that is administered in disease of pleurisy, with water, there is no rod or hole, and it is only administered when it is full of water, and placed on the member only;
and this is the shape:
Leeches are only administered in members where cups cannot be placed due to their small size, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places bare of flesh, such as fingers or nose, and other similar places;
and the procedure of their use is that when you find leeches in clean fresh water without rot, take them;
and place them for a night in fresh water, until they are hungry, and have nothing in their bellies; and then bleed the vein and the cup, then rub the member until it is red, and place the leeches on;
and when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where you can put a cup, place it, because it is very beneficial after.
If not, clean the place with wormwood, and then with water, very well, and then press it;
and if the place bleeds too much after the leeches, soak a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on, until the blood is stopped;
and if the blood increases, place powdered vitriol, or galls, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or place peeled fava beans on the place, and leave them until they stick to the place, and it will stop immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to attach, rub the place with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until the blood flows, and then place them on, and as soon as they smell the blood, they will attach;
and when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a bit of powdered aloe and salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.
Here begins the book of fractures
This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish doctors avoid this chapter, for they have never seen any of the ancient books nor read any text on this subject;
and for this reason, science is rare in our land, for I have never found anyone good in this field;
and I know nothing of it except through the science of ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have drawn science from them, through experimentation, and by the practice of my life;
and I have already described to you in this chapter what is contained, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments used, just as I have done in these two previous chapters.
It is therefore fitting that we state in the prologue of this book the summaries of the discourse and the chapters where the wise man sets his understanding and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twist or break comes to someone, you must hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, unless something prevents it, such as weakness of the body, or children, or old people;
or if the weather is not too hot or too cold; and he should eat cool foods, that is to say, cold broths, and meat of birds and goat, and not drink wine, nor eat fatty meats, and not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, so that you do not have to worry about hot abscesses or the spreading of matter in the limb; so the patient should return to his previous diet that he has used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that provide thick nourishment, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow tripe, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals much faster.
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal well or fuse according to their nature due to the dryness of their limbs, nor can those that are too tender, like the bones of small children;
but it does not matter, the broken bone forms a thick tendon that surrounds and joins the limb together, strengthening it as before; and it does not lose its function, so it must be nourished with substantial foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are varied in many ways.
For the fracture of the head is different from the fracture of the chest or the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there are fractures that are splintered, and others that are sharp, like the cut of a writing pen.
For there are fractures that are splintered, and others that are sharp, like the cut of a writing pen. And there are fractures with a wound, and fractures with just a small crack.
And each type has its method and its appropriate instrument for restoration, according to what memory serves in its place;
and the fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and it is clearly visible from the outside, and it sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound upon touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but it can very well have twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. So you should not move it with your hand, but apply medicines that will be described later, and then gently bind it.
And know that splintered fractures, where the two parts are disjointed, must be immediately set in place evenly before hot abscesses occur;
and if hot abscesses occur, leave it for a few days until the abscesses subside; then set it evenly as much as you can, lightly and wisely, and know that the restoration of it is easier than the restoration of one with pieces; then bind it, as will be described later.
And if the bone has broken pieces, stretch it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and set the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, bring all the pieces back to their places by all means possible, and ensure that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and align the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand to see if it seems not right: if so, adjust it gently, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause hot abscesses and contraction in the limb by their work, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is set, instruct the patient well not to move it, neither while awake nor asleep, nor while turning, nor in any other manner; and ensure that the limb is so secure that it does not feel any pain. For when it feels any pain, it is not set properly, and it needs to be positioned so that it does not feel any pain;
For when it feels any pain, it is not set properly, and it needs to be positioned so that it does not feel any pain; and ensure that it is set straight, so that there is no twisting when it is healed;
and the quality of the broken limb is as I have told you.
Know that broken limbs are varied in size, length, and shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar: they need to be wrapped in soft and fine linen cloths;
and those that are large, such as thighs and legs: they need to be wrapped with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandage embraces the entire large limb and compresses it evenly on all sides, so that there is no flaw;
then bind around it with light tow, three or four times according to the limb, and tighten it a little with your hand with the bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture itself is slightly away from the binding;
and soften the bandage little by little, so that you cover a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and wrap again over the broken place;
then go below the fracture, and bind it moderately, not too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first binding above;
then place between the bandages flax tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind everything with a band, and then place your well-made splints on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something to soothe the hot abscess and reduce the swelling, and leave it for a few days;
then bind over the splints, which should be half of a wide split cane, or made of wood used for stakes, or palm branches, and should be in this shape:
but it is necessary that the splints placed on the fracture are a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be as long as necessary for the size of the limb, whether small or large;
then bind over the splints as you did with the first binding, then bind above with a fitting thread, as with the first binding on the fracture;
tighter at the top, gradually less; and the thread should be moderate, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen the work of fools who make their bindings with twisted linen cords, it is a great error, for the binding cannot be even if it is too thin, and there should be at least a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after binding on healthy areas, then place under them flax tow or teased wool, so that he does not get hurt.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the skin is broken, I will describe its treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all fractured limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints until after five or seven days, or more depending on your certainty of preventing a hot abscess;
and here is the method of the ancient poultices for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it; this is the common method of the poultice for restoring fractures in various conditions, especially for women and small children, as it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of poultice for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take 3 drachms of abareis and ladanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and mastic, each 10 drachms; myrrh and aloes, each 5 drachms; frankincense 9 drachms; and make a powder, mix them with plenty of eggs; if the person's complexion is warm, use this poultice, for it is a good composition, and restores broken bones quickly, and is beneficial for many people.
Another method of poultice for twists: take mastic and mallows, each 10 drachms; myrrh and aloes, each 9 drachms; acacia 6 drachms; Armenian bole 10 drachms, and grind well, mix with water or plenty of eggs, and apply.
Another method of poultice for joints and bones separated from their places, and to soothe the resulting pain, and the cut uses the bone and the fracture: take new wool, soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the area. This poultice does not restore, but it is good for soothing hot abscesses, and properly removes pain.
Another method of poultice that restores broken bones: take dried fig leaves, and leaves of ground ivy, and grind them together, and make a poultice.
Another method of poultice for the restoration of a bone fracture and to reduce the remainder of the abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, each one part; and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is heated, mix it with coriander water or plain water, and apply.
Another method of poultice, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, linseed, pomegranate flowers, melilot, and elderflowers, and violet flowers and chamomile, each one part; and grind, and mix with saltwater or fresh water, or with wine, depending on the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not place on the broken limb for restoration anything other than a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen suggests that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another method of poultice that is good for injuries and pain: take mastic and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and salt equally, and grind them, and make a poultice and apply it.
And then untie it a little later, and see if the patient does not feel any pain, and the bone has not moved from its place; if so, do not untie it for several days
And if pain comes to the area, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hasten and untie it, and remove the poultice immediately; and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and clean the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened with water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure of preventing a hot abscess;
and relieve the inflammation of the limb, and remove the pain, then restart the subtle binding, and a little poultice, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and refine it until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling are already gone, and you need poultice and bandage, then restart it, just as you did at first equally.
And if none of what we said occurs to the limb, do not untie it until after three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what is seen, until the fracture heals, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then bind it tighter than before, and enrich its nourishment, as I said earlier; and if you see the area drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it; then moisten it with warm water every time you untie it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the binding a little;
thus the nourishment will flow to the limb, and quickly correct what the foolish doctors do, who restore the limb crookedly: this is bad, and such work is dangerous, and I see no other way than to bind and work it properly.
of the various types of fractures There are many kinds of fractures, and various shapes, and the causes are distinct;
for there are fractures caused by sword strikes, where the blow removes all the bone down to the membrane beneath the bone, like an axe or a club; and for this reason, this type of fracture is called "hack".
Or the sword cuts the bone on the surface without piercing it, and this type of fracture is called "absolute"; and the wound from these two fractures can be large or small.
And if there is a blunt impact, or a crack from a blow from a stone, or from falling onto a stone, or similar incidents.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which approaches the membrane beneath the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound can be large or small.
And if there is a wound that is visible on the bone as fine as a hair, and the crack is small, and for this reason, this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound is made by striking with a stone, or by falling, or similar incidents, and it causes a piece of bone to enter, and the place is dented as potters do when they strike the pots; so the stone enters inside.
And this happens more often to those who have soft bones in the head, like the heads of children;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like splinters; and I will speak of this in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the detraction on them, and the investigation with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is on them.
The capillary fracture is known by the fact that when the bone is uncovered, and one rubs ink on it, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fractures, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting bile, loss of consciousness, convulsions, fainting, high fever, and the eyes bulging and reddening, and other similar symptoms in various forms, then it cannot heal without doubt.
And if you do not see any frightening symptoms, and you hope for healing, then start the treatment.
And when the injured person first comes to you, and it is winter, you should remove the bone before the fourteenth day if you can.
And if it is summer, then hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone is corrupted, and the symptoms we mentioned occur.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, you must split the fractured part like this: take the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone in any way you can, and on the shape of the wound as gently as you can,
and if bleeding occurs when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, then help it with what is needed, which is to fill the area with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess is soothed, and you are sure the bleeding has stopped; then start to remove the bone around, and this is done according to two methods: one method is to cut narrowly in front, and this is the form:
And then make another cut larger than the first.
And the second method is to have a number of different cuts, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and made of hard iron; and work gently, so you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it before you make cuts with drills, but not too deep so they do not pierce through the bone of the head, and the drill must have a rim or a circle above the point, to prevent the point from passing through the bone; and you must have several, so that each one matches the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all heads; and these are the forms of the three types of drills:
The method for piercing around the broken bone is to place a drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is pierced; then place the drill a little further along, and do this all around, then cut with incising tools the thickness of the bone that is between the holes, and do this as delicately as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you extract the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments you have such as tongs, pincers; and be careful not to touch the brain or the membrane.
And when you have pierced the bone and extracted it, you must then scrape off the remaining roughness of the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other incising tools;
and if any small pieces of bone remain, or any scales, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with the probes and ointments we have mentioned.
And the other method of work is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and he praises it highly, and this is his word. First you must uncover part of the bone, where the fracture is most apparent, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the form:
And it does not cut on one side, and the sharp part is on both sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone; then strike with a small mallet on it, so that you cut lightly around the bone, and be very careful of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it gently, for it can be removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not pierce the membrane, and the bone is only cut on the surface, and there are small pieces, you must smooth the roughness, and remove the scales with a delicate scraper of which you should have various sizes, to use in each place the most suitable one, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So start with large scrapers, and then more delicate ones, and continue this until it is smooth.
In each of the other capillary cuts and fine fractures, you must administer treatment according to its alignment; and this is something that is not hidden from one who has studied this art.
And if the membrane is uncovered, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it with rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth folded in two or three, and moisten it with wine and rose oil, and place it on the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can, so you do not harm the membrane, then apply another bandage over it, and do not bind it too tightly, just enough to hold the wound;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the hot abscess is soothed, then untie it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, vetch flour, incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things; and make a powder of these things, and apply it to the wound, and always apply cleansing medicines without causing pain;
and make sure the wound is always clean, do not leave the ointment on it, nor let any dirt gather on it, for when dirt gathers on the membrane of the brain, it corrupts and rots it, and causes great harm to the patient; for when something irritating is placed on the membrane, it blackens on the surface.
Be careful then, if any bad symptoms occur to the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly dangerous.
And if blackening occurs only because of the medicine applied, which has such a property, then take one part honey, and three parts rose oil and soak a cloth in it, and place it on the membrane; then treat it with the appropriate methods of treatment, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or only one part, for these are two bones; and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, it only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must place your little finger in the nostril, and align the fracture inside with your index finger, and with your thumb from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and make sure the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger cannot reach the place, then you must align it with the end of a somewhat thick stick.
And if the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess is soothed, then place tents of linen cloth at the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part.
Or place another on the other side, if the fracture is there; and the tents should be large enough to fill the nostrils.
And some restorers say the tents should be moistened with butter, and changed every day. This does not seem right to me, but they should be moistened with a mixture of egg white and flour dust; then leave the tent, until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose instead of tents, and there is a soft cloth around, and the fracture holds, and the patient breathes through it; now do whichever you prefer.
And if a hot abscess occurs in the nose while you are working on it, apply wax or cotton moistened with rose oil, or a little of diaculum.
And if a hot abscess does not occur, apply a poultice externally, made of sesame flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then place light tow on it, and do not bind the nose;
and if the fracture of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with suitable instruments, then sew the crack, and treat it with things that generate flesh and heal, such as poultices and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and place lead tubes, until it is healed.
of the fracture of the jaw
When the jaw is broken below, and there is no wound outside, and the fracture is only external, and it is not broken into two, only curved inside, it is easily recognized.
If the fracture is on the right side, you must place your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, place your index finger of the right hand, and gently align the fracture inside, and adjust it with the other hand from outside, and set it evenly.
And if the fracture of the jaw is separated into two, you must apply traction from both sides, until it is even.
And if the teeth are dislodged, or broken, bind them with a thread of gold or silver or silk, then place wax on the broken jaw, and apply a double cloth; and place on the cloth a large, well-made splint, or a piece of leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it as best you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see the alignment change, untie it on the third day, and then reset what has changed; and apply a poultice, made of mill dust with plenty of eggs or sesame flour, after you have removed the wax; and place light wool on the poultice, and if the poultice adheres, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until it is healed; often it is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess occurs, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and a wound together, check if any piece of bone is missing; if so, carefully remove it with suitable instruments.
And if the wound is narrow, enlarge it with a flame according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, sew the wound if it is large, and apply a suitable poultice to it, to generate flesh, until it is healed.
of the collarbone The collarbone often breaks in front, towards the shoulder, and the fracture occurs in three ways: either it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, which is the easiest to restore; or there is a fracture with a wound.
And the procedure is that when the fracture is without a wound, you need two assistants, one to hold the support for the broken collarbone; and the other to extend the neck towards the area; then align the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is no misalignment or shortening.
And if you need more extension, place a round ball of cloth or wool under the patient's shoulder, and make it thick according to your need; and extend and lift the collarbone, and tighten the ball with your hand, so that you set the fracture evenly, as is necessary.
And if you cannot pull the head of the collarbone outward, because it is deep, the patient must lie often on their back, and place a medium pillow under the shoulder, and the assistant pushes the shoulder down, so that the collarbone is raised.
Then align the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it broken into pieces, you must cut above; and gently extract the pieces, and if the bone cannot join due to any overlap, cut it with one of the incising tools you have; but place this instrument under the collarbone to protect the membrane:
and it looks like a spoon, and is not finished, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the extent of the work; and it has two ends, as you see, one wide, and the other narrow, as is the shape of the wound you made when you extracted the bones;
and when you are sure of preventing a hot abscess, sew the wound, and if the cut is small, or you fear a hot abscess, fill the wound with cloths and tents, according to its size.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, moisten a cloth with rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.
The binding of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is to apply a poultice of mill dust and plenty of eggs to the bone, place light tow on it, and place a ball under the armpit if necessary; then take a very large bandage one palm wide, then place a double cloth over the tow, and the poultice; then take a delicate splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around the bandage, so that the ends of the bandage hang down; and place the splint on the fracture, and turn the bandage over the neck, and under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit; and secure it from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture well, and you see clearly that the splint does not move on the broken bone, adjust it every day, and when the binding loosens, tighten it;
and have the patient lie on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when they sleep, to lift the support upwards; this will relieve the fracture of the collarbone by lifting the shoulder, or tie the arm to the neck, and do not untie it unless bad symptoms occur, for twenty days;
then restart the poultice if necessary, and tighten it and leave it so, until it is restored; and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in less for some people.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder breaks either broadly or in the middle, and it can only be known by touch; so align it according to the shape of the fracture, and return it to its natural form in every way you can; then put mill dust with plenty of eggs on the spot, and light tow, and place a double cloth on it; then place a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if there is a depression under the splint in any part of the shoulder, fill that depression with linen tow, so that the splint sits evenly; then firmly bind it all with a large bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage every day; and every time it loosens, tighten it, and set the splint correctly if it is out of place, and have the patient lie on their side; and the shoulder is restored in 20 or 25 days. And when this number is completed, untie it, and be sure, because it is not a bone that dislocates easily.
And if a piece of bone protrudes and points under the skin, cut above it, and remove it, and do what we have said for the fracture of the collarbone to soothe a hot abscess.
Of the fracture of the chest
The chest is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely; it often breaks on the outside. And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks down, and the patient feels great pain, shortness of breath, and coughs, and perhaps vomits blood, and the protrusion of the broken bone is visible, and it can be easily felt.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and places a cushion between the shoulders, then press the shoulders together, and align the ribs of both sides with your hands, and adjust them evenly in every way you can, so that the shape of the bone is as it should be; then apply poultices and tow over a thin splint of willow, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and tighten it properly, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it; and if it needs to be untied for corrosion or itching that occurs at the spot, or pain or abscess, untie it quickly, and change the poultice, and address the issues with appropriate treatments; then reapply the poultice, and tighten it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the ribs
Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick parts near the back, and at the ends inside, and they only bend because they are flexible; and it can be easily felt by probing with fingers.
And the restoration is that you set the fracture evenly, as necessary. Then apply the poultice, and bind it with a splint, if needed.
And if the rib fracture is inclined inward, the patient feels great pain and sharpness, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a large amount of blood, and this is very serious, and the ancients devised great ingenuity for it.
And there are some who say that it is necessary to administer foods that swell the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest hot abscesses occur, if they have not already occurred. And if it has occurred, treat it.
And some of them say to apply cups to the spot, to draw out forcefully, and this seems reasonable; however, there is a concern that the cups might draw impurities to the spot due to weakness.
And some of them say to cover the spot with wool soaked in hot oil, and place tents between the ribs to even the bandage around, then treat as pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot endure because the bone pierces the tissue, and there is a concern for the patient, then cut above the broken rib, and place an instrument underneath to protect the surface; and then the bone should be cut, and removed carefully, and then sew the two lips of the wound if it is large, and treat with poultices, until it is healed. And if a hot abscess occurs, place cloths soaked in rose oil on the spot, and treat the spot as necessary for abscess, and the patient should lie often on the side where he should, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the neck
Sometimes fractures occur to the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens that they bend; and also to the spine. And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if you see their hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it. Know that this is mortal in many cases, and if they can move and feel well when squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and the patient can be cured if treated.
And if similar things happen to the spine, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if the feet are softened, and if the same symptoms appear as in the hands, and if on the back there is wind and involuntary egestion; and when turned on their stomach, there is involuntary egestion. And when turned on their back and they try to sit up, they cannot. Know that this is mortal: do not work on their treatment.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the situation is lighter.
And the treatment is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then place rose oil or egg yolk oil on the spine until it is soothed; then apply one of the comforting and drying poultices, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and not to sleep on the side where they feel the pain, until they are healed. And if any bones are disjointed, then you need to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two lips of the wound if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed; and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the tail," then place your thumb of the left hand on it, and set it evenly with the other hand as much as you can, then apply the poultice and the splint if needed; then tighten it, and if there is a dislocated bone, cut above it, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is fractured, and if it happens, it is only a slight thinning at the head; and it fractures lengthwise, and bends inward, and the patient feels pain at the spot, and sharpness, and the fractured part swells.
And the restoration is that you place your hand on it, until you are on the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape; and if the fracture is at the head only, then set that fracture evenly, so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it bends inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared. And when you have set it evenly, then apply the poultice, then place a splint of wood or leather on it, and bind the fracture, so that it does not move; and fill the spot under the ribs, so that the bandage is even.
And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, do not touch it, until the hot abscess is soothed, and apply what we have mentioned before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as necessary, if there are no bad accidents; and this is the method.
Of the fracture of the clavicle
The clavicle is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it should be restored according to one of two methods: one is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, in this shape:
And tie two straps at the two ends, and hang it up, and seat the patient on a chair; then throw the fractured arm over the wood, so that it comes to the armpit, and has in the middle a curvature of wood, then hang some weight on it or the assistant pulls it down; then the physician sets the fracture evenly with his hands together, so that the fracture returns to how it should be.
And the other method is to lay the patient on his back, and tie his hand to his neck, then command two assistants, one holds what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below with a strap, and each one stretches in his part.
And if you see that the stretching needs to be stronger, then bind a strap below the fracture, and above the fracture, and each assistant stretches in his part. And if the fracture is near the shoulder, then you need to place a medium strap under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture; and if the fracture is towards the elbow, then lightly place a strap, without effort, until the fracture is even on the spot, and on the elbow; then set the fracture evenly, as necessary, and bind it, if no hot abscess occurs.
And if a hot abscess occurs, do not bind it for seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscess is soothed; then bind it, and the method of binding is to apply the poultice on the fracture, then place the arm on the clavicle, and place your hand on the shoulder or the breast; and place the cloth, and bind the clavicle, and the arm, so that the arm is in place of splints, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you fear that the bone will move, then use splints, and place on the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have between each splint a finger's width, and each splint should be so large that it extends three fingers beyond the fracture on each side; then bind the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on fractures, stronger and less as you move away.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the binding, as we said, when you restore the fractured limb, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave it bound for seven days, as we said; then check every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling does not occur at the spot, or nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight. Adjust it, as we said.
And if none of these accidents occur, then do not unbind it for three days or more, and the patient should sleep on his back, and have his hands on his stomach; and place under the clavicle a cushion filled with wool evenly, and check every hour of the day or night, that the shape of the fractured limb does not move, or the bandage does not soften; then adjust it with the power of medicine, and give the food we mentioned before, in such a way that the food is initially light; and when it starts to heal, then it should be substantial. And it is customary that the clavicle and the leg should be healed in forty days in total; and then it should be unbound and administer baths and ointments to adjust the spot. And if the structure is ugly and swollen, then it remains unbound for fifty days or two months.
Of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "fosciles," one of which is small, and it follows the thumb; and the other is large, and it is underneath, towards the little finger; by chance the large foscile alone fractures, or the small one, and by chance both together.
When the small foscile is fractured, the restoration is easy, and the healing; and when the large one is fractured, the healing is difficult, and more serious than when both are fractured together. If it is the small foscile that is fractured alone, then it needs to be lightly stretched, and set evenly.
And if it is the large foscile, then it needs to be bound more strongly; and extend it on a cushion, and hold the thumb higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be crossed on himself, and a cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient does not suffer any strain; then the assistant stretches his arm to the part below with his hand, or with a strap, and another assistant to the other part above. And then the physician sets it evenly, according to its best shape.
And if the fracture has pieces, then place each one in its place, and if any are dislocated that pierce the flesh, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut above it and remove it, as we said before.
And if the fracture is with a wound, I have spoken about it in the specific chapter; so take the treatment.
And if a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of the restoration, then glue a cloth with a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, that is neither too hard nor too soft; and bind a cloth above subtly, until the hot abscess is soothed. And then remove the plaster, and apply the poultice made of mill powder with egg yolk, then place the splints, and the splint of the fracture should always be stronger, and a little wider than the others; and know that it should have six splints on the arm in various positions: whether the fracture is in one bone, or in both; and bind more on the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and the cloths on the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and the thread, with which it is bound, should be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we said. And observe the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad accidents happen to the limb, like itching that comes to the limb, then you need to moisten the limb with warm water, until the itching is soothed; and let the limb rest, not tightly bound. And then start the binding again, and if the binding is loosened and the bone dislocated, and similar things, then adjust it.
And if you see that nourishment cannot come to the limb, because it is too tight, then you need to loosen it a little, and leave it so for a few days, until nourishment flows there, and then bind it again.
And if none of these things we mentioned happen to the patient, then do not unbind it for twenty days or around that time, then hang the hands to their neck, and the neck should be even, and avoid movement and dislocation, and sleep on their back; and know that this fracture is restored in thirty days or thirty-five, and sometimes in twenty days, depending on the composition and complexion of the strengths.
Of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the joints of the fingers, fractures rarely occur, and most often it is just a dislocation.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or dislocated, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit upright; then place their hand on a stretched cloth, and the assistant stretches the fractured bones, and the physician sets them evenly, until they are well joined; then apply the poultice and the padding, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and wrap it in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the underside around the palm, then make a pad of cloths, and instruct the patient to press it against the fractured palm; then bind it with a long cloth, and the splint should be soft wood as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as needed.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you should place a splint on top and another underneath the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it all around the hand, and secure the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture is at any of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, set it evenly, as needed; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to stabilize the fracture, and prevent movement; and if the fracture is on other fingers, like the index or another, set it evenly, and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or bind them all together as one, which is better, or place a splint, as on the thumb; and monitor the restoration and the development of a hot abscess, and treat what arises, as I have said.
Of the fractured thigh
The thigh bone is often fractured, and it is easily seen when it turns forward and backward; and the restoration is such that a bandage is tied above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on their back, then each assistant stretches their part evenly; and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is near the root of the thigh, then one of the bandages should be near the groin, and the other below the fracture. And similarly, if it is near the knee, then the bandage should be near the knee, and the extension below; then the physician sets the bone evenly with his two hands, until it is in its natural shape, and then applies the poultice, and binds it, if no hot abscess forms.
And if there is a hot abscess, then let it settle, then return to your work and care; the binding is done in this way. You should wrap over the fracture a hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the buttock, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, near the knee below, and the ends of the thread come above; then turn the bandage over the leg and the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the bone of the leg; then fill the space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloth to make the binding even, then start binding firmly three or four times over the fracture; and the further you go from the fracture, the less you bind; then address the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie three splints above, then go down to the end of the thread, until you reach the foot; and bind it, so that it does not move from its place, then leave it so, provided that no abscess or swelling or anything similar occurs.
And if it does occur, then unbind it, and adjust what occurs, as we have said many times; and if there are pieces of bone that pierce, they should be removed, if possible; and if it is not possible, then the area should be cut, and the pieces extracted; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is fractured so that splints are placed, as in the shoulder and arm; however, with the restoration done this way, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, depending on the diversity of complexions.
Of the fracture of the kneecap
Know that the kneecap rarely fractures, but it often dislocates. And if it fractures, it is usually just a crack or a small hole, and it happens both with and without a wound, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is such that what is round is set evenly with your fingers, until it is as closely joined as possible; then apply the poultice, and place a round splint, if needed, and bind it as necessary, then address all the conditions we mentioned in other fractures, such as hot abscesses and similar; and apply to each condition what is needed, until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg
Know that the leg has two bones, one is rightfully called "mustel," and the other is called "foscile"; and fractures occur just as they do in the arm, and for this reason, the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the work is all one.
And if both bones are fractured together, the leg will twist in all directions.
And if the thin bone is fractured, it twists forward.
And if the thick bone is fractured, there is great pain, and it is easily seen; and it twists downward. Then administer extension, and set it evenly, and bind the splints evenly; but if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, then the extension should be less and more gentle; and adjust it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two carved wooden pieces that embrace the leg on both sides, and are as long as the leg from the knee down; then wrap in two places a bandage above and below, and bind it in the middle as well, and this way the leg cannot incline to the right or left, and so it is good; and some use a long board for the leg, made of wood, and place the leg in it to prevent movement, and this is done especially when the fracture has a wound; and move the leg every day to see if there is a hot abscess or another issue; treat it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the foot bones
Fractures do not occur at the ankle, but sometimes there are fractures in the bones of the foot and rarely in the toes, and it usually results in a break in multiple places.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see the bones overlapping, have the patient place their foot on the ground, as if they were going to walk, then place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, and press until they return to their places; then apply the poultice and padding, and place under the arch of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then bind it to the foot properly, after wrapping cloth around it, and other necessary things.
And after three or four days have passed, unbind the bandage, because you will find the bones are even, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are fractured, restore them as we said for the fingers of the hand; then place a splint on the fractured toe according to the length of the toe, and it should be a little wider, then place under the foot the board I mentioned, and bind it properly; and if two or three or more toes are fractured, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrap in a linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and stand on the edge of the board outside the arch of the foot, so that it holds well.
And you must not forget the other things I said for other fractures, as we mentioned; and address each condition as needed.
Of the fracture of the wrist bone
When the bone of a woman's pelvis is fractured, have her sit with her legs spread, then lean her back and support her from behind; then fill her vaginal canal with cotton, and insert as much as the size of a fist; then stand her up, and gradually lift her back, and the cotton will push the bone back into place. When she needs to urinate, remove the cotton, and after urinating, replace it, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will be restored. If you prefer, take a sheepâ€™s bladder, attach a tube to the opening, and insert the entire bladder into the vagina; then blow into the tube forcefully until the bladder inflates inside: this will reposition the bone; then fill it with cotton, and leave it for a few days, until it is healed.
And when the wrist bone of a man or woman is fractured, restore it as we have said for the hip bone; and these fractures are not hidden from one who studies and practices this, and understands my book. For the fracture itself shows in many ways the proper method of restoration: therefore, understand it.
In the case of a fractured penis, take a goose neck and insert the penis into it; then wrap it with cloths, and leave it for three days or so, and it will heal quickly.
Of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone with a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that they be bled immediately, as we have previously described.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin to restore the fracture at the same time or that day, if no hot abscess forms.
And if a hot abscess forms, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, as you could cause a bad condition.
And if the fractured bone is visible under the exposed flesh, you must set it carefully with your hands, with slight extension.
And if the extension is not sufficient to set it with your hands, use this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and therefore the physician must have three or four of them, according to what is needed for each fracture treatment; and it should be round and a little thick, so it does not bend under pressure on the limb during your work, and it should be pointed at the front, and thick in the middle, like this:
And it is called "palainche," for the curved end should be placed on the head of the exposed bone; and press it once, until it returns, and is even with the other. And if the fracture is delicate, and the instrument cannot grip the bone well, you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument can grip it.
And if you cannot set the bone as we have said, cut it with a suitable instrument, either a chisel or saw, as needed; then smooth what remains in the bone of roughness and small fragments.
And when the bone is set, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place. So make sure it is in its place, then moisten a cloth in dark styptic wine, especially if it is summer; and do not put cerate or anything with oil on the wound, as it could cause decay and corruption; then apply splints when you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut the cover all around, according to the size of the wound, and be very careful that the wound is not compressed with the fracture; many foolish physicians have done this, and have caused death or gangrene in the patient at times; and the binding should be softer and gentler than in other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that bad conditions may develop, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, do not apply splints; instead wrap around it, instead of splints, with hard cloths, and bind them. And when you see after a day or two that the wound is generating pus, remove what you have applied with wine, and apply a healing ointment, such as tetrafarmacum ointment or similar.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, in the morning and evening, until it is fused and healed.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the pus can drain easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot fuse but continuously produces pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, which must be removed by probing the wound with a tent, and removing all these loose pieces that cause this pain.
And if a fistula develops in the area, or another type of corruption, you must treat it, as stated in the previous chapter. And when the bone is fractured and exposed on the limb, such as the thigh bone or shoulder bone, and other similar large bones, do not pull it out, as this can often cause death; instead leave it until it rots; it will fall off on its own after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can; if not, leave it.
Of the calluses that form on the joint
Often, after the healing of the fracture, especially when it is near the joint, a callus forms, and it is an ugly thing to see the shape of the limb; and it may not be able to perform its natural functions.
So, if the callus is fresh: apply styptic medicines to it, such as aloe, incense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, either one of these or all together, and mix them with styptic wine or with egg white or honey; and apply them to the callus with padding, and bind it well, and do not unbind it for several days; then unbind it, and apply another, until the callus is removed; or apply a well-made piece of lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings on the limbs; and if the callus has already turned hard like a stone, and it is necessary to remove it, cut it off on top, and slice off the apparent excess; or scrape it with a razor, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
When the fracture of the bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and thin, it happens for many reasons: one is that it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bindings, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of too much washing; or because of too much movement, not at the right time; or because there is little blood in the body, making it weak.
And the cure is to make the patient eat well, and make the body plump, so that the blood multiplies in them; and administer baths, and give them joy and happiness; then apply poultices to the limb, so that the poultice draws great nourishment to it, and frequently wash it with warm water, until the nourishment flows to the limb; and it returns to its natural shape.
Of the limb twisted after healing
When the limb is twisted after healing, and the fractured bone is visible, and the shape of the limb is ugly, although it does not lose its natural function: do not believe the fools who say the limb must be broken anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land; this method is criticized, and causes great harm, and sometimes death; however, if the callus and twisting are fresh, they should be washed with warm water, or cooked softening herbs, such as mallow leaves, roots, and melilot, and similar things; and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and apply the poultice; or take fat figs, and mash them with cow dung, and similar medicines that reduce the hardening.
And sometimes the callus is removed by continuously and long rubbing with moist hands. And administer movement to the limb every hour.
And if the twisting is old and hardened, like a stone, and needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut down to the bone, with a light subtle chisel; and put care and effort into the treatment.
Here begins the book of dislocations
A dislocation occurs when a joint is out of place, causing the limb to be misshapen and the patient to experience great pain and injury.
When a dislocation happens to someone, it must be reduced (put back in place) immediately without delay.
If one delays, the area will swell, and then it will be difficult to put back in place; for this reason, it should not be moved when swollen: it often causes spasms and other pains.
However, if this happens, make the patient bleed, then leave it until the hot swelling subsides; then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently put it back, and treat each limb as necessary.
And I have organized the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Of the mandibles (jawbones)
It is rare for both mandibles to be dislocated, and their dislocation occurs in two ways: either they are slightly out of place and somewhat loosened; or they are entirely dislocated, hanging towards the chest, and saliva runs from the mouth as it cannot be held, nor can the mouth be closed, and the tongue becomes entangled with speech.
When the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its place on its own.
And if it is complete and severe, you must reduce it quickly without delay.
In such a manner that the assistant holds the patientâ€™s head, and the practitioner places his thumb inside the mouth at the root of the dislocation if it is on both sides; and the other fingers are outside, to align; and command the patient to relax the mandibles and move them in all directions.
And the practitioner aligns it until it returns to its place.
And if it is difficult to reduce, especially if both mandibles are dislocated together, then bathe them with warm water and oil until they can be gently put back in place; do not delay in reducing, as we have said.
And when they are equally reduced, and the patientâ€™s mouth closes well without difficulty, apply cloths soaked in a mixture of rose oil and wax, then bind lightly with soft ties.
And let the patient sleep on his back, with his head supported between two cushions, so that it does not move to the right or left, and does not strain to chew, but takes light food until the pains are gone, and the mandibles are healed.
And then he may eat whatever he wants lightly, and does not strain to open the mouth for eating and drinking until the mandibles are well healed.
And if the two mandibles cannot be set right at once and are not returned to their places, fevers and sudden habitual conditions may arise, and possibly diarrhea, and possibly vomiting of pure bile.
And when you see this, then know that it is a sign of death; and often those who experience it die within eight days.
Of the collarbone
The collarbone cannot dislocate from the rib internally where it connects to the chest, but it sometimes dislocates externally, and it is easily felt.
The treatment is for the patient to lie often on his back and extend his arms; then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return; then apply a plaster and a bandage, and tighten it.
The end near the shoulder cannot dislocate; if it does sometimes dislocate, then return it to its place, as we have said; then apply the plaster and bandage, and tighten it, and command the patient to rest until it is healed.
And in the same way, the head of the shoulder is reduced when it is out of place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder can only dislocate in three ways: one is dislocation downwards towards the armpit; the second is towards the chest; and sometimes upwards, but this happens rarely.
And it does not dislocate backwards through the shoulder, nor internally through the nerves; it often dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in these it quickly dislocates; in those who have enough flesh, it dislocates with difficulty and returns with difficulty.
And sometimes, due to impact or fracture, the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and it is thought to be dislocated because of this.
Therefore, it is necessary to examine it to be sure; and then begin the treatment.
The dislocation is recognized when it is downwards towards the armpit, and by the difference between the sick shoulder and the healthy one, which will be manifest. And you will find a depression at the head of the shoulder, and below the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were an egg; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose or make any movements.
And also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you will find it manifestly by touch.
And this type of dislocation is not difficult to reduce when it is recent, or if the child is young.
The method is for the assistant to lift the patient's arm upwards, then place your thumbs under the armpit, and lift the joint forcefully upwards into place; and the assistant lifts the arm, and extends it upwards, then places it below; so it will come back quickly.
And if it does not come back as we have said after several days, then the patient must be bathed in warm water; and administer soothing and softening baths, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and let it be administered.
Then let the patient lie on his back, and place a woolen pad under the armpit, neither too soft nor too hard, then the practitioner places his heel on the pad, and virtuously lifts the head of the shoulder, and pulls the patient's hand.
And another assistant holds the patient's head so that it does not move downwards; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you want, reduce it according to this method.
And have present a man who is taller than the patient; and let him stand to the side, and place his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air. And another assistant pulls the patient's hand down towards the abdomen. And if the patient is too light, let something heavy be hung with him, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And reduce it also in another manner: which is to drive a long stick into the ground, with the head as round as a pestle, and not too thick nor too thin. Then place it under the patient, but let it have soft cloths on it, and the patient stands along the stick; then extend his hand down strongly from the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly.
And if it does not return despite all these methods we have mentioned, then do this treatment: take a stick two arms long and four fingers wide, with a round head to fit deeply under the armpit, in this shape:
Then wrap soft cloths around the head of the stick, so it does not hurt the patient, then place it under the patientâ€™s armpit; and extend his arm along the stick, and tie the joint onto the stick, and the arm at the hand's head, then place the arm on a rung of a wide ladder, and extend the hand down, and let the body hang from the other side: the joint will return immediately.
And when it is in place, by whatever method, it is necessary to place an equal wool pad under the armpit, then apply a plaster made of mill dust, incense, and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around, then bandage appropriately under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and brace the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain like this.
And it is necessary for him to eat little, so that the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster; and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come, or for another reason, it is necessary to apply cauterization at three points, as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
And if you do all this, and it dislocates again after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and he cannot lift his arm up, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut, stretched, or softened; and know that the joint will never be firmly set in place.
The dislocation towards the chest, and the nipples, or behind, is caused by an impact, and extending the hands, and it is treated in another way; and treated until it is healed.
And if after healing stiffness comes to the limb, and delay in movement, let the patient use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and it returns to its original nature.
Of the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the elbow joint is rarely dislocated, and rarely returns; and it is dislocated in all directions, especially front and back, and the dislocation is not hidden, for it is easily seen and felt; and dislocates in different ways. And when you compare the sick elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is displaced, and he cannot bend his arm or touch his shoulder with it.
And it is necessary to reduce it before a hot abscess appears, for if a hot abscess comes, it will be difficult to reduce; and possibly it cannot be completely reduced, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and is more painful, and possibly leads to death.
And the treatment is, when it can be reduced, to extend the patient's hand with both your hands; and his arms spread out, and the practitioner's hands around the elbow, above and below, and push the joint with your thumbs together, or at the base of the palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the base of the palm the elbow that is dislocated.
And if it does not return to its place, then apply strong extension; and this is when two assistants extend the arm, and two assistants hold it, so that it does not move during the extension; then twist the arm in all directions, after wrapping it in a long and wide doubled cloth.
And when the practitioner has aligned the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly until it returns.
And when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then untie it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it; and if you see that the joint is not tight, reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it for a few days, until it is firmly set; then untie it.
And if he feels stiffness after the joint is reduced, and it moves, then bathe it and rub it gently, and press until it is relieved; or apply a greasy lamb's wool to the joint, leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and let him bathe in a bath. And when he sweats, rub the joint gently, then reapply the wool, and then enter the bath; and do this two or three times until it is healed; and if you want, apply warm cow dung mixed with butter, and bind it on; it will return to its proper condition.
The dislocation of the hand
The joints of the hand dislocate, and their reduction is easier, more than other joints. However, it must be reduced quickly, at the same time it is dislocated, before the area swells or a hot abscess forms.
And the reduction is done by placing the injured hand on a table, and the assistant extends the hand, and the practitioner aligns it, placing his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, it is necessary to check if it is well placed; then have the patient place the back of his hand on the table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, let the patient place the back of his hand on the table, and the practitioner places his hand on the prominence of the joint. If it returns immediately, that is good.
If not, bind it with plasters soothing hot abscesses, and leave it without reapplying.
And if he cannot endure it, and you cannot put it back in place after a few days, the joint remains twisted.
And it does not harm the patient except that the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything: then know that the nerves are cut, or the arteries; and there is no other remedy except cauterization near the area, and possibly nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then untie it and leave it like that.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is some stiffness, bathe it in warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated in all directions, sometimes on the back of the palm or the front.
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns, then support the tip of the finger, and hang it towards the side where it is dislocated.
And leave it for two days, then set it properly that day; and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and rebind it at night; and do this often until it is stable.
And do the same if it is dislocated to the front of the hand, and do as you did before until it is healed; and do the same when it is dislocated elsewhere.
Of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly follows the patient.
And the signs are that the excretions escape without control, and cannot be held, and often some limbs are paralyzed, either both thighs or both arms or one.
And often the spine moves in four directions; the one that moves backwards is called "kyphosis."
The treatment is to see if the kyphosis came from childhood: then there is no cure or complete healing.
And the one that comes from falling or impacts or similar causes, the ancients gave methods of treatment with long explanations, but not all are greatly effective.
But I have shortened it according to my understanding, and have created instruments in various ways.
I say that in the kyphosis that comes to the chest in front, there is no remedy or healing.
And also the one that comes directly on both sides, and can only be treated if it is specifically on the back, as I say.
And it is that the patient is stretched on his stomach on an even surface, with padding underneath so he is not hurt.
Then drive a stick firmly into the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a band under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles.
And two assistants pull the bands, one at the head and the other at the feet, through the two sticks.
And let the sticks be well secured as we have said, and the practitioner places his palms on the spine firmly until it returns.
And if it does not return by this method, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and the patient lies on his side, and place the end of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine. And the practitioner places his feet on the other end of the board, and presses well until it returns to its place; and if you want, do it with a hand-operated winch.
And this is to drive two sticks at the head of the patient, one arm's length apart, and two others towards the feet, and between each stick, above and below, a palm's width apart.
And each stick has a hole, where the winch turns, and let the sticks be firmly in the ground so they do not move; and between each two sticks have a rotating stick, where the bands turn, and have on each rotating stick two small sticks a palm's length, to turn the winch.
And then tie the band around the armpits to the winch at the head, and the other band to the winch at the feet, and each assistant turns his winch with the band, and the practitioner sets the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, apply a drying plaster with egg white, then padding, then a splint of a small board three fingers long, covering the kyphosis area and the healthy part of the spine, then tie it with a band as we have said, and let the patient use subtle nourishment until it is healed.
And if something arises at the end of healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint we have mentioned before; and sometimes a piece of lead is applied.
And sometimes the appearance of a protrusion in the back vertebra of the spine occurs, and it is thought to be a dislocation; but it is the bone that is protruding, therefore one should not presume: it could possibly lead to death.
Of the dislocations of the hip
Know that the joints of the hip and the shoulder only suffer dislocations, not other injuries like other joints; and the hip joint dislocates in four directions: inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards; more inwards than elsewhere, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And the recognition of its dislocation inwards is that when the injured leg is compared with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee appears more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend his knee properly. And the area near it is swollen with a hot abscess because the head of the thigh bone comes there.
And the signs of the one whose dislocation is outwards are that these symptoms are opposite to those before.
And the signs of the one whose dislocation is forwards are that he extends his leg well completely; however, he cannot bend his knee without pain, and if he tries to walk, he cannot move forward, and retains his urine, and the groin swells, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the signs of the one whose dislocation is backwards are that he cannot extend his knee or bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh bone is located below the ribs.
The reduction of this type of dislocation is to check if the dislocation is old, and if it remains as it is, there is no cure; and it is not necessary to assume otherwise.
And in the one whose dislocation is recent, and it is of the four types of dislocation, quickly turn the joint, and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left; possibly it will return, and no other treatment is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with both hands, or with a band tied above the knee. And another assistant extends his hand above in such a manner that he places his hands under the armpits, then ties a soft band above the thigh; and another holds the end of the band.
And they extend upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is lifted off the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This method of extension is common to all four types, and if the dislocation returns, as we have said, it is good.
If not, it is necessary to treat it according to its type. When the dislocation is inwards, lay the patient on his healthy side, then place the band at the base of the thigh, and the area below the groin, then extend the band upwards towards the groin and the hip bone.
Then another assistant takes his arms, and embraces the thick part of the injured thigh, and extends it outwards strongly: it will return to its place immediately; and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot set it in this way as we have said, it is necessary to tie the patientâ€™s two feet together with a strong soft band around the two heels and around the two knees, and let the injured leg be extended two fingers more than the other.
Then hang from the head of a stick, and be two arms' length above the ground; then command one assistant to embrace the head of the thigh, and another assistant hanging with the patient, who strongly embraces the thigh, for the joint will return immediately and quickly.
And when the dislocation is outwards, let the patient lie as we have said for one with kyphosis, and tie a band around the injured leg properly, and around the foot as well.
Then place two sticks, one at the head and another at the feet, then drive a stick between the patient's thighs in the middle. And wrap it with moist cloths around, so it does not hurt the patient, then each assistant extends towards him, and the practitioner sets the dislocation with his hand.
If it returns, it is good. If not, place it on a table, and press it as we have said for kyphosis, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is forwards, it is necessary to extend the injured leg quickly, and according to what I have said; and the practitioner places his effort on the injured groin, then presses with the other hand, and extends it down towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is outwards, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards, nor to lift him off the ground, rather it is necessary that he be as if the hip were dislocated outwards, as we have said about lying on both hips. And be on his stomach, and the bands extended as we have said before, and press on the joint at the table.
And it will be right when the patient extends his legs, and they will be equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind with a band, so that the hip does not move.
And rest for three or four days, then untie, and apply the plaster; and if you see that they are equal, then bind it as before, and leave it for three days; then untie, and let him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Of the dislocation of the knee
The knee dislocates in three ways: namely, inwards, outwards, and backwards; and it does not dislocate forwards.
And the sign is that you command the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not attach to his thigh, know that it is dislocated.
And the treatment for all is to have the patient sit up straight, and extend his leg if he can, and place your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet.
Then take his knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then press the two sides of the knee firmly; and another assistant extends his foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he can bend his leg to his thigh easily.
And apply the plaster, and bind the leg to the thigh, and tie them together tightly for three or four days, then untie it; and do not let the patient walk until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not right, apply strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
on the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inward and outward.
The sign is that the ankle is swollen and sticks out in the part where it is dislocated:
The repositioning is easy, and it should be gently stretched by hand when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you should make the patient sit upright, and a strong assistant should hold the leg above the ankle;
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with the left hand twice, then stretch it upwards, and gently push the foot upwards;
And do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot; if it returns, that's good; if not, then repeat the process, as it will return;
And if it cannot return this way, then lay the patient on their back on the ground, and fix a post firmly in the ground between their thighs, and wrap it with cloths so it does not hurt the patient;
Then the assistant holds the thigh, and another assistant extends the foot by hand or with a strap tied around the ankle; Then each assistant stretches equally, and the post remains between the patient's thighs to hold the patient when stretching;
Then the practitioner sets the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is set, apply a plaster and cotton on it, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and ensure that the nerves behind the ankle are not too constricted;
Then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage loosens, tighten it; then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; And if he walks before that time, there is no certainty that it will not dislocate again.
And if a hot abscess occurs, it is necessary to soothe it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is healed.
Of the fingers
When the toes are dislocated, they should be gently extended without effort, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you should make the patient sit on a flat surface or a straight table, and place your foot on what is visible of these joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns;
And when it is set and nothing is visible, place a two-headed board under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, and leave it for three days, then untie it; and let it rest until it is healed.
Of wounds and dislocations together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and it is to be restored, many times the patient dies:
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment if you are not wise in the art and have not practiced it long, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and cautious, not bold;
And use at the beginning things that soothe hot abscesses, and leave the patient in the hands of God if you see no hope of healing; And when you see hope, set the limb back in place immediately, before the hot abscess occurs;
And when the limb is in place, administer things that soothe hot abscesses, and treat the wound as necessary with drying ointments;
And if there is a fracture with the dislocation, and small loose bones, remove them, and do as we have said for simple injuries;
And avoid acting out of fear, as I have said, for it will help you according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and body. Amen
