The clitoris may grow in size above the order of nature so that it gets a horrible deformed appearance; in some women it becomes erect like the male organ and attains to coitus.	Swelling sometimes enlarges beyond the natural state, becoming disfigured and unsightly; in some women, it may grow to the extent that it expands like a male organ and becomes capable of sexual intercourse.	0.77444
You must grasp the growth with your hand or a hook and cut it off. Do not cut too deeply, especially at the root of the growth, lest haemorrhage occur.	Therefore, you should hold the excessive swelling with your hand or with a hook and cut it away; however, do not go too deep with the incision, especially at the base, to avoid bleeding.	0.8165401

As to the fleshy growth, that is, flesh growing in the cervix and filling it, and also often protruding like a tail (on which account some of the Ancients called it 'caudate disease'); this too you should cut away as you do for the clitoris, and dress until healed.	Overgrown flesh may grow within the opening of the uterus until it fills the space; it may even protrude outward in a tail-like manner. Because of this, some early scholars called this ailment "caudate illness." Thus, we should excise it as we do for swelling, and treat it until it is healed.	0.7254128
