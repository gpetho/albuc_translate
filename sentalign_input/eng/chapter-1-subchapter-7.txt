 CHAPTER SEVEN.
On the cauterization of a chronic apoplexy.
 When an apoplexy has lasted a long while and has been treated by those methods we have given and your treatment has been ineffective but the patient has no fever, then burn him with four cauterizations: one on each frontal prominence; one in the middle of his head as we have described; and one at the back of the head as has been said.
The shape of the cauteries to be as before.
He may also be given one burn over the cardia of the stomach; that will be more efficacious.
Then treat as described.
