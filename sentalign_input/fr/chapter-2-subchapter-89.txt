Regarding the abscess of the nail
Panaris is an abscess that arises under the nail of the finger,
or the foot, or sometimes arises on other fingers;
and when it becomes old, and is not noticed, a hot abscess develops,
and runs and discharges pus until it affects the root of the nail, and sometimes affects the whole nail;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, causing foul-smelling pain, and the tip of the finger becomes large, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help,
it is necessary to cut with iron all the excess that remains of the nail,
then cauterize the wound afterward.
The cauterization is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is healthy;
and if the nail presses the flesh inside, and begins to prick, and injures it,
it is necessary to put a splint under the nail that pricks the flesh,
and push it up, and cut that flesh subtly and lightly,
and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove everything;
then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion is in the bone, cut it, and pull it out, because as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger corrupting, cut it at one of the joints as previously mentioned,
then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is bruised, and swollen, and it feels great pain, it is necessary to bleed it first;
then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, cutting across the top,
and ensure that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, because the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, apply something that soothes.
The pain of the additional finger of the hand
The additional finger that grows on the hands of some people is sometimes all flesh,
and sometimes it has bones, and sometimes it has a nail,
and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or the birth is in some joints of the fingers.
Those that grow on a joint of the finger do not move,
and those that grow at the joint of the finger, sometimes move;
the cutting of the one that is all flesh is easy, in this manner:
cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
Those that grow at the root of the joint are difficult to treat: avoid cutting.
For those that grow at the last joint, it is necessary to first cut the flesh roundly to the bone,
then cut the bone with a suitable saw, then treat it until it is healed.
The fusion that comes to the fingers together comes by birth, or by fusion of the wound, or by burn, or by similar things.
It is necessary to cut that fusion, so that the fingers return to their natural shapes;
then put between them tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not fuse;
or place between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as necessary.
If the fusion comes to any of these fingers with the palm, cut that fusion as necessary.
