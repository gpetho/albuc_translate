When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity or from thick vapour, so there is a severe disturbance of its natural constitution, and the patient has been treated as prescribed in the appropriate section but with no effect, the patient should lie back, and you should mark with ink the places of three cauterizations, in this form and exactly of this size below the costal cartilages, where the elbow reaches. Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body. Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.	When pain occurs in the liver due to cold and moisture, or from thick winds, disrupting its natural balance by excess, and treatment as prescribed does not help, then the patient should lie on his back, and mark with ink three cauteries in this shape and this same size below the hypochondria, at the point where the elbow meets: allow space between each cautery the width of a finger, and let the cautery be straight in the length of the body; do not press your hand too hard with the cautery.	0.8464153

You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art.	Indeed, it is possible to perform these cauterizations with a knife-like cautery, provided you possess skill and precision in the art.	0.7359542
Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.	Be cautious not to go too deeply with the cauterization, so as not to burn the full thickness of the skin, for this would burn the entire body and reach the intestines, as the skin there is thin; know this well.	0.85845244
