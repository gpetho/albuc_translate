The fifth chapter on cauterizing earaches.
If there occurs in the ear pain from cold.
And it is treated with laxatives and all the other treatments that we mentioned in the division, and the pain does not go away.
Then heat the cautery iron that is called "the point," which is of this form:
Then you apply drops with it, after heating it, around the entire ear as you go around, or around both of them if the pain is in both.
And you keep the cautery a little away from the base of the ear, after you mark the place with ink.
And the cautery should be the size of ten dots in each ear, or about that.
Then you treat the places until they heal, God willing.
