We have mentioned the types of fluids in the classification and which ones are suitable for cupping with detailed and explanatory words. Take them from there correctly. Then you should sit the patient before you, cross-legged, facing the light, near the sun.	We have already mentioned in the appropriate section the varieties of cataract and those in which depression is useful, in full detail; so you may take it accurately from there. You should cause the patient to sit down cross-legged before you, facing the light in full sun, and firmly bind up his sound eye.	0.80152345
And you bandage his healthy eye and tighten it well, then lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye containing the fluid is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.	Then lift up his eyelid with your left hand, if it be the left eye in which the humour is; or with the right hand if it be the right eye.	0.7513757
Then you place the tip of the lancet near the iris, about the thickness of a probe, in the white of the eye itself, towards the smaller canthus, then push the lancet forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the lancet that it has reached an empty space.	Then put the tip of the needle near the corona, about the thickness of a probe away, onto the white of the eye itself, on the side of the lesser canthus. Then thrust the needle firmly in, at the same time rotating it with your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye, and you feel that the needle has reached something empty.	0.908041
And the depth of the lancet's penetration should be equal to the distance between the pupil and the edge of the black, which is the iris of the eye, because you will see the lancet in the eye of the observer due to the clarity of the cornea. Then turn the lancet upwards to the place where the fluid is.	The depth the needle goes in should measure as the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris, which is the corona of the eye; you will see the metal in the pupil itself because of the transparency of the corneal tunic.	0.7119677
Then press it downwards repeatedly. If the fluid descends immediately, the patient will see whatever he opens his eyes to immediately, while the lancet is still in his eye. Then wait a little. If the fluid rises, lower it again without removing the lancet.	Then put the needle up to the place containing the humour; then press the point downwards time after time. If the humour comes down at once, the patient will at once see whatever his vision is opened upon while the needle is still in his eye. Then let him rest a little while; and if the humour goes back up again depress it a second time without taking the needle out.	0.8580705
When it has settled and does not rise, remove the lancet gently while slowly rotating it with your hand. Then dissolve some pure Indian salt in water and wash the inside of the eye with it. Then place a compress or moistened wool over the entire outside of the eye.	When it stays down firmly and does not come back again, gently draw the needle out, twisting it ever so slowly with your hand. Then dissolve a little pure rock-salt in water and wash the eyeball with the solution; then apply all over the outer aspect of the eye carded linen or wool moistened with oil of roses and egg-white, and bandage it up together with the sound eye.	0.826282
With rose oil and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye as well. But we and the people of our time apply crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the lancet does not enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have very hard eyes. Then you should take the scalpel called "al-bared," which looks like this:.	Now we and our contemporaries apply pounded cumin with the egg-white. But if the couching needle does not serve, failing to enter the eye on account of its hardness (for there are some whose eyes are hard indeed), you should take the scalpel called al-baridl figured thus.	0.7744851
Pierce the conjunctiva only with it, and do not penetrate deeply.  The purpose is just to prepare a small place for the lancet. Then insert the lancet as we have described. When your work is complete, prepare a comfortable bed for the patient to lie on his back in a darkened room.	With this make a perforation in the conjunctiva only, not piercing any further; for that is only to make a little entrance for the needle. And then thrust in the needle as we said before. At the end of your operation, prepare a solidly-built bed on which the patient may lie on his back, in a dark room; and keep him from all movement or coughing.	0.8255211
He should refrain from all movement and coughing. His food should be what softens his nature. He should not move his head right or left at all. The bandage should remain in place until the third day, then you loosen it in that darkened room and test his vision.	And prescribe such a diet for him as will relax his system; neither let him move his head to right or to left. Let the bandage remain in the same position till the third day.	0.66177005
Show him some things, then replace the bandage until the seventh day. You should not do this during the treatment or immediately after the incision. Rather, you should avoid this beforehand, because water rises quickly with intense looking.	Then loosen it in the same dark room and make trial of his sight, putting before him objects to be seen; then replace the bandage till the seventh day. You should not do this at the time of treatment nor immediately after the perforation by the needle; but on the contrary you should avoid it, for intensive use of the eye causes a rapid ascent of the humour.	0.75517106
If a hot swelling appears, you should uncover the eye before the seventh day and treat it with what will reduce the swelling. When it subsides, you can then release his sight and put a veil over his face, training his vision under it for a few days while he is in the darkened room. Then...	But if an abscess occur you should unbandage the eye before the seventh day and restore it to health by those methods that allay swelling. When it has subsided, allow him free sight, putting over his face a dark veil beneath which his vision may be exercised for a few days while he is still in the dark room. Then let him come out of the room gradually and take up the exercise of his business.	0.8435162
He may gradually leave the house and manage his affairs.  Know that the learner cannot dispense with observing the incision many times before proceeding with the operation. I have heard from some Iraqis that they mentioned making a hollow lancet in Iraq that sucks out the water.	Then let him come out of the room gradually and take up the exercise of his business. But you should know that in the case of a depression of a cataract the student cannot manage without having seen that operation performed several times; then he may perform it himself. I have heard that a certain Iraqi has said that in Iraq he makes a hollow needle by which the humour is sucked out.	0.76365125
I have not seen anyone in our country make it, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients. It may be a recent innovation. This is a picture of the types of lancets, so those who are unfamiliar with them may understand them:.	In our land I have never seen anyone do it in this fashion, nor have I read of it described in any of the books of the Ancients; perhaps it is newly invented. Here are the figures of some kinds of needle for the information of those who do not know them.	0.84587437
They are made specifically of brass, and their tips are of this thinness exactly, triangular and sharp.	They are mostly made of brass; and their extremities should be of this very fineness, triangular at the tip and sharp.	0.81220686
