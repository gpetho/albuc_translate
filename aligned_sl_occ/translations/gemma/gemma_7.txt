O, children, I have now completed this book for you, which is the latest of the science of medicine, to your delight, because of your faith in me, because of your exposure to me, and because of your declarations of me, behold that I must explain to you this treatise which is a part of my art, that is to say, surgery.
For surgery is highly dangerous in our land and in our time, so that the science of it is almost lost; and its vision is almost gone; and it remains only with a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which change the most and cause those errors and hesitation which arise from the understanding of it and from the shortness of its force and art
And it is seen by me that I have composed this treatise in such a way as to follow the path of exposure and declaration and abbreviation; and that I have added to the forms of the instruments of cautery and other instruments of the work as much as possible, in order to facilitate the declaration and to prepare the work, which is necessary
But the greatest cause why no wise man can be found in our time who is able to perform this art is that the art of medicine is long, and that it requires a great actor who has been exercised in the science of anatomy, who knows the structure of the members and the form of those, and the junction and separation of them; and who has the knowledge of bones, nerves and veins, and the number of them, and their color; and of the pulse of the veins and the quietness of the body.
And thus says Hippocrates that I have no name, more in the little work, and most of all in the art of the hand
And indeed we have already said in the beginning of this book that whoever is not learned in anatomy will fall into an error which will cause the death of men, as I have seen many of them who have been formed in this science and have departed from it because of this science and their experiments
For I have seen a foolish doctor who, being skilled, has incised an abscess of scrofula in the groin of a woman, and has incsed several arteries of the groin so that there flows a great abundance of blood, and the woman died between her thighs as a result
And I have seen another doctor who, being proud, took hold of a stone from a man who was suffering from it in his belly, and the stone was great, and he brought it to me and I cut that stone out with a piece of the intestine, and the man died on the third day.
And I have already mentioned this, and I see that for the greatness of the stone and for the condition of the patient I knew beforehand that he would die
And I have seen another doctor who took charge of the surgery of a duke from our land, and because of his stupidity he fractured the pelvis of a black slave who belonged to him; and neglecting to prepare the patient, he cut the fracture without letting out the wound, with sponges and towels of great tension, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And thus I have seen him depart according to his desires, and I have seen him relax, and I have seen him lie down for several days and command that we remove the bandage; and thus he died when the cavity and the foot were exposed after the abscess had burst, and he perished
And I went to see him, and I found him to be calm and quiet, and he allowed me to remove the bandage, and peace returned and he was relieved of his pains.
But indeed corruption had already spread in the limb, for that I was unable to check it, and I was forced to continue the corruption in the limb until the patient was in danger of death
And I have seen another doctor who pierced an abscess of cancer, and it ulcerated almost immediately, until the malice of the disease had increased so much in the master of the house that it became unbearable for him.
The cause of this is that cancer is pure melancholy humor, for it does not suffice for it to reach its full extent, but that it should remain in the limb which is suffering so that it should be the host of all things
And thus, children, it is necessary for you that the art of the hand be divided into two parts: that which is associated with health, and that which is dangerous in the greatest precautions
And I have already spoken of this in all places of this book concerning the operation in which there is error and fear; for it is necessary for you to guard against this and to leave that which may cause fear among the fools, so that they do not find fault with you or despise you
Therefore take up the sacred arms in the request and in the protection of God, and the wicked diseases in their flattery and their gentleness.
E usatz de la milhor via per la gracia de Dieu perdusent a salut e a lausabla successio, e laysatz las malautias terriblas de difficil sanacio, e ostatz las vostras armas de aquo que vos fa temer, per so que ysitatio en vostra fe e in le vostre nom no vos evasisca: quar mays es remanent a la vostra gloria, e pus aut en le mon e in derier a las evermore sanctitatz.
Indeed, I have already mentioned several times: “No medicine can cure a bad disease, so that no doctors will be called by name”.
And I have already read this book according to three chapters.
Let us begin the division of the book, and first of all from the first part The first chapter is arranged concerning the parts of the body, the forms of instruments and cautery utensils, and what is necessary for the operation
The second part is divided The second chapter deals with swelling and perforation, windblows, ulcers, and the extraction of arrows, all categorized and arranged according to the forms of the instruments
The third chapter deals with restoration and dislocation, healing of twists and similar cases; the chapter is arranged concerning the parts of the body, and the forms of the instruments
As for what I have said about the quality of the instruments of that cautery and the documents of them, and in what combination it is prohibited to perform cautery
Therefore I say that the discourse concerning the quality of the instruments of the cautery and the documents of them is a long and elaborate one, subtle for science, and a secret that is hidden; and that many great scholars have spoken about it, and they have disagreed with each other, and I believe that I have already said enough on this subject, fearing a lengthening of the discourse.
Therefore I say that the performance of cautery is permitted in all cases, except for two cases, which are the cautery of living beings and the cautery of inanimate matter.
In the cold and dry case, concerning inanimate matter, there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is useful in that case, while others say that it is harmful. For indeed, the nature of fire is quality and dryness, and it is inconvenient that in a cold and dry ailment the application of fire and dryness should be made.
And I say that those who say the opposite are mistaken, for in all cold and dry ailments that appear in the bodies of men, since you compare the body of man with the humidity of the air to the nature of fire, you find the body of man cold.
And I say concerning this discourse that I have already experienced several times in practice
I do not wish to speak of what has already been expounded and exercised in the chapter of cautery after practice, and to know the diversity of the composition of men and the arrangement of diseases in their bodies, and the causes of these, and their accidents, and the passage of time concerning these things
In other cases, however, it is not about you to fear, and especially in cold and wet ailments, for indeed all doctors agree on this, and they do not disagree concerning the usefulness of cautery in those cases
And know this, my son, that the secret of curing with fire and the goodness of it lies in the fact that fire is simple, and its action does not reach beyond the member that is cauterized, and does not affect the other member adjacent to it except for a slight document.
Indeed, the action of external medicine reaches only to that member in which it is applied, and does not cause any great harm in the healthy member next to it.
For fire, by its very nature and its substance, does not cause anything other than what is necessary. And we already know from experience and from long experience of study that fire is useful for the truth of the causes; and for this reason I am excused for the length of this discourse, for it is not customary for me to speak of such secret things to you.
Indeed, master, it is wise to delay the cautery and pause at the best time of the year.
I say that cautery is convenient at all times, for thus it is submerged in the joy of that which makes the cautery unbearable, especially if the cautery is for pains or necessary pains, which do not suffer from delay for fear that something malicious should come of it, which is greater than a slight neglect of the time.</end_of_turn>
I do not consent in such matters, or, master, those who do not esteem except the vulgar people and mad doctors, for it is not ridiculous at all times. Indeed, concerning that disease which is cured by cautery, it is not ridiculous at all times, and to pause is not at all necessary.</end_of_turn>
And the cause is not thus that they say, for cautery is nothing other than a means of medicine which alters the composition and dries out the humors which are the cause of these pains.</end_of_turn
Therefore, however, excessive cautery over medicine is desired for the worth and virtue of its operation and the greatness of the Lord's mercy.</end_of_turn>
And it is possible that your disease will return at any hour of the time, according to the composition of the disease and the location of the disease, and the virtue of them, and what is prepared in the body of them from the accumulation of superfluities in them, and what is obtained by them in their acquisition through food and the like of those causes; but if the disease in which cautery is administered is a subtle disease in a limb of few superfluities and humors, as for example cautery for toothache and the like, it is possible that in them the said pain will not return, even though it is done little.</end_of_turn>
And it may be said vulgarly that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a crafty word, not to which I agree, for I believe that it is not a cure that profits from medicine or from any other cause except cautery itself.</end_of_turn
On the contrary, the cause is that; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is true only when the methods of healing are administered in certain diseases, and those medicines do not suffice, and when the cause is finally overcome, cautery is administered, and it profits from that.</end_of_turn And indeed, from here it is sixteen years since I have said that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding which the vulgar people and the fools of doctors have.
I say that gold is better than silver, and I do not say this except for the equality of the gold and the inferiority of its substance.</end_of_turn
I say that the location of cautery does not make it bad, as it is not absolutely true, for I have already seen that it does no harm in any other way, and that cautery is good in that; but indeed when you make cautery with fire of gold, it is not your business, for it is ignited according to the quantity you wish for the brilliance of the gold, and you must prepare to receive cold; and if you do not adjust for it, the gold will be consumed by the fire, and if you do adjust for it too much, some plates will be shattered because the artist will be forced to cut too close to the edge.</end_of_turn
Therefore, for this reason it is better to make cautery with silver than with gold, and we must put it more lightly and more cautiously to the right of the operation.</end_of_turn>
I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those which are between the feet to be read, so that I may satisfy the request of those who ask for them.</end_of_turn
Chapter one.</end_of_turn>
This cauterization confers on cold and humidity the accidental cause of which is the cause of soda and multiple flux traumatic, called corissa, from the head to the limbs and the joints fluent, and multiple sleep, and toothache and gut pain, and universally of all diseases that come from cold, even such as paralysis, suffocation and apoplexy, and it is similar in these diseases.</end_of_turn
The form of this cauterization is as follows: first of all we command the patient to be evacuated with laxatives for three or four nights, according to whether you expect the virtue of the disease and its age and its custom.</end_of_turn
And then we command him to shave his head with a razor, and then we do that which is between your thighs over a fallen bench and that you place your hands over your feet.</end_of_turn
And hold your thumb close to the root of your nose between your eyebrows. Moreover, when the physician suspects that the limb is affected, he should mark that area with a cautery, which has this shape:
And hold it above the affected area, without stretching it too much, until the hand is slightly constricted, and then release it gently.
Then lift your hand slightly and support the limb, and if you see any quantity of bone exposed, even as much as the quantity of barley grains, elevate your hand until you see the bone again.
And take a little salt and dissolve it on the limb and leave it on for three days.
And hold over the wound edge in butter and leave it on until the scar of the fire is destroyed And give the limb rest with the tetrafarmacon until it is healed
And indeed when the wound remains open, one should take off the sleeve, for it is better and more beneficial.</start_of_turn>
I say that if the bone is cauterized near the bone, and if the cautery is kept on until every part of the substance of the bone is solidified, then the pain will be cured forever.</start_of_turn>
And let the area around the bone be smooth and let it be healed.</start_of_turn
I say that if the cautery is applied behind the bone, before it penetrates the bone, it will cause the bone to swell and become painful, and this is the way of making an incision in a small way.</start_of_turn And they say that from that area vapor escapes from the head.</start_of_turn
And let the wound remain open for a long time, and let it be healed when solidified.</start_of_turn
I do not know these two kinds of cautery, except in the hands of fools; and leave it to them, for I believe that it is better to be healthy than to be lame, as we have seen in other members, and especially when the patient has a cold temperament.
The first kind of cautery is better and more beneficial, for it is safer and more healing; and from that one and from this work I wish health to you.</start_of_turn>
Chapter two.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the head.</start_of_turn
When in the head there occurs chronic and long-lasting pain and the disease has been prolonged, and if there are burns, blisters, carbuncles, plasters, wool, sponges, lead, mercury, or silkworms, and especially if the head is already cauterized with one cautery which does not benefit it from these causes, then consider that if the head of the disease has a strong tendency to grow, it is not frail and you find no great heat, then you should cauterize with another cautery leaving a little space between them.</start_of_turn And cauterize the area around the heel of the foot with the cautery until the bone is fractured.</start_of_turn Cut the bone and uncover from the bone the quantity that we have recounted, and cauterize that part at the back of the head in the area where the veins are compressed — that is the place where the wind is stopped.</start_of_turn And hold your hand over it, and do not uncover the bone, for the disease from this cause experiences great pain different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.</start_of_turn
I say that this cautery is in this place, because the cautery of the head with which the horns and the occipital bone are cauterized is more subtle than that which is cauterized in the middle of the head; and this is the way to do it.</start_of_turn
Chapter three.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of ancient emigration.</start_of_turn
When there is severe pain in the part of the head, or widespread pain throughout the head, evacuate with medicines the head moderately, and administer the other treatment which I have mentioned in the preceding chapters; and if this does not benefit, then cauterize in two ways: with acute medicine that burns, or with a cautery.</start_of_turn
Better is to cauterize with acute medicine than to take an amount of alum, to soak it, and to remove the extremities of it from both heads.</start_of_turn And immediately prick the area of pain in the temple with a lancelet that goes in until it reaches the bony area, leaving the corden hidden.
And press over it [the painful area] with a stopcock to reduce the tension, and leave it for three hours; then remove the ligature and draw out the blood, and leave the wound covered for two or three days, and place your hand over the area until the pain subsides
And care for that which is affected until it is healed.
And if you wish, know that many medicines combat these which I have written about in the treatise on combatting medicines.
May the cautery be carried out according to this manner: fire for cautery of this kind:
... and is called a closed claw, which has a head like a claw in which there is a slight curvature, and at the end of it there is a small prominence.
And place your hand over the area of pain, and hold your hand – so that the wound which is left does not stick – and draw out the fire little by little with speed.
And if the quantity of blood that is adhered to the corden is great, as much as the majority of it, elevate your hand so that the artery which is left does not adhere, so that there is no flow of blood
And soak the wound in salt water and place it over the area, and leave it for three days; then remove the dressing from the wound and cover the area with a wet dressing, and care for the area until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize at the edge of the cuticle according to the cautery, and keep yourself away from the incision of the artery in this migration properly not-ancient.
Chapter four
Of cautery of ancient migration
When you have cured the migration by the means we have mentioned in the previous treatment, and by the divisions of the diseases, and you do not take advantage of the treatment, and sometimes for the disease which does not suffice to it with the first cautery with medicine or the cautery with fire, then leave the cautery iron on the nail until it is whitened, because it signifies over the area of pain along the length of which is the majority of the finger, or whatever; and remove your hand for a moment and press that area until you have incised the artery and reached the bone
However necessary is that you take care of the continuity of the mandible, which is unlucky for biting, and that the nerve which is bad is not adhered and that no spasm occurs.
And if it is about the custody and caution of the flow of blood of the artery that is cut, which is feared, and above all that which ignores what is done and is negligent; leave the operation to the beginning
And I come to remind you of the regimen of the flow of blood concerning the cut of the artery according to their manner, in the place of this book
And if you see this disease that this cautery does not suffice and you see that the limb of the patient is tolerable, cauterize that in the middle part of the head as we have recounted, and care for the wound until it is healed
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the stretching of the artery with two hooks, and this is a better cautery and more reliable
Chapter five
Of the cautery of the pains of the heel
When in the heel there is pain from cold and it is cured by means of laxatives and by the other cure which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not gone, then leave the fire of the cautery, and this is the one which has no point, of which this is the form:
And immediately prick around the fire, and keep the fire moving around the whole heel as if it were rolling, or in the circle of any vessel if the pain is in any place Along with you the cautery of the root of the heel a little at a time because you have marked the area with the hand.
And if you have made nine punctures throughout the heel, and what is that? And immediately care for the wounds until they are healed.
Chapter six
From cautery of the tumor.
The tumor which is cured by cautery is nothing other than the specia which comes from inflammation, as we have said in the divisions of diseases.</end_of_turn>
Avoid cautery of the specia which must be dried or which causes spasm of the nerve.</end_of_turn>
When you have cured that tumor of the tumor, and you have pulled out the hair and cauterized, and you have confirmed that the pain has gone away, then cover the wound with three cauteries: the first you must make at the root of the hair, the second a little further away from the root, and the third at the junction of two lips.</end_of_turn
And stop the bleeding with the cautery against the side of the wound, because excessive bleeding is only seen in the part that is being cured.</end_of_turn
And the way of cautery is that you cauterize that which is causing the bleeding at the root of the hair plus a little above the nail, and in the temple another, the length of which should be according to the length of the finger, and stop your hand with the cautery until the quantity of the matter of the specia of the blood clot has been consumed.</end_of_turn
And this is the way of the cautery, and it is the specia of the knife, the form of which is like a table.</end_of_turn> More especially, because in this way you can see it for yourself; and cover that with more than superfluous fat a little.</end_of_turn
And cover the wound with that which is denanting to go away when it is healed.</end_of_turn
End of Document.</end_of_turn>
From cautery of ancient apoplexy.</end_of_turn
When the apoplexy is ancient and you have cured that which we have said and do not confirm your medicine and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize that which is with four cauteries: over all the nails of the foot; and as we have said at the root of the hair and in the middle of the head; and at the root of the beard.</end_of_turn And the manner of the cautery is sufficient as we have said.</end_of_turn
And it is already cauterized over the mouth of the stomach; and it is better later; and do the same with the cure that proceeds.</end_of_turn
End of Document.</end_of_turn
From cautery of immediate oblivion caused by inflammation.</end_of_turn
Cover that the patient has given to the patient at the beginning with large jars and pills that serve to moderate.</end_of_turn
And cover the whole head of the patient and stop his teeth by placing his gums on the plaster as described in the treatise on plasters.</end_of_turn
And stop any herbs, because that is the manner of the cautery.</end_of_turn And do the same according to that method or the which I have already said.</end_of_turn
And therefore if for these people it is good; and if not, then do three cauteries at the back of the foot, which depend from the most superior part of the head to the most distant part of the heel.</end_of_turn And stop between each cautery the greatness of the finger, and do the cure of the cautery with that which proceeds.</end_of_turn
More if you become addicted and the patient is able to tolerate it, then do the cautery in the middle of the head; and if you wish to make greater addition, then cauterize that over the two nails.</end_of_turn
Do the cure as soon as it is healed; and let the cautery be olive oil according to the manner which is said to be appropriate.</end_of_turn
End of Document.</end_of_turn
From cautery of nails and from softening of all the body.</end_of_turn
Cover that you are processing in the moderation of the head with jars and with that which we have said; and cover the head of the patient, and cauterize that which is cauterized in the middle of the head, and over all the nails of the head, and over the back of the neck, and three cauteries over the vertebrae of the spine.</end_of_turn
And if it is necessary in the disease of softening of the body of the limbs that this and the maladies tolerate and the disease is strong, then cauterize that which is with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the buttocks, and then cauterize until it is consumed by the clot of blood, and remove the hand.

When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and great spasm, then cauterize that which we have said which has immediate paralysis.
When the cause of melancholy is superfluous diminishing to melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then give him to drink water which softens the head of the patient according to what has been said in the division.
When the cause of melancholy is superfluous diminishing to melancholy, and the patient's body is humid, then remove the hair from the patient's head, and then make a decent burn on the circle, and do that in the middle of the head

Incideys am cauteri totas las venas e arcerias las quals so dejos la codena; e sian les cauteris en aquela lonh en la latitut de las templas.
And keep away from the blood flow of the saint when it is cauterized; and if you see that there is blood flow of the saint, stop any medicine, which is for you possible.
And indeed I know the knowledge which is in the extraction of arteries and in the exclusion of those and care for the blood flow of the saint
And every vein is cauterized at the neck leaving two bones with two cauteries remaining in place.
Chapter XIII.
Of the cautery of ancient tears
When tears of the eyes are ancient and have settled in the veins and arteries which are in the area manifested on the outside of the head and it has been verified that these are superfluous fatty phlegmas, then cauterize that which we have recounted in the chapter concerning the beginning of water which is in the gut of the eyes, and on the middle part of the head and on two cauteries on the neck leaving two temples, and two cauteries on the neck leaving two bones. And if you disagree with the addition, then cauterize that which is in all the length of the eyebrow on the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery
Chapter XIV
Of the cautery of the stench of the nose
When your physician has said what we have said in the division and does not benefit from your medicine, then you appear and give to the patient to drink three nights the broth of the sick; and approach his head and cauterize the middle and the olive tree And indeed cauterize that which is cauterized clove with two cauteries on the two eyebrows leaving the hair a little bit.
And keep away from the thread that you do not burn that one
And concerning the clove this is the way to do it
Chapter XV
Of the cautery of the softening of the eyelids of the eyes
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by disease or by humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a cautery like this lunar; and this is the way to do it:
And if you do, cauterize that over the two eyebrows a little bit with two cauteries throughout, and they will be elongated from the temples And the length of each cautery is according to the amount of the eyebrow
And do not press too much your hand with the cautery, but according to the amount that the third part of the eyelid is adhered
Chapter XVI
Of the cautery of the eyelid of the eye when it is converted to black spots and puts a finger on the eye
When the spots of the eye are converted to black spots even though you put a finger on the eye, cauterize in those two ways, that is either by doing it or with medicine that is a burn
If you do the cautery with fire, command the patient to drink until the spots disappear as those that are made by the flame; and if you put your finger there you must strengthen the eyes of the patient with a bandage so that it is not painful until the spots are born
When they are born and equalized, then pause the head of the patient over the gut of the eye, and approach again over the eyelid of the eye of the patient with a pinch, with the signal which is according to the figure of a dead leaf, and the beginning of the signal is near the spots
And indeed pause for a while in the mucus in albumin of glue on the eye
And indeed do the cautery in this way.
And indeed cauterize over the figure which you have marked, little by little, in green veins, until the surface of the heel which is like a dead leaf is consumed, all in appearance properly
The sign of the completion of the work is that you see the eyelid of the eye already being contracted and the spots of the eye already being raised beyond the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand and place it over his head for three days, and then pause over the area until the scar is healed. And then care for that until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
May be if it returns for any reason, then do not hesitate, and gently palpate, for the hour it will be enough to cauterize it all as you did at first.</start_of_turn
May be if it swells in the palpation leave it, for the hour cauterize that until it is elevated to its natural place and is equal, and that the parts do not stink.</start_of_turn
May be cauterize with medicine that commands the patient to rest the parts until they are prolonged and equal, and then apply a piece of lint like a feather of mirtle.</start_of_turn
And take sponges soaked in wine and cause life to go up one.</start_of_turn namely.</start_of_turn> or what is that, mix those things up, and do what is necessary so that it does not become inflamed; and expand a little of that liquid over the paper which is put like a feather of mirtle, and leave it over the wound edge in the belly, and put the patient's head in the chest.</start_of_turn
And leave him say about the medicine and do that a little and do not leave it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, which is in them just like fire.</start_of_turn
Therefore when he perceives that the other bite has ceased, the hour reads the medicine and do that which he was told to do; when the bite ceases, then remain the medicine and wash the wound with water; and consider that sometimes the swelling is already raised just like after being burned by the fire or incision, for the hour this is good; and if it does not return concerning the medicine over that place where it has not been pressed, and it is not wrinkled until the operation is healed and the wound is contracted.</start_of_turn
And then pause over the area around the border until the scar of the incision is eradicated, and then care for that which is left deaf or otherwise until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And it is necessary for you to know that you must keep your operation under strict surveillance so that in the wound does not fall again the medicine, and if the swelling is almost gone for several days or if any cause of the parts pressing on the wound comes back, the hour repeats your medicine over that place where the swelling is gone, just like you did at the beginning, and prevent it until it is healed.</start_of_turn
This is the feather of mirtle.</start_of_turn
And you know that the humors of men are diverse according to their magnitude and their smallness, and therefore according to what is done your contraction.</start_of_turn
And do not be ashamed of the way of teaching this in this art.</start_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</start_of_turn>
Of the cauterization of the fistula which is in the tear duct of the eye.</start_of_turn
When you cure the fistula with that which we have said in the divisions of the diseases and you do not confer your care, the hour covers that you cauterize according to this manner: command the patient to rest their head on their chest, and keep the head of them any minister between the thighs in such a way that it is neither mauged nor agitated on the head.</start_of_turn
And then pause the limb immersed in water or in mucus over the eye.</start_of_turn
And then ignite the cautery of which this is the form:</start_of_turn
that is, if it is conquered, like the shape of a cane or like the head of a pin, from one extremity to the other where the cauterization is done.</start_of_turn
And if you go, penetrate from one extremity to the other.</start_of_turn And if you wish, go like that too.</start_of_turn
Better is he who is conquered to the work.</start_of_turn
And then press the fistula if it is open, and take away the dirt and dry that.</start_of_turn And if it is not open, the hour opens that and extracts the pus from it.</start_of_turn
And so I pause with the cautery over the area which is to be ignited, and I put a little distance between my hand and the patient's nose, so that my hand does not move or the patient becomes restless, and I pause the cautery in the gray matter and restore the sensation which has been lost.
And if the burn initially penetrates the bone, it is not good; otherwise, repeat the burn once or twice if necessary. Leave the area for three days, and then pause over that area and surround it with lint until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
If several days have passed and it is still not healed, pause the acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and recovered as recommended in the capital chapter.</end_of_turn>
Another method for cautery of fistula is as follows: enter the fistula and cauterize there, and then pause in that crease of the skin which is the shape of the fistula. Then put the quantity of lead that you consider necessary on that area, and keep your hand firmly in place, without causing discomfort to the patient, so that the lead does not reach the nose; and keep the hand of the patient covered with wool or in water, so that the lead adheres to the fistula and heals that part miraculously.</end_of_turn
And if the fistula is healed with the cautery and treatment that we have mentioned, it is not good; otherwise, it is necessary to administer medicine through the nose and reduce the fistula to the root of the nose as it comes in its proper place.</end_of_turn

Many veins are cut accidentally in the lips, and especially in the lips of children.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you have cured those fissures as we have said in the divisions and do not neglect your treatment, then I order you to burn a little cautery in this way:</end_of_turn
And be the curvature of the area according to the thickness of the skin.</end_of_turn
Then pause that immediately over those fissures until the burn reaches the base of the fissures.</end_of_turn

When there is swelling in the uvula or palate or the roots of the teeth, and there is pus and pain, and the swelling is broken, and the fistula is formed, and you do not neglect the treatment, then cover that burn according to the quantity that is received in the fistula, and put that flame in the hole of the fistula, and keep your hand over it until the burning flame reaches the base of the fistula, and after that make an incision once or twice; and take care of that as we have said of the treatment until it is healed.</end_of_turn

Of cautery of the teeth and mollification of the veins.</end_of_turn
When the veins are swollen with humidity and the teeth are painful, and you treat them with medicines and do not confer relief, then I order you to place the thumb of the patient on the tip of the tongue and then burn with the cautery in the form that you will be told, since you must keep the hand away from the tooth so that the burn does not reach the root of the tooth.
And withdraw your hand and repeat the burn several times as you please.</end_of_turn
And keep the patient's mouth full of salt water and keep it there for an hour, and then remove it, because the painful tooth is calmed and the softened gum is strengthened and the moisture that was corrupted is dried up.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXI.</end_of_turn
Of cautery for toothache.</end_of_turn
When toothache is caused by cold, or is sharp or burning, or does not respond to treatment with medicine, then I order you to burn in two ways: either around the cow's foot, or over the flame.</end_of_turn
The cautery is applied to the border of the wound and a bundle of cows' hair is placed into the hole of iron. Then a coat is taken and wrapped over the extremity of the limb, and the bundle of hair is immersed in the wound and rests upon the painful tooth until it is inflamed.
And in this way repeat the process until the virtue of the fire reaches the root of the tooth
And if you wish, immerse a bandage or cloth in the wound at the foot of the tooth, and place it over the painful tooth, and cover over that with the ignited iron until the iron reaches the depth of the curvature of the tooth.
However, more than the cautery with fire is to be aware of the quantity of charcoal or iron, and to make in the middle of them any swelling or discomfort, and that the degree of the fire does not reach the mouth of the patient.
And in this way cool the cautery in the shape of which it will come, and place it over the tooth and keep your hand over it until the cautery is inflamed; and do some herbs that the pain may be relieved today or tomorrow or the next day
And know that after the application of the cautery the patient should fill their mouth with good fat and keep it for an hour, and then remove it; this is the way of the cautery.</start_of_turn>
And cauterize as much as you can of the limb according to your ability.</start_of_turn>
And this is the way of the cannula:

Of the cautery of exostoses.</start_of_turn
When exostoses are of flexibility and cold humors and do not obey digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them mildly, the hour you ignite the cautery you must take two limbs covered so that the smoke from the cautery does not reach the other limb, and place the ignited iron over that abscess a herb, and another if you wish to digest it, until it reaches the depth of the abscess
And if the abscess is small, the hour you pause the cautery according to the quantity of the abscess, and leave it covered for three days and cover over it with a bandage until it is relieved of what the fire has consumed.</start_of_turn>
And take care that in this way the wound and limbs and cloths are clean until they are healed.</start_of_turn
Capital letter X equals twenty-three.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of the root of the tooth and the constriction of the jaw.</start_of_turn
When humidity is on the root of the tooth, and especially when it is cold, the hour you must evacuate the patient with laxatives at the beginning with medicines, and then cauterize that which is beyond the root of the tooth in the depressed area.</start_of_turn
And take care that the cautery does not reach the bone or does not burn the pulp except for a little bit.</start_of_turn
And cauterize that which is beyond the other cautery is beyond the joint of the collar in the back of the vertebra of the tooth.</start_of_turn And the cautery of the tooth must be like the preceding one.</start_of_turn
And take care that what precedes is healed before it is healed.</start_of_turn
Capital letter X equals twenty-three.</start_of_turn
Of the cautery of toothache and cough.</start_of_turn
When cough and toothache are of cold humors and the toothache has neither fever nor spasm and is an old toothache, the hour you cauterize two cauteries over the spur of the lower jaw and between the teeth; and another cautery in the middle of the foot between two nipples; and the cautery must be like the preceding one.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, make the puncture of the cautery with the point called puncture, the shape of which is described in the puncture of toothache.</start_of_turn
And be careful that there are no cavities around those; and take care that what precedes is healed before it is healed.</start_of_turn
And it has been said that three ramps must be made before the cautery is complete in this way: three cauteries according to this manner.
Capitol XXV
Capitol XXV
When the head of the assistant is displaced by the action of greasy humors and is not fixed at the time of the convalescence, you must displace it again when it has returned as it is customary. Indeed, as we have testified, when the head is displaced for the first time, you must first reduce the dislocation, and then restore the patient either forward or backward; and raise the knee which is in the groin area to the parts below your left hand if the joint is displaced in the groin.
And so on, ignite two cautery tips; this is the way to do it:
And so on, cauterize the knee until it penetrates the other side; and the figure of cautery will be that of four cautery tips.
And each hair is adjusted according to this count and because there are eight cautery tips
And so on, keep your hand over the cautery for a while with salt, and then make the patient adhere to tranquility, and the limb will not be painful for any time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and it is necessary, then cauterize over the muscle at the base of the thumb or over several cautery points, so that the joint is confirmed and the humidity is expelled and the patient is healed.
Capitol XXVVI
Of cautery of the stomach.
When there is cold and fat humors in the stomach that expand when they touch the outside of the body and multiply the worms, and if you continue your treatment methods and do not confirm it, then you must place the patient face down on the bed and extend your hands and legs, and then cauterize with three cautery tips: on one cautery leave the feet for the quantity of a thumb at the base of the thumb, and on two cautery tips leave the two sides of the cautery, until you form a triangular cautery figure; and stretch between those that are not adjusted, which will cause great pain.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the breadth of the knee
And the figure of the cautery should be as follows: thus one adds. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this is a circular cautery according to this form:
And cauterize the stomach punctate where it is sensitive: and that you mark on the stomach point according to the quantity you wish on the hair, and then cauterize that point there; and take care of that point with the care that precedes until it is healed
Capitol XXVVII
Of cautery of the painful heel
When there is pain in the heel due to cold or for fat or for excessive windiness that the normal heel expansion is extracted by excessive discharge, and when you have treated the patient as we have said and have not confirmed it, then you must place the patient face down on his neck and mark with three cautery tips according to this form and this quantity on the heel beyond the hip bones, holding the heel of the patient.
And the space between each two cautery tips should be according to the thickness of the finger, and the cautery tips should be according to the length of the limb that is being treated
Do not tighten over the cautery wounds too much
And if the quantity of liquid that is spurted is equal to the quantity of the big toe of the patient, and it is not more adjusted; and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then keep him still, because he has already extended his legs, and lift his buttocks up high
And you can also cauterize these cautery tips with a pointed cautery, when it is at your skill and prudence in the art.
And take care that you do not overdo the cautery, and that you cauterize the entirety of the heel so that you cauterize all the body and reach the intestines, because the heel here is subtle; and be careful that you do not burn.

Capital XVIII. From the perforation of the Achilles tendon with a cautery.</end_of_turn>
When the tendon or apophysis in the foot is extruded and one wants to know if that apophysis is in the bone of the foot or in the sheath of the limb, if it is in the bone of the foot, the disease becomes heavy and the pain is acute.</end_of_turn>
And if it is in the sheath of the foot, with great pain which often makes doctors give up on the treatment.</end_of_turn
Therefore the disease must be supported on the heel; and immediately before the perforation of the apophysis, and then apply the cautery to the part which is similar to a rag in shape, as it is described in the other page.</end_of_turn And burn with the cautery until all the surrounding area is cauterized, until it reaches the cartilage, until the wound is healed.</end_of_turn
And take care of the other apophyses until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And do not use this method of cautery except for those that a physician has studied in the art of medicine and in most of which many diseases have been overcome; indeed, in some of these the risk is great concerning this operation, but we must read what is written to us and it is better.</end_of_turn

Of the cautery of the plantar surface.</end_of_turn
Say that the ancient cauteries of the roots of Aristotle on plantar frega are done according to this manner: take from the roots of Aristotle a piece of the length of a finger that is found, and which is of the thickness of a thumb.</end_of_turn
And immediately immerse that in oil and put it in the fire, and immediately cauterize for a cautery in that place which is between the continuation of the heel towards the ankle; and with two small cauteries leave guiding, one slightly declining towards the part that is below the beard, and two cauteries that decline between the fifth rib and the heel, declining slightly towards the parts behind; and another cauterization in the middle of the foot; and another over the stomach; and three cauterizations on the back parts; and one cautery in that place which is between the two buttocks, and two cauteries on the two sides of the foot, leaving the cautery that is between two buttocks.</end_of_turn
And do not leave your hand over the cautery, but rather on the surface of the work.</end_of_turn
And indeed we say that these are the ancient methods of those men who use a cautery of iron resembling a ray and fire, and apply it to that place which is between the ribs, until that apophysis is reached and is cured, as we have said in the apophysis of the foot.</end_of_turn
However, in this perforation with the cautery, do not be afraid, because it happens so often in the fistula that does not heal.</end_of_turn>
Capital XXX.</end_of_turn
Of the cautery of the heel.</end_of_turn
When you have cured the disease of the heel according to what we have said in the division and you do not fear the treatment, then the cautery on it is done in three ways, which are all safe, namely that you make three or four incisions according to the length of the heel according to the figure of the cauteries of the foot, as it has been described.</end_of_turn
And between each cautery the thickness of a finger or a little more, and the manner of the cautery should be the same as that which we have said in the cautery of the foot.</end_of_turn
Do not leave your hand over the cautery; and the disease must be even above the heel two.</end_of_turn
And another manner of cautery is that you ignite the cautery having two incisions, which cause we have mentioned in the chapter on dislocation of the muscle, and elevate the area which is at the end of the heel towards the heel bone so as to keep the heel from the left side of the disease.</end_of_turn
And let your elevation be such as to elevate the area according to the length of the limb, so that the cauteries may be made according to the width of the body.</end_of_turn
And immediately withdraw the two incisions, ignite not, in that place where the area has penetrated the heel of the other part.</end_of_turn
And immediately draw out the cautery; thus four cauteries are made.
If you wish, cauterize at the root of the nail without causing three veins to bleed.
And immediately treat the cautery once it has bled for a few days, because it is different from the other previous causes of the treatment.

On the cautery of hydropic [disease].
The cautery does not take in hydropic disease but in alcinte indeed
When you have cured the hydropic with the methods of treatment which we have said in the division, and you do not confer your treatment, then know that four cauteries should be made around the belly and one on the stomach, and one on the heel, and two between the vertebrae of the two, and one in the root of the foot, and one on the stomach And the quantity of the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the spiciness of the wound
And immediately place the cautery over so that it does not bleed for a long time.
Do not evacuate the patient from treatment immediately after the cautery because it is necessary for them to understand two things, and stay with them until they have recovered
The shape of the cautery that is to be made on the belly is like a claw according to the shape of the lesion, and that which is to be made on the two olives is like the preceding one according to its shape

On the cautery of feet and the cushions
When the feet are swollen in hydrosis and are filled with salty urine, know that the feet must be cauterized on the two sides of the foot except for the area between the heel and the ankle, and hold your hand over the cautery and do not move it; and immediately raise your hand, do not return it, because the salty urine remains
It is thus cauterized: And immediately make two cauteries on the two cushions, and on any other part make the cautery at the tip of the cautery that is cut And the cautery should be made according to the length of the cushion: leave one end of the cushion and the other under the middle of the cushion; and make two cauteries on every cushion
Leave the wound open for a long time so that any urine may drain from it
And immediately treat with those causes which we have said

When the chest is cold and humid because of the cold humors that enter, it is the digestive and retaining virtue, which are in the stomach and in the intestines, and it is cured by the methods of treatment and is not necessary, and sometimes the patient suffers from cauteries that exhibit virtue, then immediately cauterize the great cautery over the great stomach as it was said before concerning the cautery of the stomach, and on the circle and four cauteries around the small intestine, and a claw-shaped cautery; and a cautery over the liver or two cauteries
And if sometimes the exhaling humors and the patient tolerate it, then immediately cauterize that on the flank and on the abdomen, and firmly adjusting two cauteries on the stomach and near the navel, which is a perfect cure for the swelling of which you do not err

Burn with the cautery from the heel towards the toes, and immediately remove the black eschar.
When you burn the heel, immediately remove the cautery from the area that is like nails. Return the burning cautery between the toes of the affected limb, and place your hand over the area until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do two incisions, if there are two, because if they are great, then burn each one as we have recounted, and immediately care for those which cause them from the burns until they are healed.
And if you burn with a great cautery on anything, it is better to delay treatment
The treatment is finished.
When fistulas are caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, they are beneficial in nature and disappear in the parts of the body.
When the nature does not obey the work that we have recommended in its place, and the patient is terrified, whether he is healthy or sick.
Therefore, when one sees a fistula in the nature that is old, corrupt the blood and putrefying humors, it is better that one tries to cover it up rather than uncover it, and immediately surround the quantity of the depth of it as much as one can with the front part that one is trying to save.
Like nails And immediately put the burning cautery on the fistula, according to the quantity with which the attempt is made.
And repeat this process until the corrupt parts have been consumed, two or three times, according to the quantity of your need
Beware of burning nerves and veins; or if the fistula is in the bladder or the belly, immediately guard the area of these organs; do not proceed until the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating.
And immediately care for the area until it is healed
And if the area is sealed, and if the matter has been removed from it, and you remain like this for a long time, know that it is already completely healed
And if the matter is not taken away from it, know that it is penetrating or in the preon of it, or that it will come to be remembered in its area

About the cautery of the tonsils
When in the tonsils there is pain due to cold or excessive wind, and in order to relieve the patient’s suffering, it is necessary to burn over the tonsils with a cautery over each tonsil where there is a visible bluish discoloration.
And burn with little distance between them, so that there will be three burns in a row, and therefore will be more beneficial
The treatment is finished
About the cautery of the bladder
When there is swelling in the bladder due to cold and humidity and the patient does not retain the urine, it is necessary to burn in the lower part of the bladder near the pubic bone, on the side of the little toe, and on the other side of the uterus.
And the length of each burn is according to the degree of the swelling; and burn with two cauteries if necessary
And the burn must be made deep enough

About the cautery of the armpit
When there is swelling in the armpit due to cold and humidity, and the armpit is painful and the menstrual blood is corrupted, and it is delayed in its discharge, and there is pain due to the heat of the armpit, it is necessary to burn the area with three cauteries around the navel, as we said concerning the bladder; and with a burn over the lower part of the shoulder, or with two burns. The burn must be deep enough
The treatment is finished
About the cautery of dislocation of the ankle
When moist mucus humors spread to the ankle joint, and cause swelling of the limb, a sign of this is that the space between them is prolonged compared to their usual position. The ankle joint is displaced towards the side which is painful
Therefore, when you cauterize the painful area of the ankle, do so in a circular fashion, since you have already recognized that this is an inflamed area, and in order that the surrounding area does not suffer further damage.
And the cautery which follows is the shape of the incision of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not at your disposal, then do three cauteries with an olive-sized cautery.
And the cautery should be performed according to the amount of spiciness of the entire area; and pay attention to those that are healthy.

On cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When there is pain in the ankle, caused by cold and moist humors, the disease is cured with what has been said above and not by confections, and when it has passed, you should take care that the patient does not have excessive humors in the body, but rather that you cauterize it.
And the method of cautery is two-fold: either with medicinal powders or with fire.
Thus in two learned methods, one of which is to cauterize over the ankle with three triangular cauteries as follows; and do it with sufficient depth And the distance between each cautery should be equal to the thickness of the finger, and if it is an olive or a large cautery
Some physicians cauterize over the middle of the ankle along the edge of the ankle bone because there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize around the circumference which precedes the shape of the ankle dislocation, and which is a continuous circle and burns away the spiciness of the entire area
This is the method of cautering in the case of pain that is limited to the ankle and does not extend to the space between the thighs
If it extends to the space between the thighs, then do two cauteries on the surface of the thigh over the painful area, and one cauterization over the hip for four fingers a little below the waistline.
If the cautery is too severe, and the depth of the cautery is according to the amount of spiciness of the area
If the disease extends as far as the feet, then cauterize here where the pain is felt with three or four cauteries or as many as you deem necessary
If the disease extends to the thighs, then do one severe cautery here where the pain is felt
And keep in mind in all cauterization that you do not burn nerves or great vessels, and that by this you do not cause further damage or contraction of the disease.
I have already seen several of these who, having cauterized over the hip and completed the cauterization, had the thigh bone inflamed until the tumor achieved the foot, and the bone was perforated and corrupted throughout the limb Therefore, take strong stomach acid, and take care of death.<end_turn>
And if the pain is in two places, cauterize each one according to this method.<end_turn>
And they say the wise men of ankle cauterization are like circles of iron whose circumference is the measure of a palm; and the depth should be as deep as the kernel of a date or less.
And join those circles so that they form a third; and the distance between them should be equal to the thickness of a nail; and these circles should be closely bound to each other; and this is their shape:
Do the same with fire ignited in the firebox so that it smokes and sparks, and keep your hand steady over the ankle, with the disease resting on the heel of the foot. And so cauterize with three cauteries around the circumference of the ankle
And so keep that area for three days; then plaster that area around the edges and leave the wound open for several days; and finally care for that which is inflamed until it is healed.
Indeed Albucasis: or, friends, in this sort of cautery we have little experience, and for that reason few have found what is useful regarding it.</end_of_turn>
Moreover of the many cauteries that we use, this one is the most painful, and find in this one the place of its action.</end_of_turn>
Moreover of the many cauteries that we use, this one remains with medicines as long as two circles are made having a hole pierced in the middle through which the contents of the bag escape; the length of the burn on the surface of the limb should be two hazelnuts or so.</end_of_turn
And if the space between the great toe and the quantity of thickness of the finger; then open up the space below and above, and keep it filled according to this measure:
And so place your hand over the ankle of the patient and compress your hand over the ankle; then take warm water and pour it between two circles, and the quality of that which is in the centre should be like that of a small fire, and keep that for the quantity of an hour, and suffer the pain of the patient the bite and the swelling of the limb — for that other bite is like fire — until the bite ceases.</end_of_turn>
And so lift up your hand with the instrument and wash the warm water from the whole ankle with cold water.</end_of_turn
And so keep that area for three days and pause on that border until the blackening of the swelling has disappeared, and leave it open for several days, and care for it until it has healed. This is the end of the treatment.</end_of_turn
And finally care for that which is inflamed until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if the pain is extended to the groin or the thigh, keep the limb in such a position as to contain water as is done in the ankle swelling.</end_of_turn
This is the method of warm water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.</end_of_turn> Recipe of alkali and caustic not extinct of both parts, take one part each, and grind them together and pause in a new water from which the part that remains is perforated with a small hole according to the quantity that enters into it.</end_of_turn
And pause for a while the other water of the wave sent another wave coming, and get on that alkali and caustic alive from lukewarm water which takes those for a finger, and when you have compressed those with the thumb for good compression, and leave the rest that comes out of the water sharp in the part of the foot to the wave going out.</end_of_turn
And so adjust all that water, and get another caustic alive and another alkali renewed, because that every hour that it is left without movement causes strong pain, which is administered in surgical operations of medicine and in cauterization of the other members, because this operation is like fire.</end_of_turn
And so of the many medicines which are cauterized widely, some are like turmeric and alum, and caustic like vinegar that is dissolved in water, which are more useful and less harmful than those that are pure.</end_of_turn
And thus relates an ancient man the operation and care with which the pain of ankle and sciatica is cured, and magnifies more than enough to be of that, and says that no other care is necessary, and that it is healed by a single bath as recommended, for that strong thread in the bath already suffices for that.</end_of_turn
And it is that it should be taken of certain green herbs, and if it is not found green, take recent figs; and do not grind it with a little gray, and put it on the ankle in which the pain is, or in the groin, or in the thigh, and bind it.</end_of_turn
And leave it on for the quantity of three hours or for the quantity that the patient can tolerate of the swelling.</end>
And so put that in the bath and therefore when the limb is tanned, take that out into the sun, because the pain ceases and it is healed.</end_of_turn
And know that it is not necessary to use all of these cauteries with these medicines, but only for the evacuation of the limb.</end_of_turn
Moreover I say that when the vein of the goat is cut, the cautery is performed; take advantage of this well; and make the cautery in this manner: take wool and soak it in oil against the cold, and put it between the toes of the foot and between the bones.</end_of_turn
And thus take a dry goat's horn and burn that which is within until it is fat; and then place it on the wool and read the extent until it is extended. And do the same again, and do not cease until the sensation of the biting pain has reached the ankle and rests the pain
And this method of cautery is called the cautery of cows.
Chapter XXXII.
Of the cautery of two pains
Some causes of joint pain are in two parts, as in the case of inflammation or percussion or excessive evacuation, and for such causes as these, by infusion of fiery and humid matter
And do not burn except for this single kind which is fat for the effusion of fiery matter
Therefore cover, and evacuate the evil with small pills placed under the pain, which should be fat on the two parts where the pain is three lines according to their width, because they are not to be attempted in any line or to cauterize or burn more, according to the quantity of the patient's tolerance and the virtue of the treatment
And let the cautery be fat with cautery of points
And if you wish, burn with three cauteries or with four in the middle according to this manner:
Chapter XXIIC
Of the cautery at the beginning of inflammation
Many times this disease affects small children; and a sign of the beginning of it in children is that it affects their bones and causes them to bend forward and elevate and move awkwardly
And also in the back one finds a slippage of the vertebra of the two and the ribs of the same which already begins to dominate over the other vertebrae
And therefore when you are sometimes in this situation and you wish to prohibit it, then burn that which is circular according to this manner: that it surrounds the cautery over the whole part of the vertebra equalling
And if you wish, burn in the circumference of the vertebra with two point cauteries or three And let the points be close together
And take care of the area until it is healthy with the water that we have said.
Take care that the cautery is not administered in inflammation that is fat for spasms of nerves
Chapter XLV
Of the cautery of gout and of joint pain
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And therefore when gout is cured by means of treatment and the pains are not left, the pain is removed by the cautery
And you burn that close evacuation in the circumference of the foot joint with two point cauteries.
And let the burn be olive oil in which this is the form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery And if the pains rise within the bones or to the other joints, and when these things happen, then burn that which is over each bone with three cauteries or over the whole part with this olive oil cautery
And if these cauteries are not enough for you, then burn that which is over your hand with the cautery without causing too much damage to the surrounding area, and send for the physician who has the knowledge of the disease
And if the pain increases in the bone and the two together, then administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the previous chapter
And if the pain is only on one side and is severe, then prick in the circumference of the bone as if it were a wheel, prick in those two lines.
And if the pain remains in these places, then prick on the circumference of the bones over each rib and over the nail of the hand
If pain suddenly increases in the joints and nearby tissues, or if it affects the bones or muscles, it is customary to cauterize them throughout their extent.
Do not evacuate the patient with excessive force, but rather with good regimen and the application of medicines, for if it is good regimen and the inflammation is calmed, it is evacuated with this pointed cautery without harming, God willing.</end_of_turn>

Of cautery of ruptures.</end_of_turn>
When the bone is fractured in the ankle and saying the bones are loosening from the heel bone, and when this is imminent, then command the patient to lie still in bed and use soft materials so that the wound does not worsen from the belly of the foot.</end_of_turn
And follow the patient between your thighs on the bed, and command them to keep the foot away from the bed until the bone is set or the heel bone or the bone and the marrow appear fractured.</end_of_turn
And return that which is between the thighs, and touch the fracture on the fifth bone with a sign that resembles the half of a circle to the upper parts of the body.</end_of_turn
And thus ignite the cautery, of which this is the form:
until it is hot and gets sparks.</end_of_turn Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.</end_of_turn
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.</end_of_turn
And thus suspend the cautery on that sign with your hand over the cautery, and do this until you have set the fifth bone within the middle of the foot; and repeat this until you have achieved this in the first attempt within the bone.</end_of_turn
And watch diligently of the color of the intestine during the cautery, that you do not burn that intestine so that on the patient no comes any death or other great harm.</end_of_turn
And know that when you have finished the cautery do not neglect the bone, do not trust your operation.</end_of_turn
And that the cautery of children be subtle according to their age and measure.</end_of_turn
And take care of the area of the cautery for three days with borders so that the burn of the fire is healed.</end_of_turn
And take care of those who are beside him until they are healed.</end>
And the patient should rest on the bed for forty days until the area is healed and the wound is closed.</end>
And that you abstain from nourishing him according to the length of time of his recovery, and that the intestine does not escape from the effort to recover.</end
And when you want to take him away after forty days, administer him nourishing things suitably, and keep him for another forty days.</end
And be mindful of work and the replenishment of food and drink, and of a harsh voice, for when you use this regimen of healing the whole patient will be healed.</end
And I say the healing of fractures in other parts of the body, and so from the beginning, and you will know that when you cauterize the fracture of that with which we have spoken, round as much as it is, and that which is exhumed from the marrow just like the third part of it; and take care of that which we have said, and do not be negligent.</end
And I have already said that the first fracture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, because it is signed with a touch.</end>
and is stopped like a line that is further from the width of the fracture, and another line from the heel; and put your hand on with a nail cautery, because the first cautery is more curious and better.</end<end_turn>

Of cautery of torsion.</end
When the limb is twisted due to an accident or for percussion, and pain persists for a long time and you do not feel any improvement with treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.</end
The cautery should be performed according to the size and shape of the member, its hardness and elasticity, and the location of the twist and the pain.
If the first cautery is not successful, do not hesitate to repeat it; for it is often the case that these pains are caused by points on the limb itself, which must be burned close to the source of the pain so that the disease is cured.</end_of_turn>

Of the cautery of leprosy.</end_of_turn
Some authors burn the cautery excessively, with great enthusiasm, while others do not burn it enough; and often it is the leprosy which is caused by the putrefaction of fat and melancholy.</end_of_turn
And therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider whether the leprosy is acute or chronic; and cure the former with two cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and one at the back of the head, over the eyebrows; and two on the temples; and one on the nape of the neck or on the shoulder.</end_of_turn
And finally, place your hand over the cautery a a little distance from the bone so that a small wound is left, from which the scales will be loosened; thus the emission of thick vapor will be alleviated from it; and burn over the heel as required.</end_of_turn
And if the leprosy has already spread over the body and appears to be manifest, then it is necessary that you burn in addition to those cauteries which we have said in the head; and burn over the tip of the nose, and two cauteries over the two cheekbones, and two over two vertebrae of the neck, and five over the vertebrae of the chest, and one over the breastbone, two over the armpits, one over each armpit, two over the elbows, two over the muscles, and two on the tendons of the legs; and burn over all the joints of the toes and feet, and over every nail of the toes, and over the sockets of the teeth.</end_of_turn
And take care not to burn the nerves which are on the thigh so that you do not burn those.</end_of_turn>
And many are cauterized with one cautery on the bone of the heel and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the heel.
Remember that the more cauteries you make, the greater the benefit and the greater the benefit; and remember that the body is already stupefaited by the disease, so that it does not feel pain even when it is being cauterized.</end_of_turn
And take care that the cauteries are large or small according to the limbs and the joints as it is preceded by the species of the instruments.</end_of_turn

When any limb is stiff or asleep and is cured with medicines, oils and plasters, and is not cured, then you burn that stiff limb with cauteries as it deserves, according to the greatness of the limb or the smallness of it.</end_of_turn
And the cautery should be made through the thickness of the hair a little.</end_of_turn And finally, take care that it is well healed until it is cured.</end_of_turn>
And many are cauterized for any sleep that has arisen in the toes and the feet, and in the vertebrae of the neck and you will see the sensation of the nerves that are in that limb and it will be relieved of the sleep.</end_of_turn

When cancer begins and swells, then cauterize that part which protrudes in a circle around the area which is affected, as if it were swollen
And say the learned that it is cauterized behind the outer cautery in the middle area; but in my opinion it is not seen here, because I believe that it is ulcerated, and I have already seen several veins that have been cauterized in this way.</end_of_turn>
And it is better to cauterize in the circle around that which has been mentioned above, or at the most cauterize the root.</end_of_turn>

When some adubilati are delayed in maturity, and this is because of excess fatness, or for the state of the illness, because it is old in decrepitude, or for little sickness, or for the time, and you wish to hasten the maturity of the adubilati; then cauterize in the circle of that little puncture marks; and immediately lay that which hinders its maturity.</end_of_turn>
But if you wish to make a perforation of that which is to be cauterized, then do so in the middle of the adubilati where the vein appears; and leave that in the middle of the adubilati until it has pierced the cord.</end_of_turn

Corrosion is a walking corruption in the limb, which consumes that which is like fire eating dry wood.</end_of_turn>
Therefore if sometimes that corrosion in the place where you suffer pain you cauterize with fire, then you must know how many nails you must put in that place according to how much it is corroded.</end_of_turn
And immediately cauterize all that remains until you have eradicated all the corruption and there remains no cause of it.</end_of_turn
And immediately lay that which hinders its maturity.

And immediately pause the flame over the knee, and then rotate your hand over the area of the knee until the cautery reaches the depth of the knee. And leave it like that for three days until it begins to swell And immediately plaster that with fresh herbs moistened with salt, and leave the plaster on that for one night, so that the cause of the pain will be eradicated from its roots.
And care for the limb with ointment of generative ointment until it is healed
And if it does not recover, and black spots appear on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then you must administer in those cavities with water, that is to say, take a sponge of willow or ivy or elderberry, and put that on the knee; and withdraw a little quantity of cold water from the sponge, and hold your hand, and rotate that with your hand all around, and press the margin of the sponge on the root of the knee, and reintroduce the cold water through the opening of the root; and wait for the patient for a little the bitterness of the cold water for an hour, and then remove that, because the knee will then be freed from its root
And so be with those who are with you until they all go away from all of whom they are in the body.
And care for those who remain after the root of the knee has been eradicated by the warmth of the ointments that cause the knee to swell

Of cautery of tremor.
When there is some tremor due to cold in the nerves or for excessive heat, or for another similar cause, then you must cauterize that with four cauteries or five over the spines of the two, between each spine with a cautery; and with a cautery on the feet and on the stomach

Of cautery of the accidental burn of the body.
When there is spilled blood in the body, and there are pus-filled boils which are caused by corrupt thick matter; therefore it is necessary at the beginning when it appears to cauterize over the whole head of the fistula with a fine needle and a vessel of mercury, the extremity of which is extended to the fire; or at the root of erotology longua; or with a slow cautery
And some boiled wounds are cauterized immediately at the beginning of their discharge in this way; and do not be afraid, for by interrupting the excess you will make those whole and healthy again
However, you must also take care that there is no further bleeding during the evacuation with flebotomy

Of cautery of the flux of blood from an accidental incision of an artery
Many veins bleed excessively from an incision of the plague which must be removed, or from an incision of abscesses or cautery of the limb, and in like manner it is difficult to stop that bleeding
Therefore when such a thing happens, immediately take your hand to the orifice of the artery, and pause over that until you have stopped the bleeding from the wound; and do not leave it until the bleeding has ceased
And immediately pause the fire of the cauteries a few and large, for many, and blow over those until they are no longer lit
And immediately take from those a little or a great one according to the limb and the wound from which the artery has been broken, over that vein tightly holding back the bleeding until the wound has closed, and withdraw the cautery until it is gone and restrict that blood.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifice of the artery when you have withdrawn the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from the cauteries which are prepared in the fire and do not stop doing that until the blood is restricted
And take care that you do not burn the nerves that are there, and that you come over the patient with another malady.
And you know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible in those situations to restrict the blood, and especially when the artery is large, except by four methods: or by cauterizing as we have said, or by extraction when it is not extracted, because when it is extracted the limbs are burnt and the blood is restricted, or that it is bound with thread or ligature for strong structure, or that it is supported by medicines of which the virtue is to restrict the blood; and that it is strengthened by dusting with powder or constriction descending
May he who administers gentle restraint from them, and stricture with a drape or by placing the cause in a position that combats and prevents recurrence, shall not cause further discomfort but rather benefit.
If he must go without a physician or medicine, when the hand or foot indicates the orifice of that vein as we have said, understand that the patient is at great risk of dying from the plague; do not delay; and having ascertained that the patient is not in imminent danger of death, sprinkle the wound with cold water of great coldness until the patient is congealed and hardened; and more than this do nothing unnecessary.</end_of_turn>
From incision and perforation and winds and of phlebotomy and of plagues and of their signs.
We have already said in the first chapter that in all diseases in which catarrh of the mucus is convenient and useful, and medicines that combat it, and the occasions and causes of these, and the instruments necessary for their forms, have been mentioned; and we have ordered the chapters of the subordinate parts of the head to the feet.</end_of_turn>
And we will proceed in this chapter according to that method, in order that what is required may be relieved, as it has been demanded.</end_of_turn
And since we are about to begin, hear, children, that in this chapter is for terror what is in the first chapter of cautery.</end_of_turn
And for this reason, take great care, for in the operation which is in this chapter many patients have perished from excessive evacuation of the contents of the vein or incision over the abscess or opening of an ulcer or emptying of the plague or extraction of the stone or incision of the kidney. And all these things are accompanied by fear and trembling and in most of them death.</end_of_turn
I admonish you that you take no unnecessary risks, for some veined patients have perished from your methods.</end_of_turn And it is better for you that you depart from your disease and are lighter than to bring death upon your patients, and to increase the length of their disease, and for the fear which signifies death.</end_of_turn
And this is what I give you to know and tell you, that you hope for that health, and your disease is treacherous.</end_of_turn
Therefore do not consent to any of those things from which this practice is composed; and your caution should be greater than your desire and your boldness; and do not presume any cause except for that which you certainly know to be useful, and from which you can expect a blessed success.</end_of_turn
Use in the care of all patients the prognosis and indication of which is converted to health, for in that is your aid in acquiring fame and memory, of the benefactor and of glory.</end_of_turn
Oh, children, God in you inspires understanding and does not command you to go against his direction and protection, for he is in your hand.</end_of_turn
And I have ordered this chapter to be distinguished by chapters according to the order of the chapter of cautery, from the care of the head to the feet, in order that what is required of you from this and from which you have need be alleviated.</end>
First Chapter.</end_of_turn>
Of the care of the water which is contained in the head of children.</end_of_turn
You know that this disease is not found in adults, but in children when the yolk of the egg is still in their head.
And many times the cause of this is hidden, which is not known.</end_of_turn>
I have not seen this disease in adults; and in all those whom I have seen it has carried death along with it, and for this reason I have given up on it.</end_of_turn
And I have seen that a child whose head was filled with water, his head was always so large that he could not rest his head upon his chest, and that even when he was lifted up he could not rest his head for the greatness of his head, and that in addition the moisture increased so that there was death.</end_of_turn
And this moisture is either thickened between the cartilage and the bone, or is thickened outside the bones over the brain.</end_of_turn
When the operation is undertaken when the moisture is between the navel and the hip bone, and the afterbirth is scanty, it is necessary to make a cut in the middle of the thigh with a fissure two finger-widths wide, so that the moisture may escape.
And if the moisture is more abundant and the afterbirth is greater, two incisions are made according to this method:
If the moisture remains in the bones, this is an indication that the head of the bone has been fractured from the root and the water is squeezed out when you compress that area with your thumb against the surrounding parts, and it is not blood that you see. Therefore, three incisions are made in the middle of the thigh according to this method:
And so extract all the moisture; then strengthen the incisions with strips and cushions; and give him wine and oil to drink every day, and remove the ligatures and cure the wound with attempts and ointments, and strengthen the thigh equally; and feed the patient with dry food of little moisture until the limb is comfortable and healed.</end_of_turn>
There is another method of incision which considers the size of the afterbirth and the collection of water, since some veins are more prominent in the occipital region, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore attend to the incision where the afterbirth appears and the water collects, and make the incision as wide as possible.</end_of_turn>
Note that you must not pierce the artery, and be careful that the blood does not clot; keep the patient calm for the evacuation of moisture.</end_of_turn>
End of Document
When there are clots or abscesses on the heels or toes, and the swelling has subsided, and you do not trust in the cure of the medicines, the best cure in this case is the incision of those two arteries.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when you wish to make the incision of those, the patient must keep his head still, and press firmly on the area around the bone with rough hands to expose the arteries, and strengthen the patient's chest with some support; and consider where the vein is located; and do not go over the places where some of the veins which are close to the ankles are depressed, and so on until you reach the bone.</end_of_turn
And so on with the other arteries, make an incision at the apex of each segment of bone which is acutely painful at the incision, and as wide as the head of the thigh.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, after you have made the incision, close the artery and join the incisions to the surrounding parts.</end_of_turn
And the length of the incision should be two fingers wide, because when any vein is incised, blood is ejected with a pulsating flow, which jumps out frequently.</end_of_turn
Even if the artery does not appear at the incision, it is necessary to measure the circumference of the ankle three fingers wide, and do so cautiously, and make the incision into the bone.</end_of_turn
And as for the amount of wine to get from the blood, it is approximately one cup.</end_of_turn And take no more or less than this, according to the quantity of the virtue of the patient and the replacement of the artery.</end_of_turn
And consider the wound, and therefore if there remains any cause of swelling on the bone, the incision must be made to prevent further clotting.</end_of_turn
And strengthen the wound with cushions and silk threads, and cure that which is inflamed until it is healed.</end_of_turn
End of Document
Concerning the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
When there are ancient accidents of embolism or acute wounds which are aggravated by agricultural humidity or by the quality of the lacerations of the temples, or even ancient fevers which resemble these, and when these cannot be treated by the methods of medical care, we must resort to the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or the cauterization of these veins as we have shown.</end_of_turn
The method of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient should lie down on the side for which they are in the temples; and understand that the artery which appears in the temple is the one which you have shown by your finger, and that it is hidden only in a few people because of its violence.</end_of_turn
If the cause of the disease is hidden, the doctor should suspect a strong dose of madness in the patient; and immediately let the patient's tongue swell with a rough or bitter substance or evaporate the tongue with lukewarm water until the madness subsides. Then take the patient's tongue, which is the sign of this disease.</end_of_turn> And immediately uncover the belly and extract that which is above to the navel and extract that from the flanks until you have extracted that from the belly and discovered that which is under the tunic which you have left behind, from every part.</end_of_turn>
Maybe if the artery is subtle, wrap that around the nail, and immediately cut a piece according to the quantity by which the limbs are swollen, and do not touch the blood, for if they are not cut they will not be cured of anything.</end_of_turn>
And immediately evacuate blood from the vein somewhat.</end_of_turn Until three times.</end_of_turn>
And if the wound is great, the doctor should cover that with two layers of cheese or silk thread, and do not leave it exposed until the decay has subsided and the wound has consolidated.
And immediately remove the excess which is between two bones; do that at that hour or at another time.</end_of_turn>
Or if you wish, cauterize that which is pointed at the bone which is pointed at the nail until the limbs are swollen, and leave the work in its place.</end_of_turn
And it is better for the disease if the patient has a fever or is of scaly complexion; because the cautery is of those causes which help to dry out humors, and therefore is better in summer.</end_of_turn
And cover immediately the extraction of the arteries which you saw on the ankle, and keep it covered with fine powder, and immediately apply either cure with dry medicines which cause the flesh to dry out or with poultices until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if while you are working you see that blood is flowing from the wound, then immediately stop that bleeding, either by cautery or by tying off the artery, or by packing the wound, and hold your hand over the wound until the bleeding has stopped.</end_of_turn And if none of these causes are present, the doctor should wait until the wound is consolidated, and then apply lukewarm water to the wound until the pain subsides, and be strong as before.</end_of_turn
And what is more curious in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein at this point having two clips, because you have marked the two points at the attempt, and you have left out the parts in between, until you reach the bone and split the vein in two places, so that it is elongated what is between the limbs, which are not consolidated at all by this cautery.</end_of_turn
This is the way of cautery:</start_of_turn>
And the acute of the two clips is perfect.</start_of_turn Better yet if the acute is less than two clips, because if the acute is too great it will burn the flesh too quickly.</start_of_turn
Therefore when there is any thickness, keep the fire of the flame in those and the flesh is split with delight.</start_of_turn
This work is better in all work and is lighter.</start_of_turn
And the space between two clips is the quantity of the thickness of the finger.</start_of_turn

Of the care of the limbs of the acute and sour humors of the bones.
When the sour humors are like that, and the veins which are over the head of the femur are compressed, and do not comfort in any way the treatment of medicine, and sometimes the face of the patient already shows signs of decay and sits in front of walking like a swarm of ants, and the bones of that limb are extended, hummed out more than they were known to be, and the skin is scaled over by the acute of the tears, the old methods of treatment in this operation are useless, and one must apply this treatment with space.</start_of_turn
And you command the patient to stretch out the limbs which are in front, and immediately make three incisions equally distant according to the length of the face.</start_of_turn If the length of the wound falls two fingers: one wound be equally distant from the length of the nose at the middle of the face, and the second according to the length of the movement of the tears which are in the lacrimal, and the third from the other side.
And guard your hand from the start of the arteries which are in two lines, and extend your hand from the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space of any incision is such that the quantity of three fingers can be adjusted.
And if you have a sponge dressed or dry cloth moist with which you will dry the wound
Then interlace the sponge of two sharp extremities, of which this is the shape of the incision of them: that is from the part of the temples to the second incision Excise all that whole cord that is between two incisions on the lip that is over the bone, and then make that which is over the bone move into the second incision And then stretch this sponge and enter through the first incision another instrument which is called cautery, sharp from one side and blunt from the other.
And stop the bleeding of that sharp from over the vein that is beside the cord, and the bleeding from the bone that does not reach the os, and fill that up until it reaches the middle of the wound, and close with that all the blood vessels that go from the head to the heels.
May be the incision is continued up to the cord, and then make that which is in the middle of the wound enter into the other incision
And when the wound has healed as much as possible, press the parts of the wound together with a bandage
And pause in any wide wound for an old coat, and pause over those dusts covered in wine and oil and vinegar, and anything that does not cause pus to come out of the cautery.
And on the third day remove the ligament and give great abundance of lukewarm water or tepid, and take care that there is no oil or vinegar remaining, and other things that may cause the wounds to become inflamed.
End of book.
From the care of the eyes for the care of the limbs descend from the parts that are distant from the head.
When at some time some acute catarrh and continuing, and sometimes the limbs of the patient extend slightly, and already regarding them it is necessary to take care, and the ulcerated palpebras and their sockets are for this reason, and in the front of the head there is sharp pain and subsequent vomiting, for these accidents that the matters and catarrh do not go out but from blood vessels from the distant parts proceed
And the best cure for these is this: that the patient should chew less aggressively, and then make an incision in the middle of the face, a little for the width (and begin with the incision of the left temporal until the right temporal; and let the incision be over the bone; and extend your hand from the tears of the temples which are bitten by the chewing), until the bone is exposed
Excise all the wound with sponge or dry cloth and then replace between the two lips of the wound with an old coat or cloth of lint And then stretch out the dust covered in wine and oil for so that it does not cause pus to come out of the cautery
When you have removed that and you see that the abscess has already diminished, then take care that the bones are cold until they begin to naturally regain their flesh, and take care of that which regulates the excessive discharge that makes the flesh wane, like if you take two barley grains and four coriander seeds and mix them together, or like if you make plaster of them and administer it to these wounds that have lost their flesh

About the care of that which comes out in the armpits.
Every cause that comes out in the armpits is of four kinds, that is, either a mineral stone or something resembling a stone, like iron and lead, or of plants like celery or beans, or a fluid cause like vinegar and wine and their like, or any beast
And therefore when stone comes out in the armpit or any other cause that does not adjust or grow in the armpit, and stops the armpit in the sunlight, and if sometimes the stone, then distil in that any cause of olive oil or vinegar, and then administer the extraction of it, and make it vomit with condiment, and apply compresses to the area where the vomiting occurred And immediately stop the circulation of the ankle by pressing some pieces of lead or wool against it, and extend the ankle outwards, because the veins become swollen from these causes.
If it is not swollen, then give extraction with the instrument called epicaricary sponge, which is like this:
If it is swollen with the sponge, do not do anything; but if not, then give extraction with a little incision of little duplication.
Therefore, if it is not swollen by this, then make a needle of gut and enter the extremity of the needle into the cavity of the ankle and close around the needle with wax and with plenty of ointment so that only the needle comes out. And immediately extract from the belly with strong traction, because the veins become swollen as we have recounted
Maybe if it is not swollen in this way, then take a burning brand or a cold compress and apply it to the part where the pain is, and keep it there for a sufficient time. And immediately put it into the cavity of the ankle with ease, and immediately dry the ankle from the moisture.
Therefore, if it is not swollen by all the causes that we have recounted, then you should order that the patient be cauterized or given an antispasmodic drug
And the way to cauterize that is to first heal the phlebitis of the vein and then extract according to the virtue of the instrument, and then make a small incision in the heel of the ankle and drain the black bile from the area before the area is cauterized. And the incision should reach as far as the heel bone, and when the bone is exposed, remove the cause of the pain with suitable instruments; and immediately close the incision with speed, and care for it until it is healed
And if the cause of the pain in the ankle is one of the fatty substances that grows and inflates, give treatment and extraction; even if you do not obey my words immediately, I order you to take a little space in this way: And give with that the excision of the fat that is causing the pain in the ankle
And do not be surprised when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ankle, and keep it still in pieces, and immediately extract from the nails or with the sponge, or by incision as I have said, because the extraction is alleviated
But in the water in which the ankle is immersed, which should use for sternutation at the beginning, fill the ankle with some old rags, and hold over that ankle the part of the water which is causing the pain, and if it is swollen by this, do not do anything; but if not, take hold of the patient’s foot and ankle with your hands, and put on a pair of gloves, and with your hands break the bones in the ankle in one place and in the other place hit the ankle bone against the bone that is causing the pain. Therefore do not stop until all the water is swollen.
Therefore do not stop until all the water is swollen. and if the water is still swollen even then, take paper or gut and put one extremity in the ankle and extend the other extremity with fire until the most of the pain is gone.
And put on another glove and keep the water so swollen until all the water is swollen, and then take out the bone that is causing the pain with a needle as it is called the extracting bone
However, in the extraction of beasts that are within that ankle, if it is small in size, push and hold it still, care for it as we have said in the division; but if it is of great size which causes a wound immediately, then give extraction with instrument and nails, and the cause of the pain is less severe than all the other causes that cause pain in the ankle.
However, in the extraction of worms engendered in the ankle, when you have cured that which we have said in the division and in the treatise of distillations, and you do not neglect your treatment, I order that you keep the ankle in the sun.
Therefore, if there appears here any cause of the worms, then give extraction with instrument or nails, but if no cause appears, take a needle and grasp the gut from the side and open it like this The limb is introduced into the heel according to the quantity of suffering; then quickly withdraw and do so cautiously, making movements as slight as possible, until all the worms are expelled.
Even if you do not obey my order, the hour has passed and closed in the circle of the needle as we have said; the hour to administer the distillations which have already been excreted in the treatment of the worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations.</end_of_turn>
And let your effusion be with the oil of medicines in the heel with this instrument of which this is the form:...</end_turn> And make that of silver or of lead, leave it straight, in which there is a small hole, and put a pin through it.</start_turn>
And thus it is like when it is necessary to make an incision in the curvature of the continental canula here.</start_turn And if you wish, take the ray and wrap it around the foot downwards properly, and then pour oil into the cavity of the limb, or juice of any herb, or whatever you wish of these medicines in the canula – and that is in the heel – and then introduce the ray around the foot downwards and press with your hand that which is over the compression of the limb until the oil is expelled from the cavity of the limb and the patient feels the oil adhering to the limb.</start_turn
And that which is infiltrated in the heel is already scorched with fire a little.</start_turn And keep this in mind that the cause for which you distill in the heel should not be too cold, because the medicines of the heel do not suffer from that.</start_turn
Chapter VII.</start_turn>
On the treatment of the opia of the heels.</start_turn
Some veins of young children are sometimes seen swollen from the bites of large worms that do not pierce the skin; and this opiate in the meat of the heel for plague or for nothing in that; and this opiate is useful in the groin of the heel which does not always happen, and some are in the outer parts.</start_turn
And that which occurs in the groin of the limb, which does not always happen, is in the greatest difficulties of recovery.</start_turn
And in that in which you can make it happen, cover that you keep the heel of the patient towards the sun and rest in that.</start_turn And thus if sometimes there is apparent opia, open that with the pointed cautery of which this is the form:
If the limb in which it is small in latitude, of which one side is acute and the other is not; and the sponge is of two blunt lions so that it does not damage the heel.</start_turn
And thus if the opia is for a wound born in the heel or in the meat of the limb, then take that which is blunt and cut that with great facility until all the wound is gone.</start_turn
And if the opia is in the groin of the heel, then take a blunt needle and burn that with a little fire, and then put that on the meat of the heel.</start_turn
And thus if you smell opia in that which the patient finds with ease, for the gravity of the elevation, try to reduce the pressure of the limb with ease; and keep this in mind that you do not damage the nerves of the heel.</start_turn
And thus keep the heel wrapped around the ankle according to the quantity of the breadth of the incision which you have enclosed in Egyptian unguent; and do that for several days until you are sure of the consolidation of the wound; or that you take something and press that into the wound and sprinkle over it powdered alum and use of it; and if sometimes the heel is already blistered, then cover that which you take out and change that for another which you wrap in cerate that is useful with olive oil, until the wound is bled dry; and take care of that until it is healed.</start_turn
And if there comes a flux of pus, then immerse sponge or bandage in cold water and put it on the heel, and use another care which restricts the flow of pus, which is said in the treatise on distillations.</start_turn
Chapter VIII.</start_turn
On the care of the athezil which is indebted to the eyelids.</start_turn
The athezils which are indebted to the eyelashes of the eyes are some humid, and some dry.</start_turn
Therefore cover that you have those above your toes or on your ankles, and cut those above the base of your toes, and then pause over the areas that are sweating.
May it be that if pain comes from the flux of blood, then you cauterize those that are blunt lancelets underneath.
And the better cautery is when the veins and blood vessels return when the cause of those matters has disappeared; and when they are cauterized with fire, those matters are consumed and do not return.

Great pain that comes to the eyelids of the heels.
Veins that are full in the eyelids of the heels cause any cause that is similar to great pain in its strength and hardness, and for this reason it is called great pain.
And it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the lower eyelid and its detachment
Therefore the operation for them is that you consider if the pain is due to them from the eyelid and is widespread throughout; and the cause of it is light
Therefore cut across that limb at the breadth, and then drain that throughout easily so that it escapes, and then suspend that which is on top and cut away that
And if the figure is great, the hour you adjust with suture; and care for that until it is healed
And if it is little, do not do too much harm for that which remains of it restores that and nourishes it.
And if the pain is declining at the edges of the eyelid, you must shave the surface of the eye, the hour you remove the eye and suspend the pain that is on top, so that you do not see it again from the incision, and cut away that throughout, and if the eyelid is elongated by the incision, the pain will not be noticed in any cause
And then close the incision, wash the wound with salt water; and care for the area until it is healed
End of treatise
Of the care of the detached eyelid from the heel
Ascirna is gray matter that is generated in the tunics of the detached eyelid, and especially in children, aggravates the heels of those who suffer from it, and prevents them from seeing the sun because the tears are mixed with them.
And so they sometimes wipe their faces all the time, and over their faces they sleep; and over their eyelids they put wet eyelashes, which already cover the inflammation, and the apparent imminence of pain is in the heel; and when you press on the area that you say, you find pain inside those
And any way of operating is in that one in which the patient keeps his head still in the belly, and then you put a bandage on it and make a circle according to the amount that contains all the afterbirth, and then you remove that above that and cut through those that you say throughout so that it is added to the afterbirth in the middle of the circle, and then you make in the middle of that humidity that is incident upon the fissure at the breadth, and the fissure is not greater than the fissure that is made in a flabby body
May it be that in the preparation cover that you cut through the whole cord until you reach the afterbirth, because in the most part of the processes of afterbirth through a fissure according to the form of white grease.
Therefore extract that which you wrap with cloths that you put between the thighs that you say at the edges and twist between the right and left hand until it is gone
And keep in mind that you do not make an adjustment in the fissure for so that the humidity does not reach the heel and remove that.
May it be that if it does not appear to you in the beginning of the fissure, may you adjust in the fissure a little thing that facilitates the afterbirth; and then extract that which we have said; and then cover with cloths and vinegar and pause over the area and remove those that are like dust
And so when they break salt and stop that in the concavity of the fissure so that what remains of that humidity.
And care for that until it is healed
If the burn happens on the sole of the foot, the treatment is to plaster the burn until it heals.
When the burn occurs on the sole of the foot, the treatment is to plaster the burn until it heals.</start_of_turn>
In the way of the handling of the wound.</start_of_turn
When the veins of the eyes dilate due to excessive heat or other causes, the eyes become dry and the vision becomes blurred, causing excessive tears and swelling of the eyelids. This is when the humors become thick and sticky, causing pain and inflammation of the eye. Treatment for this consists of cautery, acute medicine as described previously, excision with suture or cannas according to the physician's judgment.</start_of_turn
Therefore, you must hold the patient's head still; convert the eye of the patient with your left hand, and if it is converted, well and good; otherwise, insert a needle in the area where there is most sensitivity of the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate deep enough, and when it has penetrated as far as the margin of the eyelid where the veins lie, then push the needle towards the inside of the eyelid, and convert the eye again.</start_of_turn
Therefore, remove from the margin of the eyelid towards the outside the greater lacrymal vein with the greater lacrymal duct; then extract the needle and leave the eyelid covered with small pieces of lint or gauze, and put over the eye a compress like the figure of a laurel leaf.</start_of_turn
However, it must be known that the figure must be such as to correspond to the degree of elevation of the eyelid, because this varies among people, and some people require that the large vein of the eye be more widely opened according to the degree to which the eye is swollen.</start_of_turn
Therefore, place the compress over the two lines that you marked, starting from the greater lacrymal vein towards the smaller lacrymal vein.</start_of_turn And if the wound is extensive towards the veins naturally, like the greatness of a king.</start_of_turn
And place the sponge in one of the two angles of the wound, and then remove the whole, and with the thumb adjust the two lips towards the gum or thread, and grasp the hernia, and remove the excess from around the nails with various means, as you wish, or do not cure.</start_of_turn
And repeat the suture of the nails every three days or four, and then cure the wound.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, leave the dressing untied and suture, and cure the wound as it dries and contracts, because the eye is relieved of the pain of the wound and the swelling; in this way the suture is better. Therefore I recommend that you do not remove the old stitches.</start_of_turn
However, in this case there is great solicitude for the patient, and it is a good operation, and do not be afraid.</start_of_turn
And another way of treating is to mark on the eye the figure like a laurel leaf, and then lift the eye with three nails secured together in this way.</start_of_turn
If this is not possible, take nails and make holes in the figure, and put one needle in the middle of the mark and the other towards the greater lacrymal vein, and the other towards the smaller lacrymal vein, and adjust between the nails with equal measure, and with the hand that is holding the eye elevated to the same height as the mark.</start_of_turn
And adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and cure when it is healed.</start_of_turn
If the burn happens on the sole of the foot, leave the burn covered with a compress and hold it still, and do not move it.</start_of_turn
All these herbs that are on the eye that cause them to swell, because of the heat or other causes, must be converted by means of the methods that we have mentioned; in this case, suture is not necessary.</start_of_turn
The treatment with cannas is as follows:</start_of_turn And you convert the eye and split the figure as I have recounted; and then make two cannas or two fine needles whose length is according to the length of the eye and the width of the wound is less than the width of the compress.</start_of_turn You have already opened at the extremities of each part, where you have the threads.</start_of_turn

De la cura de ehacratir la qual ve en la palpebra desus.
Quan ve en le huel ehacratir, e es contraccio de la palpebra quan es contrayta en sus, o a dextra o a sinistra partida, per mala consolidacio de plagua o de seccio o de cauteri, e es apelada leporina, e aquesta ahercrati o es natural o accidental, e es fayta per consolidacio de plagua o de seccios o de cauteri, o per semblantz a lor malcuratz.
May the manner of the operation in you be that you cut through that consolidation and separate the lips of you, and leave it in that which is between those two a little of ointment of lead, and ligate those until they are healed.
And do not neglect to care for the cause of this, restriction; for if you leave it as it is, it will become worse at any time rather than better
Use in that case that softens like fennel, and embroil with the water in which they are cooked to a high temperature and seeds of lead, or ointment of iodine, which is liquefied with some oil, and immerse in that the wound, and care for that.</start_of_turn>
And the treasure of your care is that you perforate at all times that it is not consolidated according to the form in which it began.</start_of_turn>
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing other than a rectification of the swelling that does not restore the shape of the limb as it was before.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIV.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of swelling that is beneficial in the palm of the hand.</start_of_turn
This swelling that is beneficial in the palm of the hand, which is truly called swelling; and it is of two kinds, one natural, the other accidental.</start_of_turn
The accidental one is beneficial for wound or cut or burn or other similar things.</start_of_turn
And the way of the operation of this is that you take a needle in which you make double thread, and leave that in the flesh, and that you pass the thread from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal, until the thread reaches the two extremities of the flesh.</start_of_turn
And then stretch the flesh around the needle and hold that with the needle, and pierce with the needle at a wide space.</start_of_turn And therefore if you return the figure of the palm to its former state, it is not good; and if so, take the thread again and leave that in the indented figure, and over that convert the palm, and close the two incisions in the side of the palm of the hand.</start_of_turn
And the extremities of the two incisions make two angles of the incision, which have benefited within that they converge, and be of their benefit angle within that when they reunite be of benefit figure of them.</start_of_turn
And this figure is the Greek letter: lambda.</start_of_turn
And then hold the flesh that is around that quantity of the palm of the hand, so that the palm does not swell.</start_of_turn
And then adjust the separated parts and bind those with the thread of silk; and then care for those as we have said of the soothing medicines and the ointments that must be put on that it may heal.</start_of_turn
And if the swelling has to be for wound or suture or burn, the hour covers that you make a flat incision over the area of the palm as it is said before.</start_of_turn And then separate the skin between two lips as we have said.</start_of_turn
In the sum of the speech of the care of swelling when it is detached or of the palm, that runs in the operation, according as it is prepared in the form of swelling, and that is in the form of various masses.</start_of_turn
And the wise surgeons always prepare any means possible for them to restore the figure to its natural shape, or rather from that, and that disease according to what is convenient for the operation and the instruments that are at their disposal.</start_of_turn
Chapter XV.</start_of_turn
Of the adhesion of the palm to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.</start_of_turn
When this adhesion occurs to several people at once that it is solidified the palm more than usually with the album of the hair, and that it is prohibited from the facility of movement and its natural works, therefore you must remove the limb of the hand from the palm, and elevate it above that, or extend that with the nail.</start_of_turn
And then you pierce the adhesion with a blunt needle, which is not at the acuity of the incisions, having made an obtuse point so that the disease is not disturbed by the operation, and remain the piece that does not cause the hair to fall out from its acuity.</start_of_turn
And be your incision such as to gently remove that adhesion until the palm is returned to its natural shape and that the adhesion is completely healed.</start_of_turn
E aprop tu met en le huel aygua salada am la qual tu laves; o distilla en lu de zunia dissolvut in l’aygua.
Then separate between the eyelid and the nail with forceps of lead, and place over the eye a bandage soaked in vinegar infused with oil, and on the third day use astringents until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVI.</end_of_turn>
Of the beginning of the nail and the swelling of the tear ducts.</end_of_turn
Wisely that the nail is of two kinds, that is, either nervous or insensitive. The nervous is like a hard, smooth cylinder; or it is insensitive, resembling white solidified moisture, which when one touches it, or is forced to take it with a nail, is torn away and the nail does not adhere to it.</end_of_turn
And both of these species do not commence until from the greater lacrimal which goes gradually covering the eye and hinders the light and the movement of the eye.</end_of_turn
The way of working in the beginning of the nail is that the patient should sit up in bed, and touch their toes with their hands, and elevate the eyelid with your hand, and collect the nail with a nail of little duplication and stretch it out to the parts below.</end_of_turn And take a needle and enter into that a piece of hair of horse or of calf or of ox, or something like that, or thread, or a strong thread, or duplicate the extremity of the needle gradually and leave that in the middle of the nail, and pierce through that with the needle, and tie with thread the nail; and stretch that out to the parts below, and scrape with the skin the side of the nail which touches the pupil.</end_of_turn And thus keep that within the skin behind it.</end_of_turn
And thus keep the incision near the root of the lacrimal with a soft sponge or with small forceps, and release the natural secretion of the lacrimal so that from the incision there does not flow continuous tears.</end_of_turn
And if necessary, cover the nail with the sun nail extended or with thread, as we have said, and approach it with a sponge of the kind mentioned above.</end_of_turn
Beware that on the sponge do not touch the corneal membrane and that you avoid breaking it, and that the pupil is perforated.</end_of_turn>
Then pour a little salt or snuff of sulfur into the bath and leave it like that until the next day; and take care of that which covers until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the nail is insensitive and cannot be pierced with the needle, or is not fixed in that nail, in that case this kind of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed just as well as recommended in the division.</end_of_turn
And if you wish to perform an incision, then you must touch the limb of the patient and take a soft sponge of fine freul with acute friction according to this manner:</end_of_turn with smoothness.</end_of_turn> And if sometimes it is rare and is confused and sticks to that root, then do distill from your urine in the head of the patient by means of snuff or by means of vinegar or by means of salt trissated, and bathe the limb within the next day.</end>
And approach again that operation until everything that is of it is removed, except that the contrary scab remains on the limb, for you must read that, and care for the beginning of the scab until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And repeat your operation on that reason until it is healed.</end_of_turn
The swelling of the tear duct, if you notice it in the limb during the night, is suspended with a nail; and pierce that part of it, and do not finish the incision so that no tears flow from it.</end_of_turn
And pour vinegar in the tear duct of the head and make snuff until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XVII.</end_of_turn
Of the incision of the armpit and of what is born of a limb adjusted in the limb.</end_of_turn
Some veins in the arms of the armpit are born with a rough skin, and are more than enough to cover the pupil, or approach or stretch over the eyelids and tightly compress the eyelids against the parts below and are fixed like a barrier.</end_of_turn
May the operation be that the patient suspends his head in the belly; and immediately open the heel of that and collect all the cartilage that is convenient at that time with forceps or with a vessel; and when that is done, break the cartilage little by little until everything is finished with the incision. Take care that you do not injure anything during the operation.
And as for the incision, do it at the place where we have recommended it at the nail, or with small forceps as are collected together according to the form of the thing in this chapter.
Therefore, when the incision is finished and the cartilage is collected, immediately pour salt over the wound, or sprinkle in the dust of burned alum, like the corrosive medicines, and rest your hand over the wound until it is confirmed that the bleeding has stopped
If there remains any cause of anxiety and the wound is not safe without cautery, and there is fear of further bleeding, then read the wound and care for the bleeding with water until it stops. Then repeat over that part that was operated on until it is healed, and in the meantime keep the wound adjusted as it happened in this case.
May it be known that we must not perform any other cure for the wound except by natural means or by chance, with a needle, and do not put your hand on any of these operations until you see that that limb is suffering from that operation.
Chapter XVIII.</start_of_turn>
Of the collection of cartilage in the wound.</start_of_turn>
Cartilage is seen to be tough over the wound and forbids the dressing from being placed. It must remain on the wound for several days.</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the cartilage in which the wound is tough and is not another disease of cartilage, then collect that cartilage.</start_of_turn
And command the patient to suspend his head in the belly, and immediately suspend those veins with one or two nails according to your prudence; and that nail be of doubled substance according to this form:
or so two nails gradually in a circle according to this form:</start_of_turn
Then gather those veins with fine forceps, with skill, and remove the silk hour by hour until all those veins are finally closed and withdrawn.</start_of_turn
Take care that you do not injure the edges of the wound. And if during the operation you see the sun, and if you are firm in your operation, do not insert anything except those veins.</start_of_turn
And when you have completed it, then you pour in the wound cold water or vinegar so that its acidity corrodes what is remaining of the cartilage.</start_of_turn
May it not be to your ability to collect all that time, and if you do not, then you plaster all with water that comes out of the wound, and read the wound for several days until the pain is gone and the bleeding is stopped.</start_of_turn
And repeat over it as many times as the maid manages until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And this is the form of the forceps:</start_of_turn
Chapter XIX.</start_of_turn
Of the reduction of arizati to the nose.</start_of_turn
When you have cured the arizati with cautery or acute medicine, if it is not healed according to the narration, do not be afraid of it, but make an incision over the maturity of the wound, and extract all the moisture that is in it until the bone is exposed.</start_of_turn
And when the bone is exposed and sometimes in its corruption or blackness, then you scratch it with a tool of this kind:</start_of_turn
And it is called a rough cap, and make it with a knife, and round off the head as if you were making a point with a needle or with lime for a point (as it is in the following form).</start_of_turn
And rest it over the corrupt part of the bone, and gradually rotate that between the thighs mentioned, and press your hand little by little until you see that that corruption is gone.</start_of_turn
And if there is any blood, and when the wound has recovered, restore the limb with desiccant and astringent substances.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if the limb is consolidated and the new cartilage has been born, and if the limb has been separated from the belly for forty days, and it is not renewed and is not swollen and no accident has happened in it, then you know that it is healed.</start_of_turn
If not, then it is not in their engineering but in reducing the fissure to the shape of a nose, and in this manner: that you uncover the bones following the fashion of a sharp knife or acute medicine, and as if you had uncovered the bones, then you take three stripes according to this fashion:
Then the three stripes are of the triangular form, and the head of the bone is first extended into the limb as sometimes happens with them.
And then rest that over the bone, and that from the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little further, and then draw your hand over the stripes until you have penetrated all the bones, and he will feel the pain as though he had found wind to loosen it when you remove your hand.
Therefore restore the limb with astringent medicines by drying them out in this way as if you had taken them away
When the flesh and the limb are hardened, then the matter which was exuding to the parts returns to the nose, therefore it is more curious about the pain.

When the limb swells completely and does not yield in the night or diminish, then it is necessary to loosen the pain, and immediately take away the cause of the pain; and also stop any breezes from the neck downwards. Place on the limb a liniment which is made of acacia and aloe and beeswax and gum Arabic, and strengthen the dressing over the limb with powder.
And the manner of the powder is that you take lion's mane cloth and each fold is doubled four times; and make of those folds.
And rest those over each other according to the quantity of which the limb has need. And strengthen over those with a firm and strong structure; and repeat the breezes with care, and keep the limb still during the day and night.
Even if the ligament is softened, it is necessary that it be kept straight
And keep the ligament still both day and night as we have said
And if sometimes the limb has already shrunk, that is good, and if not, then repeat the dressing with the powder and the structure and the breezes until it is healed

When there is disruption in the outer tunic of the eye, and it is eminent and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grain of sand, and is of the shape of a man, and you wish to pierce it, then the operation in this case is as follows: enter the needle at the root of the eyebrow from the outside of the eye towards the inside, and then put the needle back in the place where the double fold is, and make that penetrate and take out the first needle according to its position; and then pierce the limb of the double fold and bring with it the part of the eyebrow which is around the needle, and strengthen that hold

And if it is not prepared for the descent of the wound with water as we have said, then make the pain lie between your thumbs and take a pointed cautery and burn over that part of the eyeball where the conjunctiva meets the cornea at the crown (in the place where the old wound was), until the wound is expelled.</end_of_turn
Therefore when it is outside of the ordinary, you distill into the cold water a mixture of honey or water in which you have boiled rue and honey.
And thus treat with the other causes until it is healed.

Of the care of water descends from the scent.</end_of_turn>
We have already said concerning the species of water in the division and what is to be performed, that is to declare according to the state of health.</end_of_turn
Therefore keep the patient between your hands over the heel of his foot and hold his hand firmly.</end_of_turn
And thus place your left hand over the heel of the foot if the water is cold, or your right hand if it is hot.</end_of_turn
And thus take hold of the mixture with your right hand if it is cold, or with your left hand if it is hot.</end_of_turn
And thus withdraw the extremity of the mixture near the margin of the eye for the thickness of the hair on the brow, and mix the mixture with oil and stir with your hand.</end_of_turn
And thus penetrate into the eye and sit down so that the mixture has already reached its purpose by reason of its heat.</end_of_turn
Therefore measure the length of the mixture up to the pupil, which is the margin of the eye; and this is the circumference of the eye. See that this is visible through the pupil with the vision of the eye for the clarity of the cornea.</end_of_turn
And thus withdraw the mixture into the place where the water is, and then draw up a little more from below, so that if the water has descended too much, the patient will see better when he looks at the object which was causing his vision to be blurred, and the mixture in the eye.</end_of_turn
And thus rest for a little while; so if the water has descended, withdraw that other little bit so that there is no excess of mixture left in the eye.</end_of_turn
And thus when it is quiet and does not descend, withdraw the mixture easily and gently, and mix with your hand a little of clear salt of gemma and rub in that way; and then wash the eye with lukewarm water, and wipe away any mucus with a cloth or bandage infused with oil of roses and vinegar, and mix with the water the remnants of the mixture.</end_of_turn
May God keep us from those who are of our time and let us rest over that which is nourishing to the eye.</end_of_turn
And if you do not obey your eye with the mixture during its application — for some men whose eyes are naturally hard are like this — then know that you must take the sponge which is called the alberid and which is the form of this:
Therefore pierce at that conjunctiva and do not touch your hand to the wound, and do not do anything else if the joint is not freed from the mixture.</end_of_turn
And thus apply the mixture as we have said.</end_of_turn
And you must praise God for your work, whether he prepared the patient for the disease by descending in the place where he sleeps in a dark room, and prohibited from all movement.</end_of_turn
And rest in the nature of water so that its nature is calmed, and do not move the patient from one side to the other or from side to side at all.</end_of_turn
And keep the bandage on according to its order for the third day.</end_of_turn
And thus remove that from the dark room when the cold has passed and restore the sight, and make some inquiries, and return the bandage within seven days.</end_of_turn
And do not mix water in the hour of treatment or at any other time.</end_of_turn Know that you must keep water away from the eye so that it does not irritate it excessively and with great violence.</end>
And if the eye becomes inflamed after the cautery, know that you must remove the mixture at the end of the seventh day, and rectify with water that does not irritate.</end>
You have completed the vision of the eye and rested on the face of the patient for the reason that it is ruled by the times of the day. Leave it for a while in the dark room.</end>

Concerning the care of the flesh there is nothing new under the sun.</end_of_turn
When there are various meats born in the body, each of which is the cause of some ailment, it is like a scorpion's tail or a multitude of worms; and this disease is called polypo which is similar to that foot.</end_of_turn And it is like gangrenous flesh, ulcerated, yellow-brown; and it is like the flesh of a lion not of brown colour.</end_of_turn
Therefore, in that lion flesh there is neither fraudulence nor gangrene, cover that when you see that the patient's pain is between your hands, put him in the sun, loosen the nails and prick his belly once in those meats.</end_of_turn Then extract that to the outer parts, and indeed remove what you have understood from those by that sharp and subtle point of the thumb when you know that all the flesh is already wasted; for if there remains any cause of the disease from which the excision is possible, when you have recognized it, do so with one of the subtle instruments so that there remains no further cause.</end_of_turn Moreover, if the sovereign orders it with sanctity or acidity post-partum, when you know that there is danger; or if it is malignant post-partum, then you should cover it and cauterize that which must be excised so that it is cleanly excised and the cavities are completely healed.</end_of_turn
And indeed take in the body the vinegar or wine vinegar and water or wine.</end_of_turn Moreover, if the body is opened and there is moisture proceeding from the palate, know that it is already healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that the flesh in those wounds is nothing to the bones of the nails to which it does not reach the excision.</end_of_turn
Therefore, know that you must enter with fidelity to that to which any greatness belongs, and do not touch anything except the nails, and stay between each nail the quantity of the thumb or less, and soothe the patient and expel one part of the disease from the nails at the root or for another cause that makes it possible.</end_of_turn
And when that is done, that is to say when the stench has passed and the wound has reached the nail canals, then take away the greasy ointment that was put on, because that which is seen in the children at school in the actions of the women is a light cause of this.</end_of_turn
Then take away the two extremities of the thumb, one that goes out over the face and the other that remains in the face, and give warmth to the nails which are in the thumb, and do this until you know that the flesh is already on the nails of the thumb.</end_of_turn
Then extract the thumb, and leave in the face the stripping of the sanctity a distance of a gauze, and do this for three days or more until the bruised tissue is completely healed.</end_of_turn
And finally, when the cause is over, leave in the face a plum catheter for a few days until it is healed.</end_of_turn

But if the disease is delayed before it is magnified, however, consider if it is soft, tough, of a yellowish color and with little sensation; do not touch that which is a herpes craniorum; for spotted [disease] comes from that which is incites this herpes over that which has it.</end_of_turn

On the Eradication of Teeth.</end_of_turn>
Therefore when you cure the tooth of its pain by all means and perform the total eradication of it, there is no cause that replaces the root of it when it is eradicated, because it is a sublimated substance that is excused in the eradication of it.</end_of_turn
May it be known when the disease is forceful that this tooth must be eradicated, and you must firmly confirm that this is the painful tooth, because many roots deceive the disease and cause that there is still pain even after the operation of the barbers.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must be certified that this is the painful tooth, and that you know well, that when you make an incision around the tooth with a spatula in the area where there is any vein, until the tooth is completely separated from the gum of all parts, and then remove the part with the pliers, or with fine forceps from the beginning gradually until it is completely gone.</end_of_turn
And almost always in these forces one must hold great care for good speech or stupid fear, and suspend the head of the patient between the two painful teeth that you must not touch, and gently remove the tooth following the rule without breaking that, or without causing greater pain.</end_of_turn
Therefore if it is not forgotten, immediately take one of those instruments and put it aside from all parts with ease and strive to remove it as soon as possible so that it is done at the beginning.</end_of_turn
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you must fix that crack and strengthen that part with a fine file so that it is not broken during the constriction of that area.</end_of_turn
Therefore you must work cautiously with a scarification around the entire circumference of the gum and maintain your strength that you do not break that, and remain there until the pain is completely gone.</end_of_turn
And keep in mind that the ignorant barbers do many things that are harmful in their eagerness to eradicate teeth, without administering what we have recommended; for many roots cause greater suffering in the patients than they eliminate, or that the remaining roots remain all together, or some of them, or that they extract that which should be left in the jaw as many roots as have been testified.</end_of_turn
And after the eradication of them let the mouth be washed with wine vinegar or wine with salt.</end_of_turn
And if blood flows from the wound to help, as is often the case, then immediately wipe away any amount of blood and sprinkle powder on the wound, and if you do not confirm that powder, cauterize.</end_of_turn
The shape of the pliers and fine tweezers with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning is long extended, short handle and wide, so that they do not bend when working.</end_of_turn
And they are thus also as when the handle is large until you have practiced with them so that they are not bent, they are short extended.</end_of_turn

Extraction of teeth and loosening of the teeth roots of the lower jaw.
When you must eradicate teeth which are tormented by any cause, then cover the area around the tooth with a sponge for a day or two until the pain subsides; and then apply an ointment or plaster to the extracted teeth which are assembled like a heron's beak called ciconia or guanta, in the shape of forceps:
The extracted teeth are painful just like lime or barley
And if you do not obey me with these forceps or plaster, then cover the root and remove all the flesh and insert the instrument which is called atali, which is a small lever of this shape:
And let the large bone be extracted with a slight touch, and do not be hasty so that it is not fractured
Therefore, if the root is split, it is bad; and if not, help me with other instruments of which these are the forms: the first instrument has a triangular extraction with any thickness
The second instrument has a triangular shape and a narrower extraction
And already with this instrument having two slopes of which this is the shape again: And with other instruments which I will enumerate in the shaving of teeth; for help is given by this instrument which is assembled like a great one, and this is the shape
of the triangular extraction flat or short, which is any thickness, and do not be hasty so that it is not fractured.<end_turn>
And other precautions that the teeth must follow are like the other instruments.
May the artisans be wise and skillful in the art, for he finds for himself the means for himself according to what he understands of the operation and the various diseases; for these are the diseases for which the ancients did not say or even know of their own instruments, for the forms of various species.
May the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth be fractured or loosened, or if you should fear, be sure to cure the wound quickly over that part with the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help me with the management of which this is the shape
And be small in any size, small or large, and be bound or held in the mouth so that it does not escape or run away until the whole bone is split; and then restore the wound with appropriate medicines at your convenience
And if in the bone is little, then reduce that of that reduction and of its blackness, and care for that until it is healed

Of the care of the teeth prominent over the others
When the teeth are prominent not according to their natural course for those of the shape of a blade, and more when they tend to the ankles, and more to the beloved toes; therefore you must consider: if the tooth is nothing to another tooth, and it is not possible to shave or ligate it, then leave it alone; but if it is not annexed to another tooth, then you must use this instrument which is like a claw of a crab, and which is made of Indian iron of extracted height
And its incision must be made with the one which you have indicated for several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and that it is not like that of other teeth
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to attrition, then grind that with a file of Indian iron of this shape:
And let all be of Indian iron, the mark exactly as before; and be of such small points as needles, with which the tooth is polished little by little in several days with ease, so that it is not like another tooth that breaks. And then line it up again at the end, and reduce that at the edges of the wound
If it is from the side from which a part is torn and bleeds the tongue, then you must limit that part which you expect to be excised so that the aspired part is held back and included, and filled up so that neither the tongue bleeds nor the word is distorted.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
For the restoration of teeth made of gold or silver.
When accidents happen to the front teeth with concussion and displacement by percussion or extraction, and the patient cannot tolerate what he/she eats, and you have cured him/her with topical medications, and it has not been of any use, then it is necessary that you make gold for them, for gold does not become green and does not become poor like silver which becomes green in a few days, even though it is not changed forever
And the gold must be made in such softness and swelling according to the quantity that it must enter between the teeth; and the way to make the restoration is that you take the gold and double it between two healthy teeth, and that you make it grow between two curved surfaces of the gold between two mauled teeth, or if one or two, until the fabric reaches the healthy tooth of the other side And repeat the process until you reach the part from which you started, and hold your hand firmly and carefully until it is not bloody.
And the strip of gold that you hold must be over the roots of the teeth that you do not remove
And cut away the excess of gold with forceps or tweezers, and add those to the body, and convert them and hide them between the healthy tooth and the mauled tooth, so that it does not harm the tongue And thus let it rest as the Romans did
But if it is slipped or bulges, hold that or those to the other gold in such a way that it will always be firm
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the restoration of two healthy teeth and two mauled teeth, like these which are linked:
And when you return a tooth or two back to their place, close the wounds at the same time, and let them recede as we have recommended, and that they heal.
And do nothing but a good craftsman and a wise man
And many herbs are suitable for any cause of the bones of cows, and it is useful for them as teeth, and is placed in the place where the tooth is defective, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.

Of the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speaking
This ligament which is found behind the tongue has some herbs or is natural from which people do not know, or it is accidental and is caused by a wound which has already consolidated
And the operation in it is that you burn the mouth of the patient, cut off any existing hair in the belly; and elevate the tongue, and then cut that ligament and nerves according to the width until the tongue is freed from its retraction
But if there is any hardness or discoloration, and what has happened is for the consolidation of the wound, then you must wait a little and cut that for the width until you have cut through the ligament and the discoloration has disappeared
And take care that there is no useless fissure in the heel of the limb and that you cut here and there and bring out the clot.
And finally wash away the remnants of the incision with vinegar or wine or with wet gauze; and then leave the tongue free; so is the one which has the patient leave the tongue in any night so that it is not consolidated by another herb.
But if there is flux of blood, leave over the wounded part for a while; but if the blood boils, then cauterize the place with a pointed cautery which you should keep moist with water And thus care for the other causes until it is healed.
Chapter XXXV
Of the extraction of a ranula from the tongue
Some external factors cause the tongue to swell, resembling a small nail, prohibiting its natural operation; and this greatly increases until the mouth is empty.
The operation for this is that you open the patient's mouth and expose the swelling before the sun, and consider the swelling
If you see any black or dark spots, rough to the touch, which the patient does not feel, do not touch that which is cranky
If it is pale, which is humid, put on your thumb and make a small incision, and cut away all the surrounding tissue; and if you smell something during the operation, stop immediately, for it is a sign of old blood, until it is withdrawn
Then return to your work until you have completed it, until it is washed and rinsed with vinegar and salt; and care for the other care of the patient until he is healed.

Of the extraction of swelling from the two ankles and that which is in the groin and the other swellings.</start_of_turn>
When the swelling is in the groin, these are glands which are joined together and which are often soothed outwards, and are not two ankles; when you treat them with water as we have said in the division and they are not healed, then you must consider if the swelling is hard, dark in color, without feeling, for do not touch that which is painful.</start_of_turn
If it is black in color and the reason is large, do not touch that which is painful for the blood; remove that which is inside as soon as possible, or if you will break it yourself.
If it is pale, which is humid, put on your thumb and make a small incision.</start_of_turn
And the operation for this is that you consider, before you begin your operation, if the swelling has already subsided naturally or if it has diminished somewhat; and when you have opened the mouth, put the patient's head down, and open the patient's mouth, and your servant will take between their hands the patient's tongue, leaving it outside the instrument. This is the way:
It is done with silver or gold, and is subtle as a coat of paint.</start_of_turn
Therefore when you have promised that to the patient and he has shown you the swelling, and you have put your hand on that part several times, then take your thumb and stay there, and pull away everything outwards as much as you can.</start_of_turn And concerning any other cause of the swelling, and when you have made the incision with this instrument which is like this:</start_of_turn
And concerning any other cause of the swelling, and when you have made the incision with this instrument which is like this:</start_of_turn And it is assembled like forceps, however the extremities are curved, so that the orifice of each of them is in the end of the other, not pointed, which is iron that it is not blunt.</start_of_turn
Even if this instrument is not available, you can make an incision like this: and it is sharp at one end, not at the other.</start_of_turn
And having made an incision, make the other according to this manner of incision, and then hold the incision so that the patient does not suffer from excessive bleeding.</start_of_turn
And if there is bleeding, keep it moistened with decoction of poppyseed or mugwort leaves until the bleeding is stopped, and care for that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And many women suffer from swelling in the groin, other swelling in the two ankles, and these you must incision according to what we have said about the incision of two holes which touch each other.</start_of_turn

And the swelling had already become so large that there were two ramps under it when I came to take it out for two fingers.</start_of_turn
Therefore I held it tightly and put my thumb on it, and pulled out that which was big, and I put my hand over the other one, and I opened the mouth and compressed the tongue, and I held the thumb over the swelling.</start_of_turn
Then immediately evacuate a great extent, and do not delay except for a small amount of safety. Therefore it is absolutely necessary for her to urinate frequently, and begin to drink water immediately, and do not stop eating, so that I do not cease to prescribe this purgative for a long time, and afterwards will prescribe another instead of this, which will be effective as soon as the other has ceased.</end_of_turn>

More when it is cured with the water that we have said in the division, and do not grieve your cure, and immediately know that the fever has ceased when the purges have already ceased and are subtle; then know that you must prescribe something else round; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a reddish or blackish color, and is not centennial, then know that you must fear the beginning of the disease, because in that there is fear of the patient.</end_of_turn
And when you see that again according to the manner that I have said of its whiteness and length, that your patient will be cured and praise your tongue as an instrument from which to process its form and thereby remains almost in the new, and throw away that one and prescribe another two.
Know that you must not prescribe this unless it is adjusted according to the natural terms of addiction, because if you prescribe it more, you will make them sick.</end_of_turn
And at the beginning, use the water which we have recommended in the beginning of two mellas, and cure that until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
More if the disease was frightened by the beginning of the disease, know that you must use wisdom in the cauterization of it because of your fear, and the manner of the cautery is nothing but acute water, and that you hold the head of the patient over the belly, and immediately praise the tongue as the instrument which we have said, and immediately take from the water which we have mentioned in the chapter of cauterization, and comfort with that cause life, and do not allow it to be thick or subtle, and from that fill the cavity of the instrument which is the shape of this.</end_of_turn
And the emission of the cavity in which the medicine is placed just like the cavity of a ray’s shell, and stop the instrument with the medicine on the vulva, the patient will lick over his lips so that he swallows or expels saliva or mucus from his mouth for the efficacy of the medicine, so that no bad thing remains from that concerning the belly of the patient and that it escapes from that.</end_of_turn
And immediately take your hand with the medicine and press that onto the uvula for about a quarter of an hour until it is softened and calmed by the biting of the medicine.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, take a sponge and wrap that around the limb of the ray, and immerse the sponge in the medicine, and put the ray into the sponge in a cannula so that the sponge adheres to that cannula, and do that for as long as you desire until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the thumb, and then immediately remove that so that it dries and falls off on its own within three or four days.</end_of_turn
And if you do not desire that the medicine be repeated, repeat that one, and immediately after the cauterization remove the blistering in the circuit of the thumb by cutting around the edge, and modify that which is in the circuit of the medicine, and let it be washed with cold water, and let it be cured with ointment, and apply safeguards until it is healthy.</end_of_turn
And this kind of cure is more safe than the beginning and more long in fear.</end_of_turn>
Some scholars are cured of the thumb with water which is more subtle than cauterization and beginning, which is cured with subfumigation in this manner: prescribe calamine, rue, origanum, rosemary, pounded Arabic gum, chamomile, broth and similar to those herbs, and mix all these things together, or some of them, in a basin, and immerse them in vinegar; and let the vinegar be well stirred, and in the middle of the vinegar put a vessel containing a pointed instrument of iron according to this manner; let it be made of silver or iron.</end_of_turn
And let the limb be introduced into the mouth of the patient until the vapor reaches the thumb over the canula, until the thumb is not opaque.</end_of_turn
E aprop itera over those veins which are seen to be engorged until they are dry, and keep that you do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an attack of gout, for it would be too tight in the gout, and would not cover that it is necessary, but you must declare the gout of them cautiously.</li>
Even if this instrument is not present, take a tube and apply it to the outside of the limb and make a burn there, so that the mouth of the wound is covered, for the burn of the tube prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.</li

And it should be thicker than a small ray, and in the limb it should be concave in which you enter with your instrument to facilitate it.</li><end_turn
And hold his head raised above his chest, and keep that you do not touch his chest or the heel with your hand, or that the surgeon puts his hand on it.</li><end_turn
Therefore indeed that the bad air which enters is more, for his knowledge of the place of the underlying cause and incises in it, and pulls his hand away from the instrument from him, as much as is prepared for him until it is forced out.</li><end_turn
Chapter XXXIX.</li><end_turn
Of the extraction of blood clot which is annexed to the marrow.</li><end_turn
When blood clot is medicated with those things which have been said in the division of the treatment with medicines and does not cause discomfort, consider that in the marrow of the patient towards the evening, because you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which you have recommended.</li><end_turn
Therefore if you sometimes see blood clot, extract that which is once small or slightly thick appropriately.</li><end_turn
And if it is not possible for you to extract that, take a concave needle and insert it into the marrow of the patient, and when you have reached the cavity of the needle, put a burning iron there, and do so until (until the blood clot is dead and is separated from the marrow) and restrain him for the whole day.</li><end_turn
And give him to drink a bowl of cold water, and open his mouth with that, and wash his mouth with that; and do not give him anything from that cause and keep the water there for an hour or so with his hand, for the blood clot has as much strength as the water which is there.</li><end_turn
Therefore if it is not forced out by the water which we have recommended, keep the patient suffocated with the instrument which we have recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.</li><end_turn
Do so, so that it falls.</li><end_turn
And another manner of operation in the fumigation of that is that you take a bowl in which are burning charcoal and cover it with a cover in the middle of which is a tube, and put the extremity of the instrument in that tube; and when you have kindled the charcoal, extinguish the smoke; and place the patient’s mouth over the extremity of the needle, and close his mouth so that the smoke is not forced out until you know that the fumigation has reached the blood clot, for the blood clot will then fall down.</li><end_turn<end_turn>
If he does not vomit, repeat the fumigation with vinegar, abstain from nourishing the patient, eat coarse foods and other herbs, do not drink water, and if necessary, do so outside the house.
This is the form of the instrument with which the evacuation of blood is treated from the groin when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps in this way, but sometimes it has some curvature: Which is placed over the groin, and its extremity is similar to the beak of a heron, which is hooked, in which it is grasped from five, so that when pressure is applied to any cause, that which does not yield

In which is the sum of the word concerning the appearance of boils and the section of their treatment.</start_of_turn>
Boils are of various kinds, of various shapes, as it is remembered from some part of this book.</start_of_turn
And they are diverse in puncture and section for two reasons, of which the one is for the kind of boils themselves; and for what they contain of humors.</start_of_turn
The second reason is that in the parts of the body where the boil has occurred, for example, a boil that occurs on the head is different from one that occurs on the buttocks; and a boil that occurs on a fleshy part is different from one that occurs in a joint; and each one of them must be treated according to its operation.</start_of_turn
And there are some boils that must not be pierced except at the appropriate time of the disease in those or with their support.</start_of_turn
So other boils must be cauterized when they are crossed, and are not matured according to their support, as well as boils that are close to joints, for a boil that is close to a joint, if it is prolonged, will corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, because it is a harmful cause of contraction of that limb; or if it is a boil close to a main member, and if you delay the perforation of it when it is mature, it does not benefit the main member; or if it is close to the buttocks, therefore perforate it when it is not mature; and do not perforate cruelly, without proper digestion, but only that which is close to the buttocks, so that you do not weaken the loin of the buttocks, and that there is a fistula, or that it is healed in its entirety that it is not healthy.</start_of_turn It is better that you know the time of the perforation of the boil, and that is when it is mature.</start_of_turn
And you know that it is mature when the pain and fever cease, and the diminishing of swelling and pulse, and the sharpness of the head of the boil, and the other signs.</start_of_turn
And you must know that the perforation must be performed in the place furthest from the boil and where the pus comes out from the care of the eminence.</start_of_turn
The perforation must always be made either along the bone or along the limb, if the boils are in the parts of the head or the feet, and in the places of the lacerations, of the nerves, of the arteries; and finally, in all the places where there is no reflection; for in those where there is reflection, use the perforation according to that limb.</start_of_turn
When the boil is close to a fleshy part, it is better that you wait for the digestion of it to be confirmed before perforating it, as we have said; for if you perforate it before that, you prolong the suffering of the limb and its swelling, and you harden the edges of the boil and its depth.</start_of_turn
Some boils must be perforated according to the breadth of the bone or limb if necessary, or according to what the limb itself demands.</start_of_turn
And you must administer a small perforation, in the large boils a great perforation and wide or many small sections according to the diversity of the size of the boils.</start_of_turn
And others are those boils in which it is necessary that the corden be concave and inflamed, when it is already in its entirety that it should remain, as well as that which occurs in the tropics of dust and boils.</start_of_turn
And of those that are incised with incision having three angles; and of those that are incised like the figure of a mulberry leaf, like the boils of the gonads.</start_of_turn
And of those there are those in which round incision and lunar incision are administered, and they resemble the latter.</start_of_turn
May he who is unable to bear even superficial wounds as after post-leptomes cover that wound, or flatten it as much as possible.
If the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, perforate it immediately and do not hesitate to remove all the pus at that time; having extracted a part, then immediately instill another portion of the abscess back into the other day, and extract a greater portion the next day, and so on until it is forgotten.
Moreover, if the disease is of cold origin, or is in a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man in decrepitude, when the animal spirit of the disease is resolved by the evacuation of pus, and when the disease is greatly diminished, you should perform the operation
Be careful with this chapter and take great care when perforating these abscesses, because you must remove the filth and consider whether the abscess is small and flat, or whether you should administer some external or internal antiseptics; and if the abscess is large and the puncture wounds are numerous, cover that you place a mechanical barrier in any movement until the swelling subsides
If part of the kidney has burst in the abscess or if you have softened that in the circuit, cover that you bind that part with old cloth or with thread like thread, just as when you draw threads or bones, when there is moisture; and keep it closed for the third day; and when it is finished, care for the wound as to prevent infection until it is healed.
Moreover, if blood flows out during your operation, administer cold water and vinegar in the place where a thread of silk has been drawn out, and stop that over the area of the blood flow until the bleeding has ceased
Moreover, if bleeding persists, cover that you administer regimen and care as I have recommended in many places of this book and in our division.
Moreover, if it is winter and the place of the abscess is a place of many nerves, cover that you sprinkle pepper in wine and oil, and put those on the places.
Moreover, if it is summer and the places are fleshy, cover that you sprinkle powder with eggs in water and oil or in wine and oil, and keep that until the third day, as we have said, and when the abscess is removed, remove that and administer the treatment that is appropriate for it until it is healed
And thus it is necessary to have knowledge of the treatment of abscesses throughout, however, according to the way of distinguishing which has already been said concerning every abscess, in what manner it is treated by chapters individually
Chapter LXI.</start_of_turn>
Of the incision of abscesses which occur in the kidney of the head.
In the small kidney of the head there are small abscesses, and of the kind which contain tunics which make them; and the size of them is great
And from these there are drops, and those which contain moisture similar to lime. And from those which contain moisture similar to urine, and resembling stones; and from those which are like pebbles, hard
And in the incision of all these, and in the extraction of those, fear not, as the extension of those does not make the wound harmful.
The operation of incision of these is that you express them with an instrument of the kind which you see me bring, which is called an entrometrum, until you see that it contains what you think
For if what is contained is moisture, then cut that according to the length by superficial incision as follows:
And begin in the incision of the line of B to the line of G. When the moisture is evacuated, then you will extract that by which that moisture is contained, and do not leave any cause of that, for troops that are left over will return, if there remains any cause of that
And immediately immerse the wound in Egyptian unguents, if there is any, or in water and salt; and fill that with the wound and leave that until tomorrow, for that which is left over will decay all that remains of that membrane.
And repeat over that wound with Egyptian unguents according to what is indicated and until you are confident that no cause of that membrane remains; then care for the wound with that ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodes, then cut that as follows I am sectioned, having no form of cross, and grasp nails between two lips of the section and run away from all parts, and exert your virtue in extracting the tunic which contains that.
May it be that your incision makes the matter worse, but I will tell you first of all
And thus we do in the softened abscess of the section and care; as you have heard; and the section over the softened abscess is lighter, which is less painful and has less humidity
And many veins are like these abscesses which are in the head of the homes among whom there is no humidity; which cause that we do not see an abscess in the head of an old woman even though we press on it like a deaf, rough, white stone, which cannot be drunk, and if there is any at all in that which we press, it swells that
But in other abscesses that happen in the head, this is not the head, just as abscesses that happen at the heads of children and must be due to the roots of the nails, although the section of these is superficial
And stop the perforation of those from the lower part of them so that the body of the pain is relieved from the lower parts
And take care of those with what is necessary for care.
Chapter 52.
Of the section of carbuncles that happen in the groin.
The veins that flow through these abscesses go through the groin and the buttocks and the flanks; and some veins happen in the other parts of the body
And those that happen in the groin, and those that are generated between them, and all carbuncles of these are devoid of their own tunic, just as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said
And the species of these carbuncles are veins, which are some of them soft, and those that contain humidity, and those that are malignant which do not obey care
Therefore, when you sometimes have good intention in the touch, of which the color of the liquid which appears is appropriate for the color of cod liver, and is very black throughout, and is not connected with the nerves of the groin, or with the veins, or with the incision, and is not a wound, as you can see in the case of the abscesses of the head, scrape away everything from the surface of the part down to the part beyond the body of the line of G within the line of B, and scrape away everything throughout, and pull out two lips of the cod liver with nails, or with teeth if you need them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract that little by little.
And take more care not to puncture the vein or nerve.
And let the sponge not be too acute, that it does not fit your hand on the incision, or that it irritates the patient, and that you do not irritate anything that is not necessary to irritate; for if you irritate the vein or the incision, you will prevent your operation, for when you have a wound of the vein or the incision and you prohibit the flow of blood, the hour you pause the bleeding, and open the wound, leave that which is within until the acute pain of the abscess has passed and the wound has become softened and the wound has become somewhat fluid When the blood is drained out
Therefore return to your operation until you have completed it.
And ask if there is any other small carbuncle, so irritate those and wash those.
And if it is in the root of the large vein, cover that hour that you do not irritate that carbuncle from its root. Go away and cover that like a faithful dog, and leave that within until it falls by itself spontaneously.
And then fill the wound with old cloth which you have already soaked in Egyptian unguent, and take care of that.
And if you irritate that carbuncle throughout, the hour cover that you adjust the two lips of the wound and keep them together so that no excess remains.
But if there is sometimes excess of liquid due to the greatness of the carbuncle, cover that you understand how to puncture the root of that, and remove that and administer suture and what is said
And as for the carbuncles that contain humidity, pierce that with a superficial perforation here where you see its maturity, and pause the perforation of that which is below the body, as we have said
E aprop aministra perforacio, calguas am enguent e semblantz ad aquels, per so que corroda aquo que es romas de la corropcio. And then when the plague has already subsided, then care for that which is warm from the generated flesh until it is healed
(The text ends abruptly here, indicating the end of the treatise.)
From the excision of the pillar of the apostem, the apostematist does not give him the poullet.
I say that this excision in the heel has never been seen in our land that anyone has ever done
And this is the inscription of the sermon of those [doctors].
And in the houses they do not suffer from incontinence, cover that the extraction of the heel is avoided, as it is not useful for the healing of all the veins and the greater part of the disease is here
And in those who have apostemas caused in the mouth or the heel or two nails, when the disease is not in the bone, cover to use the excision of the heel to escape the loss which is useful for perforation
Therefore when we want that it should be done, let them inscribe the heel leaving three circles of the circles of the heel, or four at most for the width in that which is between two circles in quantity, that the incision be in cartilage, not in the cartilage, and this place is convenient for incision, as it is devoid of flesh and the vessels of life are found there
And if the doctor is weak, cover that he extends the tendon of the heel with oil, and then make the incision of the tendon until it reaches the canal, but avoid the vessels of life if you see any of those for any reason
And then make the incision little by little as we have recommended; and it is signified about the incision of the canal for the flame which is of that which is in it is dissolved with oil which is of it.
And leave the wound open for some time
Therefore when the hour is ripe in which the perforation is feared, add two layers of fat to the edge of the wound, and so only will remain the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that make the flesh grow until it is healed
And say Albucasis that the sum of the sermon which we have recommended, exposure is nothing but that you see that some of these apostemas have already opined the heel of the disease, and the disease is avenged within death, and the cause of it is between them, and these go to incision the epiglottis so that the disease can breathe over the location of the wound for any breath, and is saved from death.
And therefore I command to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease is consumed; and the malice of it is for three days; and therefore I command you to close the wound when it is healed, and care for that until it is healed
And what I have seen for my part is that a servant brought a bowl and put it in the heel of the patient and incised it in that place a part of the bone of the thumb, and I was called to the care of it, and I covered the blood with oil like it is done from the dead, and I uncovered the wound and covered the wound with silk which was sitting in the wound little.
Therefore I confessed that no vessel or nerve had been injured, and that the blood had flown out of the wound, and I cured it until it was healed
And I did not reproach the servant if she did not recover her voice, and I told her that she should return to her duties
And now I say that there is no fear in the incision of the heel
(The text ends abruptly here, indicating the end of the treatise.)
From the incision about the apostemas which happen outside the heel, and is called hernia of the heel.
This apostema which is called hernia of the heel is great according to the color of the limb, and is not in the women.
And it is according to two manners, that is, either natural or accidental
And in the natural one it is not a matter of cure
And the accidental one is according to two manners, one of which is like grass knots, and the other manner is like a apostem which is caused by the knotting of an artery, and in that one there is fear And do not presume with them as with iron, but only in the one who is small. And thus you inquire that which is similar to knots of fat, and if you find it resembling fatty nodes and not suspended from any vein, then you must pierce it as with the nodes, and extract that which is contained within the skin and fat; and if not, then it is prescribed to do all that is necessary, and take care of the area with that which covers the cure until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XLV.</end_turn>
On the section of the fatty nodes.</end_turn>
Of the nodes there are two kinds, and I have already said all their kinds in the division.</end_turn
And I command that you take notice of the difference between a node and an extrusion, as it makes doubt.</end_turn
Therefore I say that an extrusion is a heat, fever, and severe pain until the excess of the fluid is sedated; and it is completed by putrefaction when the fever, the pain, and the heat cease.</end_turn
A node is neither heat nor fever nor pain, but contains that oily liquid which is in its belly or sac.</end_turn
And it is according to the color of the body, and they commence like cheese and are effective just as wax, whether large or small, and they are of two kinds, those that are fatty and contain moisture, and those that are dry, as I said in the division.</end_turn
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a node, that you expel that and inquire about that at the commencement when the surrounding discomfort is called inward, as it will appear in the chapter that follows.</end_turn
And this is the way to inquire of boils and of all nodes, that you grasp this discomfort and expel that which you find in the most humid place of the boil, and you will remove the strings that say that the discomfort has already penetrated the cord.</end_turn
And finally put your hand according to the measure of the size of the boil, and then extract the inwardness and consider what remains of it.</end_turn
And if the current moisture, whatever its color, has been expelled, then you must pierce it on the surface according to what I have said in other boils.</end_turn
And if there is no moisture remaining from the inwardness, then you know that it is fat.</end_turn
And dry it over it in the manner of a cross according to this form: thus as I have taught you, and suspend that which is sticky, and remove the cord from all around easily, and keep the skin or sac, if possible, over that and extract the marrow from the node.</end_turn
But if it is broken in the operation, it is not possible to extract that marrow, and many veins are seen to be filled with blood, and you must extract it piecemeal until no cause remains.</end_turn
For if there remains any cause, little or much, the node returns as before.</end_turn
And if you sometimes find that some small part remains, then complete the wound with several corrosive powders and strengthen the dressing, and stop over that which is the cause of the boil, and care for the other treatment until it is healed.</end_turn
And if the node is large, then you must support its lips and care for that which surrounds it.</end_turn
But if a pulsating vein is on the contrary, or non-pulsating, then you must cover it and fill the area with wool that is rough and coarse, and cover that with a strap for two days or three until the wound has healed and the fever has subsided; and then you can return to extracting what remains of the node.</end_turn
Chapter XLVI.</end_turn
Of the forms of the discomforts necessary in the section and perforation.</end_turn
Of those there are three forms of inwardness, which are great, medium, and small.</end_turn
The great form of inwardness is like this:</end_turn
The small form of inwardness is like this:</end_turn
Use iron, saffron, fallen extremities appropriately, so that you can fix the instruments in the boils.</end_turn
These are the forms of the experts, and they are named albered, and one of them is called berid.
And there are three kinds, of which one is great, middle, and small
The great expert's form:
The middle expert's form
The small expert's form
I believe that these are for those who have apostemas and exits and fistulas and abscesses so that between these there are bones and other causes.
And so round, gross, lions, horses, just like great needles with which the threads are sewn, and these are made of citrus, or of gold, or of iron, or of silver, and the miles are when they are made of citrus
And they are made of black plum seeds, which remember that for these are opened the fistulas in the cavity from which reflections are reflected, which are reflected back from their elevation to those reflections
And there are three kinds, of which some are long, and of the others middle, and of the others short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the stricture of it
The great expert's form of plum:
The middle expert's form of plum
The small expert's form of plum
The forms of nails are of three kinds, of which some are simple, which have only a curve, and three kinds: great, small and middle.
And there are blunt nails, and three kinds.
And of these there are nails having two curves, and three kinds
And of these there are nails having three curves, and three kinds
And all these are necessary in their place
The form of a small simple nail, its form
The form of a great nail having two curves The form of a middle nail having two curves The form of a small nail having two curves
The form of a great nail having three curves
The form of a middle nail having three curves
These are the forms of the scalpels with which the nodes and abscesses are cut and scorched, and there are three kinds, of which one is great, middle, and small.
The great scapel form
The middle scapel form
The small scapel form
The extremities of these with which the incision is made are acute and the others are not acute, and they are not stopped in such a way, but that it may be useful in the excision of the nodes, the fear of injuring a vein or nerve, and for those that it may be healthy for the patient and bring tranquility when it finds relief of the discomfort from which the excision of the abscess is made
These are the forms of pills, and there are three kinds: great, middle, and small, just like beans
They are made of earth and are similar to rays with the which the alcohol is made.
And it is at the distant puncture with hidden sponge and in that which runs to the teeth and outwards, when you go, just like seeing them.
The forms of spatimis, which are hidden among the teeth of the thumbs, cause the perforation of the apostemas and are not perceived as ailments, and are of three species: great, medium, and small. These are the forms of those:
The forms of winds that break the flow of blood, and are of three species; great, medium, and small; the forms of them:
Are caused by yellow bile, round with any length, and are subtle.
And that these species of winds cause your great, medium, and small ones to break the flow of blood quickly, and when this happens there is no longer any medicine for it.
But do not use them to break blood in all parts of the body, and do not use them in fleshy places, such as in the cavities of the thighs and legs, and in the cavities of the chest, and in the nipples and belly and armpits, and keep them away from all fleshy wounds.
And many other ointments are useful for these instruments and little things that resemble fish scales according to this form; for which blood is broken when it is done by phlebotomy, or incision of a vein or artery
And many ointments are useful round according to this form:
Capitol xlvii.
Of the care of the breasts of men which are composed of women.
Some ointments swell the breasts of solitary men because of their sleep when they begin to become pale, and also swell the breasts, and gather the breasts of women, and keep them away from the apostemas, leaving them.
And to him who is tormented by this, cover that it be sectioned with a lunar incision according to this form, from the line of B to the line of G, and immediately remove the whole thickness, and apply the plaster of an ointment that is appropriate, and adjust the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for what is inside so that it is healed
More so if the breast slopes downwards towards the back and is softened by its size as it does with women, when it is split into two lateral cuts more than sufficient, according to a lunar incision, from the line B to the line G, of which each half is contained in the other one except for the end of each, until the greater line contains the smaller one according to this form of the line B and G. And immediately remove the cord that is between the two lips of the wound, and keep the swelling down, and administer what has been said of the suture and the dressing that is necessary for the care until it is healed
And if you do not comply with the incision of this which covers the incision due to the discomfort of the patient and the flow of blood, then cover that you immerse the wound in corrosive ointment and leave that which is removed when the grease is consumed, and keep that which is inside until it is healed
Capitol xlviii.
Of the perforation of apostemas which are caused from behind the nipples
These apostemas which are caused from behind the nipples are of the species of scorpions, hard, which contain a sac that is like a bladder
And of those which contain humidity; and those which contain humidity cover that they be sectioned with a lunar incision according to this figure: from the line G to the line B. And when everything is evacuated from the apostema of the urine, then immediately fill up the cavity and remove it the next day
And keep the cavity both empty and cured with convenient ointment until it is healed
And if the apostema is of the species of knots, and of the scorpions, then cut through that as well as we have said in the section about the scorpions evenly
And if the wound is extended in such a way that it is almost imperceptible, then administer in it the cautery as we have mentioned above.
Capitol xlix.
Of the incision of apostemas which occur by means of an artery or a vein.
When an artery is ruptured, and the cord which is above that is solidified which is over that, then move the ointments that occur after the apostema. And it is known that these cause inflammation and apostema due to the artery or the vein: for when the apostema is due to an artery, it is long increased in the belly of the body; and that when you put in the apostema into the thighs, sitting in the places where there is a loud noise
He who is of the vein returns to the surface of the body.
Except in this case, it is an error to leave the testicles, the veins, the armpits, the groin, and various parts of the body; for it is not great, therefore cover that their cure should be evaded, and that which is in the limbs or the head, that it should be avoided.</end_of_turn>
More about that in whom for inflammation of the orifice of the artery, split in the codena section in the long; and immediately wipe the split with sponges and immediately apply the artery, and remove the tunicas until it is discovered.</end_of_turn
And immediately put over that needle and make that penetrate through to the other side, and tighten the artery with a firm double knot in two places, — which causes your fainting in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
And immediately put pressure on the place which is between two ligaments with a sponge until the blood clot has gone, and dissolve the swelling.</end_of_turn>
And immediately administer care in which is engendered poverty until the ligaments fall; and immediately care for that which is convenient at will until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And if it is a swelling from a broken vein, then cover that you have your hand over the swelling at the root of the swelling, and immediately insert the needle where you left your hand, and make that penetrate; and make a double fold in that place until you extract that which is from the other side, and immediately ligate the swelling with good ligament as I have said to you in the book of two parts of two limbs.</end_of_turn
More if you fear that you will extract the vein, then immediately insert the needle with that needle where all the swelling must be removed from the incision of the first needle, and strengthen the ties in four places.</end_of_turn
And immediately dry the swelling in the middle of it until when it is sitting there, the hours you have incisions the superfluous of the codena, and leave what is bound to it.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop with the powder which you have soaked in wine and oil, and immediately administer the care which is useful with warmth and ointment until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter of the swelling that happens from the twisting of nerves.</end_of_turn>
Similarly as it happens with swelling in arteries and veins, and in the same way that swelling happens in nerves when it happens to them by percussion or from excessive work, and for the same reason.</end_of_turn
And it is useful to know more in the places of the assistants or the heel, or in any place where there are many joints.</end>
And it is a difficult swelling, and is similar in color to the rest of the body, and is in the greatest of them when it is disposed of them and when it is stretched with violence, sitting in it the patient resembling a madman.</end_of_turn
And it is not a swelling that occurs in the front of the body, and for so leave the codena, and it is more painful throughout and does not go to the front or back parts.</end_of_turn
Therefore of those who are in the joints do not cover that it should be enclosed with iron, because great force would be required to contract it.</end_of_turn
More the one that is in the head or in the front of the head closes the codena with a sponge.</end_of_turn More if it is a little swelling, then immediately tell him that and cut away that which is of no use.</end_of_turn
And if it is great, then immediately suspend it with a bandage, and drain that, and immediately do that; and tighten the bandage with stitches, and care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter ends.</end_of_turn>
Of cutting of swelling that happens from the heel that happens to the belly.</end_of_turn
It ends up at the nails of those women who wear stockings in the bellies of those and in the other parts of the body of those who are affected by fungal diseases similar to those which have fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is thick; and already the lips of those are spoken of, and it is of those that is small, and is of those that is not magnificent.</end_of_turn
And I have already seen one in the belly of which there were two patients who were greater than fungi resembling each other, and there was no difference between the white ones, of little root.</end_of_turn
The lips of those patients were swollen and puffy, and moisture ran from them all the time.
Therefore I recommend that you insert your finger into the hollow of the foot where it hurts and the other that you see it there.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider the time if the disease is humous, and if the colour of the boils is white, humous, from slight causes; then you will make a small incision with the point of your scissors, and while you are present there cauterize the focus, because the black matter that has been expelled from the incision must be expelled without delay; and if you blow out the black matter, cauterize it again
And if sometimes the disease is painful and fearful, hold your hand off the incision with a pincer; however the time has passed recently made, and strengthen that boil, which is the manner in which we have said; and let it rest for two days.
And so adjust in the stiffness of the thread of the pincer; therefore, do not cease strengthening the pincer greatly until it is detached and falls away by itself
However, if there is a great cause, the time in the incision of them is a cause of fear and pain, especially in that which is in the belly
Perhaps you will have to make an incision of the greater part of it, and then cauterize that so that it does not return.
And so take care of that until the wound is healed
And keep in mind that you do not presume to make an incision of that which is of yellow colour, of little sensation, of little regard, because that is abscesses
And I remind you that I have forgotten nothing concerning this matter
Chapter 52
On the care of the navel's eminence
The eminence of the navel is caused by many causes; or for cracks of the sacrum which is over the belly, and these you will cover with cloth or swelling as in other ruptures; or for healing which flows from veins or arteries as is said above, or for windiness that is stifled in it.
However, if it is for a crack of the sacrum and for swelling of the cloth, the colour of the pus is similar to the colour of blood; and it is painful, and appears in various positions And if it is for the evacuation of the bowels, the time in which it is in that place from which we have recounted, of more or less diverse ways, and as you have previously said that which we must consider concealed, and then return; and if you blow out that which is in the bowels, it is strengthened greatly by the introduction of bath and violent work
However, if it is for moisture, the time is painful and is not concealed when you place your hand over it, nor is it constricted, nor is it swollen
And if it is for healing, the time until this black appears again is declining
However, if there is no bone, the time is pus thick, thick and hard, and is fixed according to a quantity
However, if it is for windiness, the time for it is painful
And the operation in it is that you consider the time if the navel's eminence is for the healing of an artery or a vein, or for windiness; the time that you must prohibit the care of it, because in that case there is fear and pain just as I have said concerning the pus for an artery and a vein
And if the navel's eminence is for the bowels or for the cloth, the time that you command the patient to have his legs stretched out; and that you put your hand over the circumference of all the navel, and that you order him to place his hands between your two thighs, and that you surround the circumference of the navel around the area where you have said that you put your hand; and that you extend the bulk of the pus to the buttocks as much as one can; and that you bind the circumference tightly or loosely and gently
And so you will bring out the other part of the pus extended over the ligament and put your finger into that place and you will ask him to expel the bowel; and if you have not observed or guarded for the ligament, the time that you have extracted will expel the bowel from the parts of the belly.
And if you have found the cloth, the time takes that which is one time; and you will make incisions of the surplus of it.
May it be contrary to your surgery or vein, when you have encircled that limb, and you have returned to your operation; take two needles and pierce through those two holes firmly, and insert two needles into the circumference which you have made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, which shall penetrate; and then strengthen the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, leave the needles in and let the swelling subside until the extended flesh falls off by itself; or cut away that which is subtle and will fall off, and then cure that which remains inside until it is healed.
And if the swelling of the navel is neither of flesh nor of moisture, when you have covered the abscess as we have said and drawn out the disease or moisture which you find in it, then cure that which remains inside and consolidate the area

Of the treatment of abscess.</start_of_turn>
We have already said, in the division, about the species of abscess and how to treat it with medicines, and that it is dangerous to treat it with fire so that it does not become ulcerated; and we have said that abscesses are caused by great pain and caution in their treatment.</start_of_turn
And I say that some old doctors believe that certain abscesses are incurable in their place, just as some abscesses which are in the breasts or in the groin and are similar to those which are in the limbs and which must be removed in order to remove all of that, and more so when they are small.</start_of_turn
When it is old and is severe, do not attempt to touch it, for I have never seen it healed by such a means, neither have I seen anyone else, nor is it possible for it to be cured by this.</start_of_turn
And the operation for it is when it is possible, as we have said, that you precede by evacuating the patient and purging with black bile several times, and then sprinkle that [medicine] on it, if it is found to be present in excess.</start_of_turn
And then prepare the patient for the operation in the way in which it is located in the operation, and put on the gloves to cover that; and with great care move from every side around the cord around the abscess until no cause remains of the reasons for its existence.</start_of_turn And let the wound run its course, and do not touch it carelessly, and press the parts, and evacuate the pus with your hand or with an instrument.
And if it seems contrary to the course of the wound to make an incision of a vein or an artery, when the flow of the wound has ceased, then cauterize that which remains until the bleeding has ceased, and then cure that which remains of the other treatment until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Chapter 54.</start_of_turn
Of the treatment of dropsy.</start_of_turn
We have already recounted, in the division, the species of dropsy of water, and their symptoms, and the treatment of them with medicines.</start_of_turn
And that which is treated with fire is only the species of ulcers alone, and it is not approached with fire to the species of tympani or to the species of swelling, for that is deadly.</start_of_turn
And when you have treated this species of dropsy of the tympani with medicines and do not confirm your medicine, then consider that if the patient has already achieved relief from the pain, or if there is another disease alongside this one, just as if it were in the throat or the chest, do not give him fire, for fear of that.</start_of_turn
And if sometimes the patient has an excessive vomiting, and there is no other disease but simple dropsy, neither young nor old, then the manner of the operation for it is that you elevate the patient between your legs, and hold his belly with your hand, fill the water to the part beyond the navel, and take sponge sponges in this way:
both of two acute ends long, with the acute extremity thus as sponge; but indeed in any slight space small by small, so that in the operation for it there does not enter into the intestine, and that you lead out that.</start_of_turn
And consider if the generation of dropsy is from the intestines, for in that case you must be at the navel for the amount of three fingers beyond, in the tract of it over the navel.</start_of_turn
And if the generation of dropsy is from a disease of the spleen, then your incision should be to the left of the navel for three fingers.</start_of_turn
If the cause of their suffering is the spleen, then their section should be in the left side.
It is not necessary to make the incision over the cost over which the patient is suffering, for fear of bringing on further harm to that sensitive area.
And then pierce through the instrument all the way to the spleen, and enter into that area, and lift your hand over the sponge between the cord and the skin, and you will extract it; and if there is any quantity of blood or pus, do so cautiously
And then pierce the sac until the sponge reaches the place it wants to go, which is the place of the water And then extract it and insert an instrument of this kind: and it is similar to a silver needle; it is made of silver or ebony or gold, and at the lower part of it is a little hook, and on the sides of it are three hooks: two on one side and one on the other side; and its handle is pointed according to the manner of a pen, just as sometimes:
And at the end of the procedure, the armillary bandage should be applied, because when the instrument reaches the water, then so much blood will be evacuated from the instrument that a large amount of blood will be evacuated in that moment. If you evacuate less than this in an hour, then much more pain will remain from the solution of the vital spirit or from the injuries to the five senses that are close to death
Evacuate in this way according to the quantity of the virtue of the patient and according to what you understand from the patient's condition and the benefit of the patient's virtue and the fear of his death.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the blood which causes this, because so much of it is retained by the sponge which retains the hook that is over the sac from which it comes. I recommend that you perform this according to that manner.
And so repeat the instrument another day if the patient tolerates it, and extract a small quantity of blood, and do this for several days in order to be careful, and keep yourself from making a mistake until there is little or no blood left
But if you are afraid of the patient, and you see that there is a great quantity of blood, then cure that one by burying it in lukewarm sand, bathe his wound in broth, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and cure that one with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize over the stomach, and the spleen and the liver are close to the evacuation of the blood, according to what I have recounted in what precedes.

Concerning the care of children whose urinary organs have not yet been perforated.</start_of_turn>
Some women believe that with some of the children the head of the mixture is not perforated (or is slightly torn or is not in its proper place).</start_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to cover as much as possible that which is born with a sponge quite soft in this way:
And put under the hole a soft plum nail and bind it, and keep it for three days or for four days
When he wants to urinate, he should be urged to urinate, and then return it.</start_of_turn>
And if you do not stop the nail, it is possible that the urine which goes over the place will not reach this hole.</start_of_turn
But if the hole is very small, it should be treated with a plum nail, as we have said, for three days before it becomes enlarged.</start_of_turn
But those in which the hole is not in its place, that is to say, those in whom the cause is that the head of the bladder is twisted so that it cannot urinate downwards, until you elevate the bladder with your hand to the upper parts; and it is not for the generation, for in this case the sperm cannot reach the woman according to custom, and this is an ailment that does not go away.</start_of_turn>
The manner of performing the operation for this is that the patient should be placed over the genitals, and then extend the head of the bladder with your left hand during extraction, and pierce the head of the bladder of the belly of the fetus with a sharp sponge, just as if it were written with a pen, or that you do not cut any part, so that the membrane should remain similar to the head of the bladder and that the hole should fall in the proper place as much as possible.</start_of_turn

The swelling which happens in the groin at the head of the testicles, of swelling and bruising and blackening and adhesion of the testicles at the head of the testicles.
This swelling happens usually in the testicles and is an indication of bad blood circulation.
And from this there are two kinds: one is malignant and the other is not malignant.
Not malignant: if you suspend it with a sponge and bind up what is inside until all the swelling has gone down; and then place your hand over that area to support it, and do this until it is healed.
And if the swelling is malignant, of a dark colour, then you must administer cautery close to the origin of the swelling and in the ratio of the swelling.
May be if the swelling is in the groin not circumcised, and one part of the swelling is inwards and the other part is outwards, then you must keep the swelling inwards until it is consolidated; and when you have cured that outwards, because when you have cured that outwards, it is not certain that the inwards will not be broken through.
And already the swelling happens in the genitals and in the groin blackening and corruption, where you must conquer everything that is already blackened and that is already becoming corrupted or that is already corrupted; and put pressure over that area until it is better, which is made with flour of barley and millet seeds and with lead shot and nails.
And do this until it is healed
May be if there is discharge of pus, then administer lunar cautery in this way:
because the cautery will be useful both for the pus discharge and for the plague when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the testicles is corroded and is destroyed in an hour, then you must insert into the meat of the testicles a a plum catheter so that the patient can urinate through that
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the testicles (and this adhesion does not happen except in that of which the prepuce is soft, and over it circumcision is not required; and when it happens through plague or by swelling) you must scrape with an obtus sponge until the ligament is dissolved and the head of the testicles is relaxed entirely.
And if it is difficult to remove them completely, then you must scrape with a sponge over the head of the testicles and the prepuce, and help so that the prepuce, when it is soft, is perforated by its softness itself
And then separate the prepuce from the head of the testicles with a strip of fine silk, which already is wet in the cold water so that it does not adhere to another swelling.
And do this until it is healed with wine bandage until it is consolidated
The swelling which happens in the groin at the head of the testicles, of swelling and bruising and blackening and adhesion of the testicles at the head of the testicles.
Of the upbringing of children and the care of those who are circumcised
Circumcision is not a solution to the continuity of life just like any other plague: however, even if it is of our operation and our will, and although it is properly done in children, it is necessary that we assign in this better operation and way less suffering loss of life.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision in any of their laws, because it is not found in their laws, and it is only because we have learned through experience that many surgeons and barbers use circumcision and upbringing with new methods and with nails; and they use thread and gum.
And I myself have tried all these methods and I do not find any better way than with forceps, thread and gum in upbringing like with nails, because many veins flee from the wound, because the cord of the prepuce is doubled over two tunics, and remains more relaxed, and the tension is greater behind than in front, and therefore it is more easily perforated at another incision and with greater pain And in upbringing for alphbetism, which is digital, of which the barbers use, the incision of the extremity of the member is not followed, because it is strong and enters the cavity of it
However in the operation with nails, because of the iron and the corruption of the work And the cord of the child is short by nature, and many swellings do not need upbringing in this way, and I have seen it.
May be the cause of the discomfort that comes from the forfexes and ligaments is the excessive tension of the bones, for the acute that is above is equal to the acute that is below; and therefore as you touch your hand so are provided two acute ones, and incisions are made according to a comparison in a time; and it is a useful compression of the faithful figure containing the codena of the whole part, without which there is no error of any kind.
The manner of the first operation is that you must make the child lie down if he is young, that you do not force him but rather lie him down on his side alone, and that you leave him like that until the next day.
And thus do that which pleases in all this manner as much as you are able, because he who receives your intelligence And thus do that your hands are prepared to stay between your thighs, and do not be inert; and hide the forfexes in your hand or at the feet of the child, so that he does not see them or any other instruments.
And thus do put your hand on the belly of the child and breathe in the cavity, and pull that which is within until it reaches the head of the cavity, and then modify that which is added to it from the outside.
The way of the forfexes in the manipulation, this is the way:
The one is blunt at the tip and the other is pointed, that it is not seen from the thumb, and the length of the two acute ones is as much as the length of two thumbs equally.</end_turn>
More the error in manipulation is that it forces out the intrinsic codena of the whole, or part of it from the incision.</end_turn>
Therefore you must extend that which is from your hand towards your nail before the retraction of the area and that you make the incision according to equality.</end_turn
And if you cannot have it at your nail, then extract that with a hook and make the incision.</end_turn>
More if three days have passed, and remain what is swollen below the cavity, then you must leave that until the swelling of the wound has gone down, and evacuate that with ease, and make the incision as you are prepared.</end_turn
And take care of the head of the cavity, because it will not be useful to it.</end_turn>
Therefore care for that which is in which the wound has consolidated from the powders that we have recommended in the treatise of the powders.</end_turn
And if it is incut with measure, and you obey to the parts above, then you will not notice it.</end_turn><end_turn>
And more care for that which we have said until it is healed.</end_turn><end_turn>

Of the care of retained urine in the bladder.</end_turn>
Retained urine in the bladder is useful for excessive fullness by stone or for constipation, or for weakness or for tumor, and it remains as those which we have said concerning the methods of care in the division.</end_turn
And if it is not dissolved as we have said beforehand, it is useful to know the cause of the patient, for you must administer extraction of it with an instrument which is called siringua, of which this is the form: of silver and of hammered gold conquered, like a pen with a needle of gold as long as a palm, to which be added a tube of silver at the head of it.</end_turn
And take the urine from the patient, having first doubled the faith and placed it on the edge of the wound or ulcer for a good connection; then introduce the faith into the part below the circumference of the wound, and prick with needles if there is any excess of the wound, but do not introduce the needle too deeply. And immediately increase the circumference of the wound with border and album of oil.
And make the patient spit on the heel, and bandage the wound and the edge with olive oil and vinegar, and olive oil and herbs.</end_of_turn>
And immediately introduce the circumference around the ease of the wound so that it reaches the root of the ulcer; and immediately double the ulcer downwards to the level of the navel; and immediately press the circumference inwards so that the wound is not too tight; and immediately press that inwards so that it reaches the bladder, and that will make the patient be relieved of the cause of the wound, and it is not good like this, but rather in the place where there is torment.</end_of_turn>
And gradually pull out the faith with the wound so that the urine wets the wound.</end_of_turn>
And take out that and do urine therapy, and use a sponge, do not leave it inside and use a sponge until the bladder is evacuated and the patient feels relief.</end_of_turn>

Of the quality of the bladder catheterization clamp and the instruments that are in agreement with it.</end_of_turn
When there is an ulcer or swelling in the bladder, or if it is contracted too tightly, and you wish to drain urine and medicines, then it is good to use a catheter with a clamp, and this is how it is done:
Unless in the part it is deaf, so is closed.</end_of_turn And there are three channels: two from one side, like how many times.</end_of_turn
At the beginning it is soft, in which there is water that is rolled up, and as much as it is pressed, so will be added, until when any cause is over that is thrown from the humors, it is thrown out, and when it is expelled, the water is thrown out as much as it was thrown in, and when it is expelled long, as the clamp does which is placed on the naptha of the sea battles.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you wish to expel humors from the bladder, insert the extremity of the clamp into the humor, and draw out that water that is rolled up to the parts below, because the humor is expelled from the concavity of the clamp.</end_of_turn
And immediately insert the extremity of the clamp into the ulcer according to what we have recommended in the circumference; and immediately press the humor with water, because that humor will reach the bladder immediately, and the patient will feel relieved of that.</end_of_turn
Form of the subtle catheter for which the bladder is catheterized, and that is the following form:</end_of_turn
And it is good to make it of silver or of lead, of which the head is like a small plume, and leave it inside without any support.</end_of_turn
And immediately take the bladder from movement, and stop in that the humor you wish to catheterize in the bladder, and immediately bind that between two strong ligatures with a doubled faith, and scald that humor over the fire.</end_of_turn
And immediately insert the extremity of the catheter into the ulcer.</end_of_turn
And immediately put your hand over the bladder with the humor stretched out until the patient feels that that humor has already reached the bladder.</end>
But if your bladder is not present, then take a little sponge and make a circle of it; and pierce that through its whole roundness; and immediately insert a strong faith through those holes, even though it is revolted; and immediately add the circle so that it is added to the bath, because you have stopped in that water that you wish to expel humors from, and oil and herbs.</end_of_turn
And immediately bind that to the instrument and do as you did with the bladder, and express with your hand until the humor reaches the bladder.</end_of_turn
Chapter 60.</end_of_turn
Of the extraction of stones.</end_of_turn
We have already said in the division the species of stones and their care with medicines, and the difference between stones generated in the phlegmas and stones generated in the bladder, and we have mentioned that.</end_of_turn
And we have said that the pain in the foot which we are now dealing with is called gout.
And the pain which is caused by the cold humors that infiltrate the body is called gout.
And thus we are stating that the exposure of the disease is clear and concise
Therefore I say that the pain which is caused in the bladder mainly affects children; and from the symptoms of the disease it is known that the urine which comes out of the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and appears in that sand; and the disease is accompanied by frequent vomiting, pale face and swelling of the belly.
And it is laughable that the children recover from this within fourteen years; and it is difficult to cure them when they are old Indeed in the young it is easier because of that which exists between these two
And of that which the cause of the disease is greater and the cure is easier; and if it is little, it is contrary to that.
Therefore when we reach the cure of that, cover at the beginning of that which we must change the cause of the disease which makes the whole wound which is in the joints of the thighs; because that wound many times prevents the infection of the bladder due to the inquiry of the disease.
And thus prescribe the disease to the thighs and feet and count and hold the hand of the patient so that the bladder may descend to its place or that some of the intestines may be thrown out
And thus do that which is between your thighs, and that most of them shall leave the cushions of their thighs so that the whole bladder may be easily drained downwards to the parts below
And thus do all of those things which have been said before.
Therefore if you feel the pain in the space, then do so with a pointed cautery to cut around it as much as possible
And if you do not feel all of it, then touch with your hand the area which we call the left hand, if the disease is in children, or say half if it is an adult, and enter with that into the thigh behind the knee And inquire about the pain until it has left the knee And turn that little by little inside the belly of the bladder
And thus put your hand over that which we call the left hand, and expel that to the outside of the body in the place from which we made the incision
Command the minister to hold the bladder with his left hand; and command another minister to extend the thighs with his right hand and with his left hand grasp the skin which is left behind the thighs, from the place where the incision was made
And thus do the above-mentioned things, this is the way of them: And cut between the knee and the thigh, not in the middle of the thigh, towards the left side of the left cushion; and make the incision over that pain and the said hand should be held either in the thigh or at the knee, and make a transverse incision, so that the incision outside may be wide enough for the amount of urine which comes out of the bladder to be possible, and not greater, for if you make it too wide you will compress the hand which is in the thigh behind the knee due to the incision, and it will be useless to you
And be aware that of the pain there is some degree and margin, for that is difficult for it to be cured
And of that urine which comes out is like lukewarm lukewarm, it is round, and it is good for it to be lukewarm
Therefore if that is the degree which is at the angles and margins, join in the fissure
And if it is not thus widely performed, then do so that your hand rests upon that, or that you strengthen over that limb conveniently, the limb which is like a limb to which you strengthen over the pain, and do not omit that; or that you put the instrument inside in order to curve the limb.
And if you do not succeed over that, then expand a little the wound, and if you see a flow of urine, cut away that which is yellow and acrid.
And if the pain is more than one, then at the beginning put your hand to the mouth of the bladder and touch with your hand; and then touch with a little bit of urine; and do the same if there are many grains of sand.
If the stone is not great, ignorance is that you suspect that the patient has an excessive quantity of urine, which either causes or contributes to the swelling of the urine.
May administer an purgative before it is expelled, or perform an incision in the fracture with forceps until the stone is extracted in pieces.</end_of_turn>
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood and strengthen it.</end_of_turn> And rest upon that wound immersed in oil and wine, or in scented oil and warm water, so that the wound does not adhere.</end_of_turn
Then raise the patient on the bed and do not remove the bandage until the third day.</end_of_turn>
And when the wound has healed, bathe the area with water and oil, and take care of it with ointment diaphincicon and diabezicilin until it is healed.</end_of_turn
If there is an abscess in the wound, adhere and soften it with ointment, for if it resembles ice in the bladder, and the urine is prohibited (for this is known as the discharge of the bladder with urine), then remove the said stone from the wound and extract it, for if it remains it will cause the bladder to swell and decompose.</end_of_turn
And wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and against all spices, with what agrees with the treatment until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And cover at all times the care that you have placed on the area and adjust the medications that have been placed over the area.</end_of_turn>
If the stone is small and is in the meat of the heel, and is fixed there, and if there is retention of urine, it is customary to cure that which we have recommended before, since it is perceived to cause injury; and indeed it is said that this cure brings about the evacuation of the stone.
of a triangular shape, extracted from the heel, acute, fixed in the socket.</end_of_turn>
And take care that the heel does not hold the stone back, and that you tie that so that the stone does not return to the bladder.</end>
And insert the needle into the heel, perforating easily until the needle reaches the stone.</end_of_turn And rotate the needle on your hand over that small stone, and you will pierce the perforation of it until you have pierced that of the other side to make the urine flow freely.</end_of_turn
And place your hand over what is left of the stone from the part that was fractured, which is squeezed, and is evacuated with the urine, and the patient is healed.</end_of_turn
If this treatment does not please you for any reason that hinders it, then tie a thread to leave the stone in place, and another thread to pull out the stone.</end_of_turn And burn around the stone in that heel between two threads.</end_of_turn And extract that.</end_of_turn> And remove the thread and bind the wound with gauze, which is useful in the wound.</end_of_turn
It is not necessary to leave the thread to hold the stone in place, but only to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread to pull out the stone, for when it is withdrawn the thread will bring back the stone to its place and will heal the wound.</end_of_turn>
And for this reason when you pull out the thread, elevate the limb above that of the wound, or that the stone returns to its place, and heal the wound as we have said.</end_of_turn
Chapter 61.</end_of_turn>
On the extraction of a stone from the heel.</end_of_turn>
A stone in the heel is rarely engendered.</end_of_turn
If you see a stone in any of these, it is difficult to cure them, and is prohibited by experienced people.</end_of_turn
One of them is that the strong limb is limping.</end_of_turn
And the second one is that you do not find the limb well aware that it groans if you put anything in the physician's hand when it is cast, or if it is of the limbs that have had a marriage.</end_of_turn
The third sentence translates to: "The third is that you must not have any woman present who is not well acquainted with this art, especially the operation with my hand."
The fourth is that the place of the incision on the foot in women is far from the place of the stone, because it may cause a counter-incision, and in that there is fear.
May be if it is necessary to provoke it at this time, the hour is that you take a large woman who is well learned, and few are more prudent
May be if you do not have that one, the hour is that you take a large woman of experience, or present a matron who is well-versed in the matters of women, or a woman who has been well-taught in this art
Therefore make her present, and command her to do whatever you order, from the questioning about the stone from the beginning; for the reason is that it regards whether the woman is a virgin, the hour is that you put all that you said at the end of her and desire the stone.</start_of_turn>
Therefore if you find that one, cover her and leave her with what you said, and the hour command her to mark on that.</start_of_turn>
May be if she is not a virgin, the hour commands the matron to insert what was said into the groin of the patient and grasp the stone, since she puts her left hand on the bladder, and press that one with good understanding.</start_of_turn
Therefore if you find that one, the hour covers that gradually pull that from the orifice of the bladder to the parts below until it reaches the level of the cushion.</start_of_turn
And then mark on that impression of the heel of the patient's foot the level of the cushion of whatever part it is that has been stopped and centered the stone in that place, and do not move the patient's foot from that point.</start_of_turn
And the incision is to be slight at the beginning; and then insert the hook over that incision, and if you feel the stone, the hour adjust in the incision according to the quantity that you know the stone will be discharged from that.</start_of_turn
And you know that the species of stones are various: that some are small and large, and flat and sharp, and long and round, and have bumps.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must know what species they are of that you signify about what you wish.</start_of_turn
And if you see a flow of urine, adjust at the wetted navel for an hour until the urine is gone, and then return to your operation until the stone is discharged.</start_of_turn
And make ready all your instruments that are said in the extraction of stones in women, so that you are helped by them in your operation.</start_of_turn
And if you see a flow of urine, and you know that the expulsion of the urine is from the kidney that is incised, the hour you stop the powder on the spot and open that which is dusty and tough, and do not proceed further; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for it will strengthen the patient.</start_of_turn And take care of the wound.</start_of_turn
Therefore when the urgency of the urine has passed a few days, and the wound has healed, the hour you return to your operation until the stone is discharged.</start_of_turn

An abdominal hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sac which is left the codena of the genetia containing the fluid, and is called a sac.</start_of_turn
And many times it is in the proper pouch which nature has prepared in the part of the fluid, until it is known that there is already another fluid; and it is the codena of the genetia between the white sac which we have mentioned, and it is not water but pus.</start_of_turn
And the generation of this hernia is for excess of belly fat that happens to the genetia, because at those it infiltrates this matter, and sometimes happens by a violent blow that is made on the genetia.</start_of_turn
And this moisture has various colors, because its color is declining to orange or bloody, or even black feculent, or white liquid, and that is the best.</start_of_turn
And the signs by which you know that this accumulation of liquid is in the white sac that we mentioned, is that when it is removed it appears rounded declining slightly in length like a figure of water, and shows the genetia, because the liquid contains that throughout.</start_of_turn
If the humidity is in the proper panicle, then the latter heat will be round about the part of the fire and for this reason it is estimated that it is another fire.
If the humidity is between the crease of the thighs and the white hip, then the catarrh stops there.
And when you wish to recognize the color of the humidity, then you should spread the color of the humidity on the surface of the parts that precede; and according to what is seen in the remnants, judge what is inside
Therefore, when we come to the care of the patient, we must command the patient to be flexible if it is possible, and sometimes we must loosen the clothing of the patient
And thus rest upon the seat two cushions on any cause, and keep away the movement of the drape.
And thus sit on the left side of the patient, and command the minister to follow on the right side of the patient, who extends his arm from two fingers to the crease of the thighs and to the part of the flank of the belly
And thus take hold of the palm of your hand and split the crease of the thighs from the middle to the length within the fifth space
And the cut should be made according to the rule at an equal distance from the line that must divide the hair of the thighs, until it reaches the white hip including
And drain out the one, and observe, and keep me informed so that I do not make that incision; and your incision with which you make the incision so that it should be suspended in the middle of the fire and written clearly on the incision according to the quantity that is possible for you
And thus pierce the full belly with a wide perforation, and extract all the water
And thus separate between two layers the skin of the incision with nails, and stretch the belly outwards; and do not touch the crease of the thighs including, and make the incision in that manner that is possible for you And make the incision in its entirety or in pieces, and more especially on the lateral side, because if you do not carefully examine the incision of the patient, it is not without risk that the water will return
More if the fire proceeds from that side of the body at the time of your operation, when you have completed the incision of the belly, return that which has come out, and then adjust the two layers of the crease of the thighs with suture, and take care of that as well as the other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the fire corrupted by another disease, then command that you ligate the veins which are sore the suppliers, and extract the fire, and take care of that as we have said above
More if the water is added in two equal parts, then know that there are two hernias; therefore make the incision in that part as you have done in the other equally; and if it is in your sight that it is an operation, then make the incision indeed
And thus cleanse the wound, and enter into the sections of the skin submerged in oil or in oiled; and stop for a while another layer which you have submerged in wine and oil, and expand that over two thighs and the belly; and stop overcloths doubled and powder, and bind those over with a bandage that is made in this fashion:
and thus take two cloths and stuff them with wadding according to this likeness; and make firm the extremities where there is movement of the bone or wet wool, and attach them with a structure in the groin of the thighs, and one of the extremities preforms the buttock inside two, and the other preforms the buttock outside the fifth space, and two extremities over two toes and two extremities on two ankles, and all the structure is adjusted in the groin of the thighs.
And many physicians treat this hernia artificially with cautery in place of incision with the knife; and it is that you take a pointed cautery and insert it into that crease of the thighs, and ignite it as we have recommended until it is discovered that the white belly containing the water has been broken, and then you take the cautery in this fashion: and is assembled in Greek letter
And thus pierce that belly, and it is ignited until all the humidity is expelled.
And thus stretch the belly with nails, and drain out with nails, and drain out with pointed cautery; and make the incision as it is possible for you until you have eradicated all of it; and keep me away from the fire that the fire does not touch the skin.
He grasped that this operation is more dangerous and lengthy than an incision, and better left alone.
Indeed, if you are hesitant to perform an incision in the heat of battle or at the moment of cautery, or if there is a flow of blood, know that you must take care of any anomaly that may arise to you, as is customary in such cases.</end_of_turn>
Although the patient is poor and does not expect a second operation due to its horror, know that you must perform an incision as I have recommended previously; and it is confirmed that you must do so, for this is what we have said about the significance of this hernia.</end_of_turn
Know that you must make the patient lie down on any elevated surface, then make the incision in the lower part of the limb at the side of the foot, and stop the incision according to the length of the body.</end_of_turn>
And let the incision be wide enough to drain out all the fluid.</end_of_turn
And place your hand over the area and tie off the one and leave the other, so that the fluid remains within.</end_of_turn And care for the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Indeed, if an anomaly occurs during the draining of the fluid in that moment you must perform an incision: and this is not useful except when the white pus in the wound makes an anomaly and hinders the flow of blood; in this case you must either remove the pus from the wound with a pin or adjust the pressure of the wound with a small instrument.</end_of_turn
Know that the fluid will return, and this should be allowed to happen in about six months or in the spring; and when it has returned, perform the incision once more in the same manner as before, for the patient will then be free of pain for several days.</end_of_turn

Section on carbuncular hernia and its treatment.</end_of_turn>
Know that in the section on this hernia there is fear of loss of sensation in the great limbs; for I have seen the diminution of them and their saving for the better.</end_of_turn
And I remember the operation for this and the types of cautery.</end_of_turn
Therefore, I say that the cautery arises in the parts where the tendons are composed and is useful for many causes: or for acute excessive swelling, which is spread over the tendons, or for percussion.</end_of_turn
The color of the cautery is according to the color of the limb, and is not found in the pain, and is difficult cautery.</end_of_turn
And the soft cautery is bluish, from which the color is dark, and is not harmful to it.</end_of_turn
And many doctors find it useful for the nodulation of the arteries, and for inflammation of those as well as when it is already perceived, or for the inflammation of veins.</end_of_turn
Indeed, that which is for the inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the cautery when you compress that at the joints mentioned; and it is not to be touched.</end_of_turn
And that which is useful for the inflammation of veins is not dispersed by any cause except compression at those mentioned.</end_of_turn
And it is possible that concerning this kind there is utility of incision and on the others meats; that you insert the needle of the genetius and then stretch the skin to the lower parts, and extract that from the white fat, and release the blood vessels, and ligate them, and insert more of the thread than you extract from the whole part of the limb.</end>
Therefore, if the limb is already hardened in those carnitous matters, then you must extract the limb and insert it again.</end_of_turn
And if there is adhesion between any cause of the fat, or between those that are between the vessels, then you must remove all that adhesion and insert again that by incision.</end_of_turn
Indeed, if there is a birth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then you must insert all that is of it, and extract the limb as we have said.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when your operation is complete, fill the wound with soft wool soaked in olive oil and wine; and take care of it as with the other care until it is healed.</end_of_turn

From the care of hernia which is of vital importance.
It is a swelling surrounded by any covering resembling a sprout with a softening of the testicles, and it is difficult for the patient to exercise and walk due to the disease.</end_of_turn>
And in the treatment of this disease is to fear what precedes the memory.</end_of_turn
However say we must do the operation when the first sign appears.</end_of_turn>
I say that you should make the patient lie on a raised cushion; and that you suspend the testicles to the lower parts; and that you take hold of the genitals with your thighs which are proved to the groin; and that you have the other assistants that you wish, and extend those with a violent extension.</end_of_turn
And then you make an incision on the outer side of the ankle with a sharp knife to cut through the vessels until they are discovered.</end_of_turn
And then evacuate all the parts as we have said in the extraction of the intestines which are in the temples.</end_of_turn
And then leave in that place a needle which is faithful to the double, and tie one at the first place of the area where you made the incision, and tie the other end at the back of them.</end_of_turn And then you make an incision in the middle of the limb for a broad cut according to the length of the body, and extract whatever is added of the foul and corrupt humors.</end_of_turn
And then care for the wound with the care of the other wounds in which you wish to generate so that the vessels which support one of the two testicles do not go dry, which is not harmful in this case.</end_of_turn
Indeed if the veins should all be cut, it is necessary that the testicles be extracted or that they be tied up so that they are separated from the vessels, because it is private of all nourishment for the wound of the vessels, and that they are established, or that they be brought together so that they are not harmful to those.</end_of_turn
End of treatise.</end_of_turn>
The care of intestinal hernia.
The cause of this hernia is a section that extends from the navel to the lower part of the abdomen, because due to that rupture the bowel of that break is added to the other bowels.</end_of_turn
And this rupture can be either from the cicatrix or from the excess of the intestines, and this hernia occurs due to various causes: or percussion, or coughing, or straining, or elevation of any kind, or by any other means.</end_of_turn
The sign of this is that when it is due to the extension of the abdomen, it does not occur suddenly, but gradually over a long period of time, and the swelling is gradual and does not disappear, and the abdomen compresses the bowel.</end_of_turn
The sign of this is that when it is due to the section of the abdomen, it immediately causes severe pain; and that the swelling appears outside the navel and towards the flanks of the abdomen, and that the bowel is displaced towards the flanks of the abdomen.</end_of_turn
And many times it is forgotten in the bowels the fabric, and this hernia is called intestinal hernia.</end_of_turn
And many times it is useful with winds, and many times it runs in the bowels through a wound, and here it is retained, and it is in this that great pain of the disease arises, and many times it causes great pain and more when it is pressed.</end_of_turn
And in the treatment of these diseases of this disease there is fear, because it is necessary to avoid the treatment in that case.</end_of_turn
The way of operating for this is that you command the patient to reduce the abdomen with his hand to the bottom of his curvature if he obeys your command, and that you place a cushion over his belly between your thighs, and elevate the legs of the patient.</end_of_turn
And then you grasp the testicles with the thumb and index finger of your hand, and make an incision through the entire length; and then fix at two points the edges of the incision as you wish to open the incision with those.</end_of_turn
And if the incision is as much as you are able to do, that from that there may be some forgotten liquid.</end_of_turn
And then evacuate that bloody fluid which is left from the incision of the testicles, until the white tough membrane of some part is discovered.</end_of_turn
The testicles are between the white testicles, which is where the codena of the urine resides, and between the second testicle, and it relieves that adhesion which is at the back of the testicle.
Then remove the bladder from the testicles and bring the white testicles closer to the left hand, and extend the testicle towards the section; command the minister to extend the urine towards the outside and you will dissolve the adhesion that is behind the solution done.</end_of_turn>
And be sure that there is no cause for the intestines being covered in the white testicles.</end_of_turn> Even if you find any cause, then leave it to the belly alone.</end_of_turn>
And pierce the back of the testicles to release the urine that is in the sack as we have recommended previously.</end_of_turn
And administer an ointment composed of lard submerged in oil, and apply it to the wound; administer the thread that we have recommended (since several veins of the white testicles are cauterized, which we have mentioned above in relation to the fear of the flow of urine, because several veins are burnt out).
If the case is delayed, let cold water be poured, and keep it on until it falls as we have mentioned.</end_of_turn>
And take care of the wound with the other care of wounds until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter LXVI.</end_of_turn>
Of pulmonary hernia.</end_of_turn
In this hernia nothing has been observed that could be useful in its treatment.</end_of_turn
First say that it is useful in this hernia as we have recommended in the hernia of the bladder; that is, you tie the vessels near the section above where the urine comes out; and dry the area around the abscess in order to remove it with the urine until the vessels fall down.</end_of_turn
Take care of the wound as we have said until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter LXVII.</end_of_turn
Of the dislocation that is useful in the groin.</end_of_turn
Several veins must break in the groin as we have said, and examine the area.</end_of_turn
And do not suspect any cause of the abscesses in the groin; and if you suspect, it is little; return immediately in all hours.</end_of_turn
Even if it is prolonged, adjust a fissure in the bladder so that the abscess comes out of the bladder; this is what causes the extension of the bladder, which is what we have mentioned above in relation to the fear of the flow of urine, because the bladder is stretched and the area is exposed.
And the care for it is like that which precedes the narration.</end_of_turn
And several veins are cured with iron according to this manner: the patient sits on the seat between your thighs, and you dry the area of the rupture of the abscesses by cutting around the circumference according to the width of three fingers.</end_of_turn
And tighten the white testicles that are under the urine sac until they are uncovered.</end_of_turn
And take the thread and keep it on the prominent part of the bladder, and press that to the navel.</end_of_turn
And now draw up the two limbs that are prominent at the end of the radius, and suture one to the other.
And now draw up the limb at the end of the radius, without introducing any fat from the cicatrix, neither extend the gut, nor cause any other way as I will tell you in the treatment of intestinal hernia.</end_of_turn>
And now care for the wound as in the treatment of boils, and when incisions are made, soften that and restore the boil until it is consolidated; for the fat is contracted and the swelling is not adjusted.</end_of_turn
It is better in this place, for it is more likely to be healthy.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 68.</end_of_turn>
Of the softening of the testicles' cord.</end_of_turn>
The veins that go through the testicles' cord are softened by means of albus, for the meats that are between them are softened, and it is enough for them.</end_of_turn
When it is necessary in the treatment of these it is done in such a way that the patient lies down two fingers, and cut through the entire cord that is softened above the natural cord; and that the two lips be adjusted at the suture.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, when you begin to soften the cord with three or four incisions and a firm suture.</end_of_turn
And now make incisions between the sutures; and care for the other wounds until they are healed and the incisions have fallen off.</end_of_turn
Chapter 69.</end_of_turn
Of castration.</end_of_turn
It is known to me that castration is forbidden in our laws, however, I recall it from this book; and it is not necessary to recall it except for two cases, of which the one is that the physician should know how to care for it when asked about it, since he knows the cure for it; and the other case is that we must sometimes castrate other animals for our young, such as mares, and sows, and goats, and pigs, as well as other animals that resemble them.</end_of_turn
And therefore I say that castration is useful in two ways: either by traction or by incision.</end_of_turn
As for traction, the way is to keep the animal in cold water until the testicles are softened and limp and hanging.</end_of_turn And then take hold of them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear to touch each other.</end_of_turn
As for castration that is useful by incision and section, hold the animal and grasp the testicles with your left hand.</end_of_turn
And then ligate the surgeon, and make an incision over each vein with a section that two veins protrude.</end_of_turn
And now make incisions of the rest that appear to be ruptured.</end_of_turn Do not worry about those of the cicatrix of any kind, but about the fat that is above the veins.</end_of_turn
And this method of castration is better than the traction method, for traction often leaves any cause of the testicles so that the animal desires to bite.</end_of_turn
And care for the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter 70.</end_of_turn
Of the care of hermaphroditism.</end_of_turn
Hermaphroditism in men is in two ways: when it appears that the space between the testicles has been split in two in which there is a space in which there are two testicles with a female organ between them.</end_of_turn
And sometimes the testicles secrete urine in the space between them.</end_of_turn
And in women it is a kind: and that is that the female organ that is on the fifth part is like two testicles of a man a little less and somewhat broader at the root than in a man.</end_of_turn
And the care is of three kinds: two of the men and one of the women.</end_of_turn The wound covers the parts that are swollen inwards, and they must be cured with the care of the other plagues.
In the second sort of men who urinate in the groin, where the testicles are, neither cure nor operation is for them
(The text ends here.)
From languor and prominent flesh because of the women.
A strong languor is adjusted on natural causes so that it is stretched and is felt in the legs; and in many women some veins are increased in size just as in men and even during sexual intercourse
Then cover that the excess of languor has with your hand or thumb and insert it
Do not delay in incision, especially in the groin, so that the flow of blood does not diminish
And take care of that which must be cured so that it is healed.
More flesh is born than is seen in the horror of the mother than fills that which is born; and strong flesh is cast out to the other parts following the custom (and for that reason they call the first “disease caused by excess”); therefore cover that just as we insert the languor, so do we take it out when it is cured
(The text ends here.)
On the care of rats
The rat is one whose wound of the female is not perforated, or has a small hole It is either natural or accidental
Accidental is for an illness that has preceded it, and that is caused by no flesh being adjusted or by a slippery or thick fluid
It is caused in the groin of the mother, or in the flanks, or in the belly of the wound, or in the bottom of the wound, and it prevents biting, swelling and inflammation, and strong flesh prevents menstruation
And the knowledge of that is useful for regarding the womb, if the swelling is apparent, it is enough; even if it is not apparent, when you touch those who say it or see it
Even if the swelling is slippery and like mucus, and is in the two lips, when you touch it and break it
Then rest over the two lips of the wound, and when you touch them indicate that there are pus there
And the woman is over the two thighs, the thighs are wide apart, and extend the two lips with force until that slippery mucus is broken and the swelling is opened
And take sponges and dip them in oil and place them over the area, and keep your hand over the wound so that the wound does not harden.
Even if the mucus is thick and sticky, when you insert your finger you must cover it with butter or lint from myrtle
Even if the swelling is for flesh, when you insert your thumb, then insert your finger as well
And if you have the medicines that stop the flow of blood, even as aconite, and bloodroot, and henbane, adjusted with an egg white
And give a wide needle of lead so that the wound is not permanently hardened.
Keep it for several days and apply a dry cloth.
And take care of the wound with the other care of consolidation until it is healed
And many times the wounds that occur in the mother do not give birth to other flesh, and when you insert according to this method. And if there is a fistula in the groin, the fistula in the groin is not to be treated contrary to the custom in any way
(The text ends here.)
On the care of hemorrhoids, tailbone and red swelling that occur in the knowledge of women
Hemorrhoids are appreciated from the orifices of the veins rather than from the veins themselves because they cause continuous bleeding; and when they are ancient they are called theyls
And I have already said in the division of those that I have mentioned and their signs, and I say that those who receive care and those who do not receive care
Therefore I say that today and always when it is in the groin and does not appear to the patient, the hour in which it does not cause pain is not a harmful cure for it.
Those which are in the groin about which he complains are those which are cured.</end_of_turn>
And cover that you put the hand of the patient firmly on the thigh and then extend the thumb against the nails, or against the hair, and prick those against the root.</end_of_turn>
And then powder over those that you have just incised with the juice of one of the veins incisions, thus as in an abscess and resembling those.</end_of_turn
And then keep the feet covered for an hour, and then stop in cold water.</end_of_turn
And if the juice persists, the hour in which it will be in decoction of mustard and of scabs of millet and of pus and of resemblance.</end_of_turn
And then take barley food and comfort that with honey and vinegar and make a plaster with water over two of them.</end_of_turn>
And if the juice is evacuated, it is well; otherwise, adhere to two winds, and to the nipples is sacrifice.</end_of_turn>
And then take broth and immerse that in the juice of cocksfoot or in the juice of rue or in the juice of ivy with a little wine and adhere to the area; and care for the area until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
Chapter 164.</end_of_turn>
Of puncture of an abscess in the groin.</end_of_turn>
Many species of abscesses occur accidentally in the groin, thus as cancer and abscess lapident and ulcerous and bulging and carbuncles and fistulas hemorrhoidal and raguarias and swellings and other abscesses.</end_of_turn And I have already said these diseases and their species and their symptoms, and their treatments in the division.</end_of_turn
And I say in this treatise of the abscess of the groin when it comes from the abscesses that accompany healing, and if you want to know how to make the operation of them with iron.</end_of_turn
Therefore consider whether the groin pain at the beginning is acute with percussion and swelling and fever, and sometimes when it subsides and when you touch that it does not cause pain, the hour does not suffice for the perforation of it, and care for that which helps on the maturation until the acute of the accident subsides.</end_of_turn
And the hour covers that you make the hand rest on a cushion which has two cushions; recline on the groin two and adjust the feet of the patient below the belly, and the thighs are spread out, and keep the knees bent, and tie whatever is convenient to the water.</end_of_turn
And then the midwife follows behind the doctor and administer the instrument with which the opening of the groin is made, the form of which will come in those causes that make it necessary.</end_of_turn
And it covers when you want to administer this instrument that you stay with the hand of the patient in the groin of the woman, and what comes out of the instrument inside the groin is not more than the groin and leads to the disease.</end_of_turn More if the instrument is greater than the groin, the hour covers that you powder over the texture of the groin so that the insertion of any instrument into the groin is prohibited.</end_of_turn
And it covers that you stop the vomiting that runs in the instrument of the doctor as soon as he has taken hold of the instrument and rotated the vomiting until the opening of the groin is made.</end_of_turn
And when the discharge comes, and is grasped with the hand and is lion and bloody, the hour covers that you wash that with a sponge sponge.</end_of_turn
And when the healing is evacuated, the hour covers that you keep in the wound a compress soaked in olive oil or green oil in which there is any stiffness; and keep the bandage on the section in the groin.</end_of_turn
And keep for a while the groin and on the wound clean cotton soaked in water in which are boiled mallows.</end_of_turn
And so it should be cured within two days at most, when it agrees with the latter that it will be healed when it is whole again.
And so it should be bathed with wine vinegar and salt, and so with wine in which there is boiled licorice or long pepper, and so return to the present.</end_of_turn>
And if the plague is deeply rooted in the foot, then you must abstain from its treatment with fire, having treated that which we have said in the division.
Chapter 165.</end_of_turn>
To teach the mothers how to manage their lives so that they can be treated as doctors when they are away from home according to an unnatural figure.</end_of_turn>
A necessary cause is that the mistress should know at the beginning the natural figure of childbirth for her daughters, because when she sees the woman express at the breasts and desire to smell the air, and about that is relieved by that which is over her, she considers that this part is naturally in figure, and that is the spitting of her over the navel, and the second one is that of those who are hanging or suspended or pending from the navel.</end_of_turn
Therefore, when you see those signs, you must compress the belly so that the embryo is delivered slightly before its head comes out, and this is called the expulsion of those superfluities with good management.</end_of_turn
The part that is not natural and unusable is when the embryo is delivered over the feet and the body of the fetus is delivered before the head of the fetus and the feet of the fetus are up, and the hand of the mistress or at the foot of the mistress.</end_of_turn Or it is delivered over the head and the hand of the mistress or at the belly of the mistress, and it is greatly converted over the navel, and it is like the figures that are not usable.</end_of_turn
A necessary cause is for the mistress to be learned and prudent in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.</end_of_turn
And I have shown you all the figures of these things, and what is their meaning so that you understand what is significant and what has been omitted.</end_of_turn>
When the fetus is delivered head first through a natural exit, and that is vehement over the woman and is useful to her, sometimes the virtue of the mistress is already diminished, then you must do what the women have, and expel with cinnamon and aromatic oils.</end_of_turn
And so insert the mistress between the thighs and say little space and open that which is at the second part, or cut that which is at the navel until it comes out what is in it of humidity.</end_of_turn And press the belly of the woman until it is delivered.</end_of_turn
If it does not come out, you must cover that the woman is moistened with mucus of peas and mucus of cinnamon with cinnamon seeds.</end_of_turn
And so command her, so that she be compressed and make her vomit with food; and cover her mouth and nose for an hour, because the fetus will be forgotten for a long time.</end_of_turn
And if two-thirds of the fetus are forgotten at the beginning, you must reduce them gradually.</end_of_turn If she does not obey the command, you must place the woman on a cushion and lift her legs up, and so support the cushion on the ground; and the woman must be held so that she does not fall from the shock.</end_of_turn
If two-thirds of them are not expelled, and the fetus dies, you must extract them and remove the fetus from the belly or tie the body to her hand and extract that as well, because that which is forgotten will be forgotten.</end_of_turn>
When the fetus comes out on the thighs, you must press those down towards the navel, and so make the fetus small, and so that it engulfs that, and that you grasp a leg of it and extend those little by little.</end_of_turn
When they are inside the belly, you must command her to vomit, and make her vomit with food, because if God wills it, it will be forgotten.</end_of_turn
And if it is not forgotten in what we have recounted, you must return the fetus little by little until you reach that natural figure, because that which is forgotten will be forgotten in haste.</end_of_turn
If it is forbidden to do all that we have recommended, then take a high dose of musellage of altea and gum dissolved, and prick all over the bone for a good percussion, and then gently draw out the pus from the belly of the patient. Then do what is necessary to make the patient vomit, until you see the stones pass out.
And when sometimes the parts become softened, then make them undergo fumigation with myrrh and pause it for them And when the fumigation has lasted for an hour, then make the patient cough and expel the mucus from their mouth, remove the hand, and press the lower part of the patient's belly with a gentle compression, so that it becomes soft again
Thus the lateral extent of the patient's mas lasts until one of the mas has gone out.<end_turn> Thus learn to reduce the hand of the patient, even if you cannot reduce it, then elevate the heel and keep it from going away.</start_turn>
If it does not go away, then make the patient lie down on the genitals, and with your thumbs press the patient's genitals vigorously, and give them liament and recommend mucilages.</start_turn><end_turn>
If it is urgent that he gives birth, then make the patient cough, and study how to reduce the hand, and gently restore the patient's belly to its natural position, and command the heel to expel and order the patient to breathe deeply until he is soft again.</start_turn><end_turn
Thus about the patient's thigh when it is expanded, the mas and the fascia of the thigh are at two extremes of their greatest extent. When the midwife has the patient's hand and gently turns the little one by little, this will facilitate it.</start_turn><end_turn>
And when it is thus and when it has been softened, and when the hand has been paused over the patient's heel where we recommended oil and mucilages.</start_turn><end_turn
Then command the patient's hand to rise little by little, and when it has finished, make the patient cough and order the heel to be flexed forward, and command the patient to be compressed; and make the patient expel slowly.</start_turn><end_turn The fetus is ready to be born from the wide side.</start_turn><end_turn
When you must be afraid of the mother according to this manner, consider it, and when you have grasped the second one with your finger until it is evacuated from the moisture.</start_turn><end_turn
And if the patient's fetus is hanging over the face and the heel, then you must grasp that of the navel, so that it is not retained and remains.</start_turn><end_turn
And thus pull out the fetus from the parts downwards until it pauses when it covers, and command the heel to breathe deeply, and the patient will be cured immediately if God wills it.</start_turn><end_turn
The birth of twins or many fetuses at once.</start_turn><end_turn It is known that when twins are conceived in the same womb, three or four of them sometimes arise, which is strange and usually does not survive; for such things are beyond the power of nature.</start_turn><end_turn
And this is what is said of them, whether they are twins or more, when they are separated by the navel cord of each one of them, they are delivered whole as if it were a single fetus by natural instinct, and there are some who say that there are several veguadas at the same time, and that is not to be believed as it is not natural.</start_turn><end_turn
If they are difficult to move, encourage them forcefully and bring them to the point where we mentioned the unnatural figures, for in that case you will care for them in the same way as we have recounted.
If the mistress understands and makes it easier and clearer, and arrives on time, and is ingenious according to the entire figure as she has been prepared for the imminent danger to health
Remember that which is formed in the womb from the embryos and is aborted.
Some doctors consider that a woman in her sixth month of pregnancy has six vergers, and another doctor claims that there are ten vergers in total, which causes pain by measurement of the glorious physicians.</end_of_turn>
And thus it is necessary for the mistress to know firmly what is like that small thing, and therefore order that she should not touch it.</start_of_turn>
Chapter 166.</start_of_turn>
Of the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.</start_of_turn>
When you cure the dead fetus as we have said in the division of medicine and it is not outside, you must certainly use an operation with your hand, for you must consider whether the woman is of sound virtue and is not among those for whom there is fear of loss on account of the things for which she is feared.</start_of_turn
You must cover the woman over the thighs over the seat, and her head should be inclined downwards and her buttocks raised.</start_of_turn
And the assistant has that part or is bound in the thigh so that the body does not extend beyond the extraction of the fetus.</start_of_turn
And moisten the mouth of the mistress with oil of almonds and mucus of aloe and of rue and of sesame seed.</start_of_turn
And put on the mistress your hand with those oils and mucilages, and interlace your hand in the palm, and seek with your hand in the place where the nails are in the fetus.</start_of_turn
And place it conveniently in that place where you consider whether the fetus is ready that it should be delivered over the head, and when you have left the nails in the heel of the foot, or in the ankle, or in the mouth, or in the palate, or you leave the beard, or in the fork of the tongue, or in the proper places of the ribs, or leave the hip bones.</start_of_turn
If delivery is made on the feet of the fetus, however, in the fifth month or in the middle of the ribs.</start_of_turn
And keep the nail with the left hand, and suspend the curvature of the limb in that place which is between the thumb and the little finger, and interlace your hand to facilitate and keep the nail in some of those places that we have mentioned until the cause of expulsion appears.</start_of_turn
And order to pause and remain in the position of the limb a third if necessary, so that it is equal traction and not extension only according to its rule.</start_of_turn
And so be gentle in all parts, so that the expulsion of the limb is alleviated as much as is done in the teeth despite the eradication of the fetus.</start_of_turn
And cover in them what is between them that the extension should be softened; and if any part of them is retained, order that the mistress put on some of those nails with oil and interlace those expected and roll over those that are retained.</start_of_turn
Therefore if the limb of the fetus is expelled, leave the nails exchanged among those that are most outward; and do this until the whole fetus is expelled.</start_of_turn
And if the hand is expelled before the other, and it is not possible to reduce that because of the magnitude of the limb, order that it be covered with a bandage over that; and extract that until the whole is expelled, and cut that either in the wrist or in the elbow.</start_of_turn
And so cover the other hand and the two feet.</start_of_turn
And if the head of the fetus is large, or if it is injured by its coarseness in the expulsion, or if there is water adjusted in the head, order that you interlace between the teeth a sponge and split the head and extract the water, or that you break that with a tool which is called “alundat”, the shape of which will be like the shape of the other instruments in the chapter which is adjacent to this.</start_of_turn
It is evident that the disease causes great suffering for nature: and that therefore we must instill that medicine which will both nourish and expel that which has been said; and to this end we must extract the bones with forceps.
If the head is swollen and constricted, break the spur of the heel; for when the humidity in the feet is evacuated, it will be expelled
May it not be complicated, neither does it obey this; for you must instill the head as much as possible according to your skill
And if the belly is swollen with fluid or is in hydrops, you must break that which runs out as soon as the humidity that is in it is evacuated
If the foot is over the knee, the traction of the limb is light and the direction of the limb towards the major opening is light
If it is constricted, break the abdomen and the heel; for you must extract that which has infiltrated your hand, and that you break the abdomen and the heel until the fluid that is in them runs out
If the other limbs are remaining and the head is back, put your left hand inside; if the mouth of the limb is gaping, put your hand in the armpit, and grasp the head, and draw that which is said towards the mouth of the limb, and at the same time bring in one or two fingers, and draw them out again.
If the mouth of the limb is closed by swelling, do not press too hard on it; because it will cause the evacuation of fatty humors. It is necessary to administer an emollient. Administer plasters; and keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
If the foot is close to the knee, if possible, is to make an incision: and to administer what has been said concerning the foot seen
If that is not possible, the hours are to make an incision in pieces, and to extract it
And do not leave any cause of the second kind behind.
When you have completed all your operation, administer what has been said concerning the care of the wound which has occurred in the limb.
And if there is discharge of pus, let it drain in styptic waters and administer the other care
And indeed I have seen a woman in the belly of whom was a dead fetus, and thereupon I made another incision, and the other fetus was dead. It happens that long time has passed after the incision in the navel; and when it is opened, it is found to be filled with blood, and it begins to swell.
And I was called to care for it, and I treated it for a long time, but the plague did not consolidate
Then I found out some strong plaster of attraction, and I extracted one bone, and I passed four days, and I extracted another bone; and I was amazed that in the belly was no bone
And then I thought that they were the bones of the dead fetus
Therefore I left the plague, and I extracted from it five bones, the woman exists in the thousands with her milt in her thighs, and I have seen in such a manner for a long time, correct from her a little mark of the hand
And I did not cease to be astonished, but that in this is science and a helper that the physician has at his hand for the administration of care.
Of the forms of the instruments which are necessary to extract the fetus
The way in which the limb is opened.
This is the way in which the bone is grasped in which two cuts are made at the two extremities of two fingers The incision must be made with great caution, and must be made with a pointed cautery or with a needle or with a boy's fist
And the width of each palm is as two fingers and the margin of each with one finger; and the length of each is one palm and a half; and in the middle place of two fingers there are two adjustments of that middle finger which are already fixed, of which the length is the half of a palm and a little more, and the width of each is as two fingers, or a little more
These two additional things are introduced into the mouth of the mother when it is opened with those two prescriptions which you have given for the vertigo.
Another form that is similar to that of that pus which is subtle and light:
It may be made from dust of ivy or from barley, according to the form of forceps. May, however, at the end of them, there are two such additional things which are sometimes added, and the length of these additional things is like a palm, and the width of each is two fingers wide
And when you wish to open the mouth of the mother, then do make the woman lie down with her feet hanging down, open what is between her thighs. And then open your hand like a pair of forceps according to the quantity that you wish of the opening of the mouth of the mother until the matrix makes so that you want it
The form of vertigo which they call the ancient one:
A form of pressing which is made on the part where the fet is pressed
A form of friendship which is made on the part where the great head is contained
And it is like forceps in which teeth are at the end, sometimes like that, and sometimes it is like tweezers in which teeth are like those of a saw which are inserted and contain it. A form of slight pressing
A form of unity having a thorn: this is what is called vertigo which is caused by these humors which we have mentioned previously.
A form of unity having two thorns: this is what is called the vertigo of the ancients which is caused by these humors which we have mentioned previously
A form of spatula having two extremities with which the head is broken off: this is what is called vertigo of the ancients which is caused by these humors which we have mentioned previously
A form of two spatulas which are wide: this is what is called the vertigo of the ancients which is caused by these humors which we have mentioned previously
All these instruments are exercises, and when they are multiplied with the species of that, and when they are prepared, you must take an artificer, for the more curious you are about your operation and the more numerous you are, the more you must take care of the people for their quantity
And do not work with these instruments, neither do you must take them, for the necessity of these is not excusable.
From the extraction of the second toe.
When the second toe is retained you must support it, and command the patient to hold the heel away, and then do order that one should push out with the thumb, and strengthen your hand over the mouth and over the nails, and if in doing so the intestine comes out, it is not good
And if not, then take an elixir and perforate the cover with a needle and stop in that herb which opens the mouth of the mother, like balm and rue and ivy and chamomile and saffron and asafoetida and rue martagon and hyssop All these herbs or some of them are immersed in water in the elixir, and stop that on the fire.
And then put in a cannula of ivy in the mouth of the mother, and keep that inside until the vapor comes out to the cavity of the mother.
And then do order that one should push out as we have said, and the second toe will be removed quickly.
And if you remain near this care and it does not come out, then command the matron to immerse her left hand in olive oil or in almond milk, and then put that in the heel and press with that until the second toe has been found, and when that has been found, then take hold of that and gradually pull it out as much as possible so that the mother does not suffer from excessive traction. It is necessary that it should be reversed towards the right and left side with facility
And if the mouth of the mother is closed, as we have already recommended the care with turning and with the elixir with herbs
However, if it is not removed by all the causes which we have recommended, then you must keep in mind that no fatigue should be made in the extraction, for what comes out of it to the mouth of the mother lies in the space of the thigh, and then crystallize that in that way and apply tetraherba; for that will make that it does not stick to that for several days and that it will be dissolved and will be removed
When the patient is poor, he has a foul breath, and a bad smell in his stomach; and this leads to the disease. Then cover that he receives sub-fumigious medicines and appropriate things for him.
Indeed, the ancients already used sub-fumigation with salt and dry herbs
A means of an instrument with which the female is sub-fumigated due to the retention of menses and the second [menstrual] day:
Either see or feel.
And suspend the limb slender in the groin and the limb wide on the fire, and suspend the sub-fumigation on the sleeves of the fire
And keep that within which sub-fumigation is consumed and repeat it later
Take care of the buttocks of the unperforated child
The boy cries and their buttocks are not pierced, which already irritate the slender ones and oppress them Then cover the midwife that she pierce with that said knife; and if not, pierce with that sharp needle, and keep guard that it does not touch the liver.
Then place over that cloth soaked in wine and oil; and keep him warm until he is satisfied.
Indeed, if you fear that he is oppressed, when you pause in the bath insert a tube for a few days, and keep it until the child wants to defecate
And indeed the oppression of the buttocks is caused by the consolidation of plague or fistula; then cover that this consolidation is not injured, and keep it cured with the care and the plaster that we mentioned before.
Treatment of fistulas that arise from the buttocks
The fistulas that arise in the lower part of the buttocks are nodular and bulky, which arise from the buttock bone or in the space of the two buttock bones
It is a fistula or tumor
And when that nodule is old and corrupted by the white or yellow moist humors, and some veins are penetrated by these fistulas
And those that penetrate are recognized by that which comes out of them through the passage and by the wind; and some physicians use the disease of egressio, and many other strong people are ejected from them by force
And these fistulas sometimes penetrate into the bladder, and into the meat of the heel; and sometimes they penetrate into the hip joint and into the bone of the thigh
And it is known that the penetrating fistula that enters the buttock and not penetrating is that you put your finger on the buttock and, when you do not see it, try to remove the bone or the flesh from the fistula when it is swollen
Indeed, if there is swelling, then enter into that attempt to plaster or bandage around that finger that you put on the buttock, until you sit on the finger or put it on the buttock
And if neither sitting nor any other cause of egestion nor vomit nor wind comes from the bath, as we have said, then indeed it is not penetrating, and you should proceed with the treatment
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the meat of the heel, the significance of it is that it is urine from that which it comes, and prohibition of that until the area is consolidated with medical treatment
Indeed, if it penetrates into the hip joint or into the bone and causes pain in the circumference, the sign of it is that the finger has passed through here if it is not swollen in the bone, and pain in the circumference of the part; and that it is softened in all its parts; and that it is not of any use in that treatment, nor is it consolidated with medicine
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no cure for all of them, and the cure for them is the work and uselessness of the doctors concerning which we have spoken.
Indeed, in that one that is not penetrating and is not old, a cure with iron is expected as I have told you to recommend, and that which I have already mentioned and practiced.</start_of_turn>
And it is that the disease has come between your hands on the two buttocks and you elevate the legs of the patient into your arms, the thighs are inclined towards the belly of the patient, and you put a finger on the plaster, or on the flesh if there is swelling in the fistula, until you see that the finger has passed through the fistula.
If she groans in pain around the belly, know that her bowels have become inflamed.
If she sits on the thumb, she has already discovered that something is penetrating; or if she sits between the thumb and the index finger or the index finger and the ring finger, then it is certainly penetrating; do not work on that, for it is not in that place that the remedy is to be sought, just as we have said.</end_of_turn>
But I say to you that this is not a healthy man in this house.</end_of_turn>
And for the medicine for which there is hope of benefit in them is that you burn a pointed cautery subtly according to the size of the fistula, as it is said before, and introduce that flame into the fistula until it reaches around the belly; and then repeat that twice or thrice until you know that all those inflamed tissues that seemed like feathers of a sparrow have been absorbed.</end_of_turn
And take care that the clothes wrapped around the belly are removed so that all those tissues that have been absorbed are removed, and take care that the medicine that causes inflammation and consolidation is applied, and if it is healed, well and good; but if not, it is not healed at any other time by any other treatment.</end_of_turn
If the thumb enters and does not penetrate inside the thumb, which is at the hip, and between that and the thumb which is very well known for its flesh or for its fat, and sometimes the fistula comes out on the surface of the heel, then dry the heel from the beginning of the fistula, and see that the thumb is dry, and that the fistula is empty until the edge of the thumb reaches the point where the extremity of the thumb was, and the thumb is freed and discharged.</end_of_turn
And finally remove those inflamed tissues which are like feathers of a sparrow and do not remain from any other cause.</end_of_turn>
But if there is discharge of pus sometimes that comes between you and your operation when you burn those tissues, know that it is better that you burn the fire or acute medicine, because the burn of the fire adjusts well to these good tissues: this is the treatment of those tissues that have been adjusted, and the excision of the pus excess of humidity.</end_of_turn
And take care that the clothes wrapped around the border or in the cause of distress are removed until the limb gets tight, and take care that the time the wound is left open is when the flesh is hard and inflamed.</end_of_turn
And these medicines in which there is stypticism and excision; when the time is restored, it is already healed and you do not fear repetition.</end_of_turn
But if the fistula has already gone inside the groin and is elongated from its surface of the body, then enter the thumb in the groin and inquire about that.</end_of_turn
And therefore if you are certain that the thumb and between you and it is very well known for its fat or for its flesh, and that it is likely to penetrate, then it is not an operation in them but according to the way of faith and hope.</end_of_turn
The cause of this is to administer in them one of three ways: either that you burn it as we have said; or that you extract it so that you can achieve the concavity of the limb so that you can easily insert the fingers and the cure will proceed; do not proceed with the incision except for the purpose of removing the lacteals that contain the belly, and that you order the patient to rest and abstain from any voluntary movement; or that you lengthen the thumb and say that pus that you dry from inside the groin is extracted from there; as we have said, or with the thumb or another sharp instrument, and that you modify those inflamed tissues which are in the incision so that they are not left crusting over; and that you try to restore the entire wound with the incision, and if the discharge of pus does not consolidate, and the fistula remains open in the groin, and if there is still pus left in the wound, do not fear for the patient.</end_of_turn> And sometimes the fistula is finished in this way: when you insert the thumb into the fistula, and it is at the groin around the surface of the body at the heel and in the margin of the groin, the thumb tries to perforate the extremity, which is just as if you were preparing the skin in this way:
... and insert the thumb into that fold of fat or around those; and then insert the thumb firmly into the fistula until you achieve the concavity of the limb.</end_of_turn
But if it penetrates in the margin of the groin it is better to extract the fat from that hole while you insert the thumb in the groin; extract the limb of the fat and adjust the two limbs well, and rest each one, and keep it quiet for a day or two, and when the thumb has subsided from the flesh, open the wound again until those tissues that were between the two extremities of the thumb have subsided.
And quickly treat the plague while it is still fresh and healing.
Even if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, it is necessary to penetrate nevertheless, in whatever way you are prepared, for it is not for you to leave it unclosed, because that would cause infection; and quickly treat the plague while it is still fresh and healing.</end_of_turn>
The form of scraping that you must use to open the fistula: the curvature of which is not acute and the other part is not blunt, so that you do not cause infection, even as is sometimes the case.</end_of_turn
Suturing of wounds in which the silk runs smoothly over the incision.</end_of_turn
Wounds are of two kinds, either those that are between the buttocks like coals, or those that are like seeds of grass.</end_of_turn And these are either small or large; and they all heal from these wounds and there is one, and not many, and not too few, and neither too many.</end_of_turn
But indeed those that are outside the buttocks must be treated according to the months of little humidity, such as citrine water or a little of saffron with continuous application, and according to the color of the wound.</end_of_turn
And the care of that which is inside the wound is that you command the patient to relax and express themselves until the wound heals and the swellings disappear.</end_of_turn> Then you must hold me close and suspend your thumbs or that you hold them at your nail, and quickly apply these things to the wound.</end_of_turn
But if your thumbs do not hold them in those places because of the humidity of their moisture and softening of those things, then take them rough or rough and soft or wet with wool, extract them from the wound and quickly apply these things to the wound. Powder over them some fine ashes or dust near the incision, so that they go into those rather than leaving them outside; or cauterize them as it is said above.</end_of_turn And quickly treat these as with other treatments until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And if the buttocks do not obey evacuation, it is necessary to criticize the patient with slight biting in the place where there is little pain, and wash it with the water that is in the wound and that evacuates willingly when the patient expresses themselves.</end_of_turn
But if the wounds are outside the buttocks, the cause of them is light, and it is that you hold these things at your nail, or that you hold them with a thumb, and insert them, and quickly treat these as we have said until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And whoever desires to make an incision, cover that you administer the suture in this manner: take fine silk and enter it with a needle and quickly extract the swellings from the parts above, and make that penetrate with the needle at the root of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the silk in the place beyond the needle, and stretch the wound strongly; and quickly tie the knot and extract the needle.</end_of_turn
Do all of this, and leave them one and do not close them, so that the excess of healing may run from that.</end_of_turn
And quickly place over the buttocks some soft fat soaked in olive oil or in beeswax; and place that over the wound and command the patient to rest.</end_of_turn And quickly remove that which is outside; and when it is necessary, treat these as with ointment or another treatment until they are healed.</end_of_turn
And as they are ancient and have no value in that medicine, it is necessary to hold these things at the point of scraping or at your nail until they are moist and be host to those pus that are discharged, which prevent them from solidifying; and quickly treat these until they are solidified.</end_of_turn
And quickly keep these things in proportion more vehement than the first time until they are almost healed and are excoriated; and quickly treat these until they are healed.</end_of_turn
You must know that to lance is key, and do not notice redon according to the color of the wound resembling a cap of cauliflower, and is useful in all parts and especially in the parts below the knee and the buttocks, and because of those pains you must support them.</end_of_turn
And thus we cover that which is in the circuit of the knee, and that which is held by the nails or with a clamp, and that which is eradicated from its root; and then we care for that.
And if you wish, cauterize as follows: as is before in the head of the foot.
More than a wart is a small rough fistule round about on the surface of the body, and spots that come out like veins are seen in the feet of most children.</start_of_turn>
And their care is that you extend and inscribe that, or that you break that with a needle or with the point of a knife inside the box.</start_of_turn> And if you wish, cauterize as we have said, with fire or acute medicine.</start_of_turn
More like a flea is a small foul-smelling or fistulated large one about on the surface of the body running in the groin, and when it is cold it finds that which is cent in it like the biting of a flea, and it is beneficial around the body.</start_of_turn
And their care is that you take a needle of goose quill or of turtle quill, and that it be strong, and place that upon the flea inside which it contains the circle of the needle of the parts of it; and then turn your hand over the needle until you have inscribed that which is in the circuit of the flea, and stop that in the groin of the body, and evacuate the flea from its root.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, do that with a needle of ivory or iron in this way:
The tip of the needle should be grasped by its substance, deaf (so that it is not perforated), covered so that over the thumb the learning of the hand is obliterated and the revolution of that.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, cauterize the flea as it is said before in the cauterization of other ailments in the head of the cautery.</start_of_turn
In the manner of the instruments which are administered to give credence.</start_of_turn
Some veins are beneficial credence of silver or lead or ivory or malleable; and some veins are beneficial of those small and large instruments according to those which are administered, for whoever is administered in the care of the little children is small; and of those of whom the buttocks are frail or painful, their credence of those should be small.</start_of_turn
The form of great and little credence:</start_of_turn
The head of the needle in which the bundle is bound is wide according to this manner; and let there be a distinction at the place where the bundle is bound thus as many times.</start_of_turn
And the extremity of it that is behind, which is included in the buttocks, is deaf (so that it is not pierced) like a lion, backwards against substance; and on one of the sides of it are two veins, and on the other side one vein, and the breadth of the vein according to the greatness of the rays and the greater the small.
And let the bundle be in which the medicines of bladder of beast or of sheepskin are placed, and the root of it be a palm.</start_of_turn
And let it be pierced by four veins thus as it is revolved; and if the space that is between the veins is the thickness of the finger.</start_of_turn
And thus enter into those veins firmly with a strong thread or thread; and adjust that with that the bundle is held; and when it is placed in it the bundle is stretched in the head of the credence between two distinguished persons with strong constraint, and let you cauterize each vein: More the quality of cauterizing that you fill the bundle with medicine, that is, scald it according to the quantity of the tolerance of the patient; and take care that it is not too cold nor too hot.</start_of_turn
And thus the patient lies on the two hips, and raises their limbs in their beds and puts one hand over the one which already has men or a cushion; and let you anoint the extremity of the cautery with oil or with an egg of alum or with mucus of fennel or of something similar; and let you enter that into the buttocks with ease, and let the minister hold the bundle and express that outwards twice as much as inwards until it is evacuated in the belly all that is in the credence; and then take out the credence and the patient takes their limbs to the wall.</start_of_turn
And if the medicine forces this to happen, have as much as you can; and if he sleeps like that for the whole night, it is better in the morning.
May it be that even if you criticize him for his belly and his eyes, the hour you iter [treat] him, his pain will depart when he is healed.
And if in the groin you see swelling or abscesses of lead, the hour is that the critic is mild and like a lion, for the critics with whom the children are accustomed.</end_of_turn>
Concerning the care of plagues.</end_of_turn>
I have already said in the division of the care of the plagues that it is proper for the free man, and I say the care of those who are with me and medicines according to the compliment.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that the plagues are diversified according to the humors that cause the plagues and according to the location on which the plague is cast.</end_of_turn
And the causes by which the veins become affected are various, such as a cold or heat of the foot, or incision of space or rib, or percussion with the palm of the hand, or with the fist, or with a needle, or resembling those causes.</end_of_turn
And the plagues that are in the places of the body are also like a plague that falls on the head, or the shoulder, or the foot, or the belly, or the genitals, or resembling those of the limbs.</end_of_turn
And I recommend the care of some plagues so that you stop that ratiocination and rule about the others.
And I will begin with the simple head plagues, for the memory of the composite ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.</end_of_turn>
Therefore I say that when there is a simple head plague and it is not a fracture, the hour you consider: if it is due to cold or resemblance, and the codena has already been drunk only once and it is a great plague, and you fear that there will be an abscess, the hour you must cover it and apply a cephalic plaster as soon as possible; and do not delay until the swelling has gone down. Extract according to the quantity of the virtue of the medicine if there is no other prohibiting cause of frenectomy, especially if the patient who is suffering from the plague is few.</end_of_turn
And let frenectomy be on the side opposite to the affected area of the plague; and keep the patient away from food and drink and coarse food.</end_of_turn
And if from the minimum you prohibit any cause, the hour is that you should diminish the food and do not approach meat or drink.</end_of_turn
And rest upon the plague, if there is an abscess caused by a burn, soak it in oil of rosemary or in wine in which it is stipped.</end_of_turn
And if you are sure of an abscess caused by a burn, the hour is that you rest upon the plague, if it is recent and the air has not changed the powder which I recommend to apply immediately.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already changed that, the hour is that you rest on an enema until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is great or is for incision of space or resemblance, and their lips are not adjusted for pupils, the hour is that you adjust those by suture as I recommend for the suture of them.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is already discovered from the bone and is not retained but for a small ulcer, the hour is that you puncture that and apply medicine to the plague and restore the limb immediately in place of the codena, and command the patient to abstain from eating coarse foods: heads and fat and things that resemble them, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if you find pus in the codena and it does not adhere to the bone, the hour is that you puncture all that is putrefying and drain it out, and apply treatment to it.</end_of_turn
And if in these plagues there is an artery or vein from which blood flows of healthy matter, and it is not separated by medicines, the hour is that you inquire about the artery, and if you find that it is not separated, the hour is that you puncture that with a needle, or ligate that; and if necessary you cause it to bleed that which we have said do not consume, the hour is that you cauterize until the blood is separated.</end_of_turn
And if these plagues are simple and small, the hour is that the cause of them is light; even if you powder over them this powder, which consolidates them when the air changes them.</end_of_turn
And the manner of the powder is as follows: take olive oil one part, of blood of drago two parts, of vinegar not extinct three parts; mix them all together and grind them, and let the plague be filled with it, and let it be constricted by good constriction until it is over that which is on it, and let it be coagulated with the blood.</end_of_turn
And thus strengthen that area with powder, and read that, and do not remove it until this has subsided, for it is not to be despised because it is not hereditary, for the medicine will not be efficacious until it has healed.
And thus each time make it alone with the cautery, when not in their presence they are sick and healed of their illness.</end_of_turn>
And thus do this same operation in great plagues when you consider that it must be interrupted over those and that they are stretched, and only for recent plagues which have not altered them.</end_of_turn
And if they have been altered, and especially when it is in summer, it is not understood for the position of this powder, rather do you care for those with what we have said, namely that you place your hand over these cushions during digestion, or that you place your hand over these grains of barley with water and honey until they are digested; and do care for these with the other cure until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
However if it happens in the plague that a fracture occurs in the bones, even if it is small, then you extract what is necessary from the wound.</end_of_turn
And I say the cure for fractures of the head is in poison.</end_of_turn
Of the plagues of the bowel.</end_of_turn>
However if the plague happens in the bowel, it is not different in medication from the plague of the head when it is simple.</end_of_turn
However if the nerves of the bowels are incised or an artery, it is not in their engineering but that it should be avoided medication that causes violent stypticitation, even as zinc and sage which is old and similar to them because it does not injure the nerves and counteracts that.</end_of_turn And do not place your hand over any cause of coolness, for the substance of the nerves is cold and the continuation of them is in the brain, which is the most important of all the members.</end_of_turn
And if these must be cured by medicines that are light, even as it is caused by washing with lukewarm water, any vegetable matter softened in olive oil or not-olive oil, and boil when washed with lukewarm water and the other stones are lessened in this manner, and then moisten.</end_of_turn
However if the plague is great, then administer sutures, or ligate the edges of it, and do care for that with powder until it is healed.</end_of_turn
However if the plague is depth or happens to the lower part of the body, then pierce that in the area most depressed.</end_of_turn
However if in the plague an artery has already been incised and there is achieved flow of healing, then separate or dry that, or ligate that, or cauterize that if necessary as it causes you at that moment.</end_of_turn
However if the spondyles of the coccyx or all of them have already been incised, and the veins of the bowel have been saved, then you adjust the edges of the coccyx with sutures over the bone of the coccyx and do not touch that; join that and reduce that to its natural figure, and strengthen that by stretching it downwards, and read that for a few days; and then care for that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
However if the plague has already caused pain in the bones, then pierce that; and if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of those that you can from it; and whatever is not apparent, read that until the plague has subsided, and be separate and the evacuation of it be alleviated.</end_of_turn
And if the plague is recent, then powder over that powder which has been recommended to you.</end_of_turn However if in the plague there is a fistula, then care for that with the water from which the memory will come back to you in the stomach.</end_of_turn
If it is percussion of the flank or of the shoulder blade, and sometimes of its depth, then consider more if it is from the plague than from the patient’s illness; for the plague is mortal.</end_of_turn
And if it is not depth and the plague is recent in the abdomen, then you stop in it for the first hour and do not strengthen that because it will not be retained in the depth of it and will return to the heart and worsen the illness, rather stop it at that moment and remove two vegetables a day.</end_of_turn
If the swelling is not present, then rest in the orifice of the plague coat for a while until it subsides; and make the patient sleep over the plague so that what is in them is discharged.
Even if the plague has passed three days or more and the patient does not have spasms, seizures, convulsions or stiffness of the limbs, and sometimes other good signs of recovery, it is still necessary to take care of the plague until it is completely healed.
Even if recovery is excused, and the wound is already open, it is still necessary to know that the fistula has disappeared; therefore care for it at its source.</start_of_turn>
If the plague is caused by incision of space or of bone, and is simple on the surface of the foot or the thigh, then care for it with an ointment that precedes suture, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.</start_of_turn>
Even if inflammation has already passed in the bone, and only pieces remain to be extracted, then twist the plague and cover to extract those pieces, if they are separated.</start_of_turn Even if they are not separated, the intestines enclosed by the plague soften; therefore the extraction of them is eased.</start_of_turn
And as for other plagues that happen in other parts of the body, the help for caring for them is the application of what has been said.</start_of_turn
Of belly plagues.</start_of_turn>
The discomfort that happens in the belly is either great, or little, or moderate.</start_of_turn
A slight disturbance is easily overcome by other means; however, if the reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of the excessive intrusion of the intestines into the abdominal cavity, which swells and engulfs them, because the tissues are already affected.</start_of_turn
Therefore the best discomfort is the moderate one, in which the reduction of the belly is not difficult, just as it is in the two previous cases.</start_of_turn
And it is known that the suture of the belly is done in four ways, however two sutures are common that are used in the sutures of the other parts of the body.</start_of_turn
Two other sutures are specific to the belly, however they are only specific to the suture of the belly.</start_of_turn
And I recommend that you provide any exposure and declaration.</start_of_turn
Therefore I say that when the plague is slight and there is any cause of the belly for that, and it is difficult to reduce it, there are two ways: either by the smallness of the disturbance as we have said, or because the belly is affected by cold air.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when it is like this, cover that with a towel that you soak in warm water alone, or that you squeeze out water from, and apply chamomile, mint, pepper, and cloves to that area until the inflammation has subsided.</start_of_turn
Some vegetables make the water in which they have been steeped sticky, and it is better than plain water for resolving the inflammation.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when the inflammation has subsided, it is necessary to moisten the belly with water in which it is immersed and well-covered, because by this means the tissues are relieved of their excessive tension.</start_of_turn
However, if the tension of the tissues has already been released by this care, it is enough to make an incision with a small instrument with which the wounds are opened.</start_of_turn
The primary care is better when it is appropriate, that is, that it is not excessive and does not necessitate starvation.</start_of_turn
Of the instrument, if its shape:</start_of_turn
One part is sharp, the other is not sharp, and the extremity is blunt, and it should not be as blunt as a sponge, but slightly obtuse.</start_of_turn
Therefore, when the plague is aggravated and has gone out of the belly, it is necessary to reduce it according to its natural form, in its own place, if possible over water, because that is better.</start_of_turn
May when the disruption is wide, and is in the lower part of the belly, then you must lay the patient over the seat two, and suspend your hands further from the seat top; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you must suspend the head and the feet further from the sides.
Similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the belly, then you must suspend your understanding and consideration for a while in order that the part which has the plague may be higher than the other
And thus you must administer it in the great plagues and in the small plagues.
And in the small plagues, suspend the water that is to your preparation, and thus make it that it be administered between your greatest pains, which has the entire disruption with its hand and adjusts the lips of it, and thus uncover from that to that which may cause the suture to be broken for any reason whatsoever.</start_of_turn>
This is the common suture technique: that you grasp the needle, or companion of the needle according to the quantity of the amplitude of the plague; and thus lay aside the extremity of the disruption of the ring finger, and stretch the needle one, or more as you do not put faith in the two extremities of the coccyx, at the two extremities of the heel which is left by the coccyx from the parts downwards, until you have penetrated that part; and you have already added two extremities of the coccyx and two extremities of the heel, so that there are four orders in all.</start_of_turn>
And thus stretch firmly double in the circuit of the needle, and several threads of two parts together, and thus add the two lips and the plague by addition; and thus lay aside the thickness of the finger and fix another needle in that, and thus bind that thus firmly as the first needle; and do not cease doing this until the whole contraction of the plague is complete.</start_of_turn
And if the needles are small between fat and lean, that the fine needles do not prick them unpleasantly; and the large ones are difficult to enter the coccyx, and therefore because of this you must make them lean and fat.</start_of_turn
And you must not make the needle stay in two extremities of the coccyx too long, for so the flesh is not pricked carelessly and the plague is opened before its consolidation.</start_of_turn
And do not prolong the suture for that the plague is not prohibited from consolidation.</start_of_turn
And thus prick the extremities of the needles so that they do not cause the patient to suffer during sleep; and you will suspend over the suture fine powder expanding from all parts, which have the extremities of the needles; and leave them until you know that the plague is already consolidated.</start_of_turn
These methods of suture with needles in cold weather are more convenient in the small plagues, because with them you only need one or two needles or around them.</start_of_turn
More commonly, the second suture is thus: and that you administer with the suture the four extremities, of the coccyx and two extremities of the heel, in a single thread, with a needle in which be firmly enclosed engulfs lean and fat.</start_of_turn
And thus when the needle has penetrated these four extremities, reduce the needle from that middle part from which you began, so that the thread retreats box from the swelling part towards the plague, so that the suture is as strong as the natural suture.
And suspend between each suture the quantity of the thickness of the middle finger.</start_of_turn
This suture saves lives.</start_of_turn>
And thus I cured a a man who was sick with a plague in his belly who was lying in the plague of a palm, and it was the disruption of the greatest plague of a palm, and it was seen from the intestines surrounding two palms of the belly and was the disruption in the middle of the limb; and when I had reduced that after the belly had been outside the plague for forty-eight hours.</start_of_turn
And the plague was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or around, and I cured that one and he is healthy; and thus I have seen for not more than a year, and it is spoken of in their customs.</start_of_turn
And the other doctors had given up that he would not recover; and by a miracle, behold, I cured him, for in that place where no other doctor or medicine was found, I simply put on the plague coat twice a day and gave him honey water until he recovered.</start_of_turn
But I say two special methods of suture according to the narration of Paraula.</start_of_turn
And so you begin the suture of the tendon, from the proximal part towards the distal part.
And thus, when the needle penetrates the tendon and in the middle lacerates straight and along the whole length of the limb, and leaves the end of the gut where the needle has entered; and make penetrate in the other extremity the needle from the distal part towards the proximal part at the other extremity of the limb.</end_of_turn>
And when you have finished making that penetrate, then make another perforation at the same level at the other extremity of the limb; and leave the gut which is in this place, and make penetrate the needle in the other extremity from the distal part towards the proximal part.</end_of_turn>
And make penetrate thus, that the needle penetrates at the same time as the previous perforation at the place where the gut enters the limb that is at the proximal part of it.</end_of_turn
And thus you begin from this middle side and grasp that part which is at the gut in the other side, and withdraw the needle from the tendon which has penetrated, and reduce that in that tendon and close the gut which is at the other side of this limb; and withdraw that from the tendon which is from the limb.</end_of_turn
And make two incisions and another, and make another incision almost another incision until you sew up everything according to that example.</end_of_turn>
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with sutures of skin over which you sew the gut, in such a way that you sew the gut a little incision at the part of the extremity of the tendon, and that you leave that other incision until it is complete.</end_of_turn
But the second kind of suture which we usually call Guilia, and this is of custom, is that you sew according to the manner in which many doctors sew it, in such a way that you add all parts to their proper parts so that you can make them convenient for nature; and press the limb of one part against the limb of the other part, and that is sufficient according to what I have recommended.</end_of_turn>
Because you have kept the needle in the limb at your will from the proximal part, and you will make that penetrate to the distal part in that place, and leave two gut ends; and then you will reverse the needle and make that penetrate from the proximal part to the distal part in two gut ends.</end_of_turn
And thus you will reverse those pieces and make that penetrate whatever parts from the distal part into the proximal part in two limbs other than those which are in the place.</end_of_turn
And this manner of suture is better than the common suture of the leg, and is the suture of which there is remembrance.</end_of_turn>
This is the term for Guilia.</end_of_turn>
And I will tell you this, the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, so that you enter with these into every part a thread, and begin with the needle which is most distant from you, and make that penetrate into the other side according to the suture of those which sew the parts together.</end_of_turn
And you know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, the suture of these is more difficult than that of the other parts of the belly.</end_of_turn
Moreover, the judgment of a plague is the judgment of the others plagues.</end_of_turn
The cause of which is that when you feel the recent plague on the skin that it has already altered that air, and reduces the swelling and closes that and supports that adequately, the hour you pause over that dusty matter.</end_of_turn
And if the air has already altered the plague, the hour you pause over that dust at the present time until it makes a hard stone and keeps the thread, and consolidates gut and limb; and you take care of that just as you take care of the care of the other plagues until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if you do not have medicines at your present time, the hour you pause over that so much, because it begins to swell and wrinkle, and changes that two incisions that you give it, just as you have been taught, until it is healed, because you do not digest any other medicine in great quantities when the plagues are simple.</end_of_turn
Moreover, if you fear that the plague communicates in lesions to the principal members, the hour you cover that you should immerse wool soaked in oil of treatment of good quality, or in scented oil, and leave that in the circuit of the parts which are between the armpits and leave the armpits open.</end_of_turn
If pain or decay is felt in the buttocks or thighs, when swelling appears, it is commonly known that this is the result of a black bile that has become lodged in these areas, and especially if the swelling has spread throughout the thigh and is associated with an opening that extends inwards.
You should know that the pus which is in the large intestine is of a softer kind than that which is in the small intestine
It is difficult to heal the swelling which is called “gegunu” because it does not tolerate any kind of treatment; because of the great multitude of veins which are in it, and for the magnitude of the swelling, and for the subtleness of the body, and for its proximity to nerves
Perhaps if the disease originates from a wound, it is necessary to remove the recent [growth/ulcer] as you deem appropriate in order to reduce the swelling of the belly
Perhaps if it has already passed to the space and is already green or black, then strengthen your hand firmly over the place that is below the navel, in order that there flows out of the wound the blood which is in the veins and arteries there
And immediately cut through that ligament, and suspend two extremities of the hand pending the part beyond the wound, in order that over you there may be relief from the traction of the wound due to the loosening of the tissue and the escape of the blood from the wound
Remember the wounds when they happen in the belly<end_turn>
When there is a disruption in the belly and it is small, it is possible that it will remain contained within the abdominal cavity, in order to help that which was previously diseased in the lower belly with percussion of the hand and which was the wound of the lower part of the stomach, and the wound was old and finished with fistula, and the evacuation of its contents and the swelling.
And thus we must follow the care of the wound already described, even though we do not have confidence in the healing of the wound, but we must diligently continue until the wound is healed and the area is consolidated
And thus we must see that the area is already consolidated, time to remove the evil which caused the accident of the disease in the lower belly; and do not let anything happen because of that evil accident and remain in your thousands of cares engaged in prayer and fasting, and pray between meals and exercise with these things.
And indeed some experienced people say that when there is a small wound in the belly, it is necessary to tie it up in this way: take a large cap; and adjust the two lips of the wound and put a finger of your hand over the two lips of the wound; so when you take hold of these and stretch your hand, you will tear off the head of the wound, which will adhere and not be dissolved
And thus put another finger alongside the first one, and do not stop until you have put on as many fingers as there are in the whole wound.
And thus reduce the wound and cos it with the wound; and keep those heads annexed in the belly until the belly is healed; and do not let any discomfort arise from this
And indeed it is possible that the belly is tied with a fine thread which is useful for the belly of the beast which is annexed to it, because it is finer; and that you grasp the extremity of these fine threads of the belly, and without tearing, and tie the extremity of it to the fine thread, encircling it, and insert that thread through the hole and cos it to that belly, and reduce that which is in the disruption
This way of stitching with fingers is not anything but by way of hope and trust.<end_turn>
Perhaps if the wound is great and wide, more so if it is in one of the small intestines, which is not anything but subcision, and not the healing of it altogether
Care of worms and fistula<end_turn>
You should know that every wound and afterbirth when they grow old and become old, and that is useful, becomes a ulcer, and is not consolidated and always gets out of hand and is not torn off, the hour in any part of the body is universally called fistula and is called that collection of worms
And fistula truly is a foul, hard, white wound which does not cause pain and which is concave like the wound of a wound of pleasure; and for this reason it is called that ulcer of praise.
And it is in such humours that the ulcer softens, which comes out of hand; and when the humidity is strong it is torn off in a few hours And many of these humours are soft, and little, and great, and subtle<end_turn
All those causes have already been mentioned, and the signs of these and their treatment are discussed in the division.
And thus I tell you the treatment for fistula, which is effective by means of surgery with my hand
You know that fistula can occur in all parts of the body; for some are fistulas that penetrate the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the liver, or the intestine, or the bladder, or the kidneys, or to any of the vertebrae, or to any of the compound joints, as with the hand and foot; and of these that give proximity to the main limb and resemblance.
Therefore of all these fistulas that are treated in this way are those of difficult healing, and do not receive cure, and require work and ignorance.
And if it is any fistula of which the depth does not reach these places that I have said, and you expect and confide in the cure of them, and you wish to learn of them, when you wish to attempt to remove or cut away, and if the fistula goes according to rule, then inquire about it from me
May be the fistula is crooked, then investigate that when you attempt to make the incision, for the elevation of the body of the limb is alleviated and curved should overcome the curvature.
And if the fistula has not much gore, it is not in your power to signify about it when you attempt to do so
Therefore bless the works for their works, for the humidity by which you cleanse them goes beyond the others and runs from them
And thus inquire cautiously, according to what method you are able to know if here are bones or nerves, and whether the curvature of the fistula is long or short, or if it is a fistula to which there are many wounds and this is over that on which all your strength, your prudence, your pains, and your invention of the pain depend because of your compression with your hand over the area, and resemblance to the signs and the accidental causes of the apostema
And when you have stood over all those causes at rest, then see the treatment with confidence: and that you consider whether it is an apparent fistula close to the surface or in a distant place, long from the joint, or of nerves, or of an artery, or of a vein, or of any of the places which I have mentioned to you and told you about
Then dry the fistula according to what was said before in the narration of it, and stay away from that which is in that filtration and from corrupt flesh, and what is born in the wound of the flesh, or from pus and resemblance, and heal that which has entered until it is healed.
May be the fistula is of great depth, and is according to rule, then cover that within the area as much as possible, and almost remove all your corrupt flesh; and give warm compresses wrapped in medicines that are acute, and insert those into the curvature of the fistula, which you have understood with the hand.
And do thus with whatever herbs are within that the acute medicine has corroded all that is rotten in the curvature of the fistula from corruption
And thus restore that which engenders healthy flesh until it is healed.
May be it is not healed by this, then cauterize that as we have recommended
May be the cause of the fistula is one or more bones and is due to your certificate that, then inquire about that and dry that according to what we have recommended, if you do not prohibit any cause of a vein or of a nerve or of a main member as we have said
May be it is to your discovery and is in it any corruption and blackness, then remove that which is within that until the corruption is overcome; and then heal that which is left until it is healed
And if it is not healed and brings you discomfort like this as before, then you know that you have not reached the eradication of the corruption; and then you discover about it further and inquire carefully about it and the strengthening of your right hand, and restore that
Therefore, if he is healthy, it is well; but if not, know that the cause of this corruption is in the profound depths of the body, which has not been recognized, and to which only laying hands can be applied.
And if the corruption is small, or if you are able to pierce it, then at that moment you pierce it with fine forceps that are suitable for this purpose.</end_of_turn>
And if there is movement of bones, then it is extremely necessary to extract all of them, and of those do not leave any cause for your strength.</end_of_turn
Maybe there is some cause from the humors, and at the beginning there is no fear or error, but it is necessary to cut those ligaments or flesh if they are here, and to break the bones.</end_of_turn
Maybe if you are not prepared to extract the bones at this moment, then pause over the ulcer until it has scabbed over, and leave that until the bones of flesh and ligaments are nearby, and keep the ulcer from solidifying, and restrain the section that you have cut in your operation.</end_of_turn>
Thus, if you fear, pause over the joint immersed in warm olive oil, or the Egyptian unguent, or in some of the above-mentioned unguents, for when they are softened, the ligaments will be separated from the bones, and the pain will be relieved.</end_of_turn
Maybe if it is a large bone such as a limb or a thigh, and what is corrupted is only the surface of it, then at that moment pierce that with fine forceps only as far as necessary until that black spot and corruption has disappeared, and then restore the ulcer.</end_of_turn
Maybe if the corruption is great and has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and all that has been opened until the corruption has passed, and at that moment cure that which has solidified.</end_of_turn
And I recommend that you ask a man in his bed to stay with you and assist you in your operation.</end_of_turn>
For a young man who is approximately xxx years old, who has suffered pain in his heel, and from whose foot there is abundant discharge of bad air from the body, it is necessary to perform a large incision in the heel, because the bad air has spread throughout the body, and it is a matter of great discharge.</end_of_turn
And thus it is necessary to extend the time of the operation due to the error of the doctors until the discharge has subsided, and to remove any remaining matter. The healing of the wound should be delayed until the limb is closed, and all the painful spots that were causing the suffering should be treated with poultices and compresses that absorb moisture and humors from the body.</end_of_turn
And thus many doctors have been called in for two years, and I have not heard anything about it, until I was summoned.</end_of_turn
And I saw the limb with the wound and the matter running from it from those orifices for a great distance; and the color of the limb was pale and yellow.</end_of_turn
And thus I introduced the hook into one of those orifices and reached the bone.</end_of_turn
And thus I examined all the orifices and found that they had all penetrated to the very bottom of the wound.</end_of_turn
And thus I closed my hand and made an incision into one of those orifices until I scraped a piece of the bone, and I dressed that corruption, which was already dead and corrupted, and it was already decaying and putrefying; and a part of the wound had already penetrated the marrow.</end_of_turn
And thus I was overcome with what was written to me and prepared for the uncovering of the bone.</end>
I declare that it was not in the bone, but in that corruption that was exuding and that I saw, and I had already drained it.</end>
And thus I stopped the restoration of the wound with conservative medicine for a long time, and it is not consolidated.</end
And thus I repeated the process and found further corruption on the bone, just as before.
And thus I saw that from that corruption there appeared to me a perforation, and I made the healing of the wound and the restoration, and it is not restored.</end
And thus I discovered another ulcer and I continued to perforate the bone little by little, until I had perforated the restoration of the limb, and it was not restored until I had opened it up to the palm of the hand, and I extracted that with the marrow, and I restored that with medicines, and it is consolidated and healthy.</end>
E no is necessary iteration in the operation of them and section of them save for the disposition of the fragility of them and the scarcity of their tolerance and fear of their death, which in them proceeds at all hours by excessive evacuation without small harm.
Therefore it is good to keep the whole body sound, and nothing is better than to take care of their spirit in the body; and it is a good thing to restore their virtue; and it is reported in their arrangements and they do not make them contradict in walking or sleeping or in any cause.</end_of_turn>
But if it is urgent in the body already trembles, then take this way: take a piece of lint and grasp that at the end of that prominence, and command someone to stretch that out to the sides; and suspend that lint of wool thicker than the first lint; and then place that over the bone that you left behind, and stretch out the limb so that you can reach the bone to its parts, and uncover the bone over the place where you want to close it so that the wound does not hurt the bone.</end_of_turn
And suspend a cushion or table behind the bone adequately, because when you do that it is not forbidden to cut off the corrupted bone.
And take care that the cutting be small on the corrupted part, because if it is in the cavity of the bone corruption and does not appear in its appearance to the feeling, and force the closure of it another time.</end_of_turn>
And if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, bring forward a continuous part from the other, and the corruption is at the middle of the bone or in part of it, then uncover the bone throughout; and then suspend a cushion behind, and cut that from the first part where the corruption is until the closure of the other part is completed.</end_of_turn>
And the cutting be small according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.</end_of_turn>
And if the corruption is in the joint, puncture that corrupted joint, and cut the bones where it is continued from the other side.</end_of_turn>
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then it is not in their ratio but engineering.</end_of_turn
And if the corruption is in the part of the hand or foot, it is not easy; however take care that you inquire about the corruption in what way it appears to you, and open that, and tell that according to any arrangement that is possible for you, and in case it is rectified for you, when it does not make you contradict the vein or nerve.</end_of_turn
And you must know what is incisions and what saws to incisions these bones are not according to the situation of the bones, and the preparation of those, and the size of those, and the thinness and the greatness and the smallness of those, and the hardness and the rarity of those; because you must prepare for every kind of operation the appropriate instruments for that operation.</end_of_turn
And you must know that this operation means for you about the kind of instrument from which you will make use; when indeed it is great study and long and knowledge of the methods of this art, and testimony of the methods of treating diseases, which you have already had for your purpose that is convenient to them from all ailments.</end_of_turn
And I tell you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will find useful and which you will experience in your prohibition which you will experiment with on the others.</end_of_turn Form of saw:
Form of another saw.</end_of_turn
Form of another large saw.</end_of_turn
Form of file.</end_of_turn And the head of this file according to the shape of the star-shaped key, and the points of it according to the shape of the heel of the foot.</end_of_turn
And it does not suffice that at those times the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or the large mouth is wide open.</end_of_turn
Form of smaller razor.</end_of_turn
Form of flat razor.</end_of_turn
Form of another saw quite well: let it be arched more and the sharpness of it of iron, and the handle of it pointed downwards quite well.</end_of_turn Form of it:</end_of_turn
Reasoning of the kind in which it has concaved.
Another reasoning of the subtle kind
A reasoning of another kind concerning curvature of the extremities
A reasoning like that of a small tentacle
Another reasoning of the lesser kind
A reasoning of the kind which resembles a ray, and the extremity is like a saw, and is seen in many places in the ratio of the bones:
A reasoning like that of a ray which is pierced by the bones:
And the extremity is triangular and acute at the end.
And it is like the iron of India, and it is like covering all the causes that we have said of rasories and incisions and saws.
Of the incision of the extremities and the sawing of the bones
The extremities are affected either by an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic cause, or as you have treated that corruption for the care of those medicines and the care does not relieve it, or sometimes the corruption goes away from the limb without having perceived any cause, when in such a case you must understand that you have to cut into that limb in order that the evil should vanish because of death or malice which is more harmful to the limb.
And the sign that this happens to the limb is that the limb is black within before it is healed that the fire has already consumed it, or that it turns black almost immediately before the blackening has passed from within that limb which you saw to be black, and therefore I order you to cut into that limb immediately
And in the same way if the cause of the corruption is a venomous blow, such as that of a scorpion or a viper or of a bite of a worm, and the like
If the corruption or the blow is in the extremity of the finger, then you must cut the finger and do not leave space for the corruption to enter the hand
And in the same way if you reach the hand, then you must cut that from the root of the bone, and do not leave space for the corruption to enter until it has passed from the bone of the arm
Or if you see that it is necessary, cut into the arm at the joint
And if it happens again that the corruption goes away and sometimes the limb is saved, then in that case the death of the disease is the remedy; and to give another cause or treatment in such case is useless
And in the same way if the corruption happens in the foot when it affects the toe of the foot, then you must cut into that between two bones of the foot.
If it touches the heel of the foot, then you must cut through the whole foot Even if it has penetrated to the nail, then you must cut through the nail at the joint of the nail
And if the corruption has already reached the nail, then in that case there is no remedy but to let the disease run its course, and leave the patient to his fate
The manner of cutting or sawing the limb is that you grasp the ligament at the point where you wish to cut, and grasp another ligament over the area; and extend one minister to the edges, and extend another minister at the center; and you separate the flesh which is between two ligaments without stretching too much, until the whole flesh has been discovered; and then cut or saw accordingly.
And you must prevent all movement from all parts around the area so that it does not touch the area itself, and that the patient receives an adjusted wound and gentle cautery
Even if blood flows when working, then you cauterize the area cautiously, or suspend the bleeding by any means that can restrict the blood; and then return to your medicine until it has been completed
And finally, tie the affected limb securely with a ligament at your convenience, and care for it until it is healed
And I advise you that you should send a man to the sickbed of the foot of the patient, because this is the way that I have seen and heard that this kind of accident has been treated with great success in other places.
And this corruption first of all appears in the foot of the toe before it affects the whole foot.
And thus that man prepared himself for the pain, put more than enough salve on the part that was suffering from pain and distress, and the painful area entered the joint, and peace was restored.
Long time has passed since that medicine was applied to the thumb indicating that corruption
And thus I saw that the excessive heat that had been applied to the hand of the medicine had disappeared from the body, and that the swelling began to subside in the other finger that had been placed on the hand of the medicine; and that the excessive heat did not remain, but went away to the other finger that was placed on the hand
And he asked me to prick his hand, and I did not dare to do what I was hoping to do concerning the excessive heat that I feared would cause the hand to die, for the power of the disease was great.
And when he awoke, he returned to his place and told me that the man had prepared himself and pricked his hand entirely, and he was healed.
I have not yet finished telling you this story, except that it is a witness to what occurs in this disease, and what is its significance and for what reason it is useful
From the care of the physician and the quality of the plaster cast with the medicine.<end_turn>
When an abscess occurs in a fleshy limb and the space of the abscess is prolonged until the collection of pus has formed, and it is broken and perforated, and the pus is discharged, and the limb remains as before as if it were a vessel, and the cord that was under it is cut away as if it were a thread, and there is no further corruption, and it does not leave an imprint on the bone or nerves or ligaments, it is called an incision, and is not named an fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged until the corruption spreads to some limb, then it is called a fistula and not an incision
And the treatment of it is that the cord be completely cut through as if it were revolted, and more so when it is finely divided and is useful like wax, and comfort that it does not adhere to the limb by its corruption.
However, if you hope that the cord will adhere and that the corruption will not cause any further consequences, and if the cord has become soft, then in that case treat it as if it were plastered
And you must consider the nature of the wound, and if it is great, and if the limb stinks of gangrene, then you must plaster that limb with Egyptian medicine which is made of olive oil, vinegar and lead and which receives ground pearls, and which is adjusted in a vessel, and which is covered over the wound until the medicine has dried and reached its full effect.
And do the same with the other limb, dissolve it in water and honey; and plaster the limb and strengthen its bones, and leave the medicine on for two hours.
And remove that from the wound; and do this for several days until the limb is healed and the swelling is gone
And some physicians plaster with water of ashes, when it is not at your disposal this medicine; and take ashes of rue, and put them on water; and do this until you are convinced that the limb is healed.
And if the disease does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the water of the ashes, then you must plaster with water and honey and vinegar, and plaster with wine and honey mixed together, because the property of honey is to soften and cleanse, and the wine makes the limb adhere, and especially when there is excessive stickiness and dryness in the wine
And when you have done this several times and you are convinced that the limb is healed, then plaster with water that makes the flesh rise in it
And you take of fennel seeds and dissolve them in scented oil and vinegar; or you plaster with some medicines and add others which have the properties that I have already written in the treatise on medicines.
And if the bone of the limb is straight in which the needle of the plaster has not been received, then you must gradually enlarge that part of the iron with a small file, and stop when it is enveloped in Egyptian or basil ointment until it is enlarged
Similarly, if the bone is wide, then you must suture the edges of the limb and leave them as long as the plaster has been added
And if the bone of the limb is elevated to the armpits, then dry that part of the limb where the bone is so that the limb can pass through it, because when the limb is straightened out in the bend of the limb, the flesh will be generated in it.
If it is not possible to drain the pus from the wound surrounding the base of the bone as you wish, then know that you must perforate it and prepare the limb for the procedure for which it is commonly used, that is, to break it off with a brace as is appropriate for your practice and without leaving any cause for suspicion.
Whoever is on the limb, whom you keep for an hour, so that it heals from the pressure of the brace. And that you may know whether the limb is broken or not, or whether the fracture is digested or not, or is not digested.
Therefore you must consider the position of the limb, whether the patient experiences pain or not, and if there is swelling in the limb
When your medicine is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the material that was applied to the wound has already adhered, or if it is properly adherent, then know that you must remove the dressing or plaster for a few days, and when you remove the dressing, change the bandage for another and renew it.
And if there is some slight space remaining in the limb, do not be discouraged by the adhesion of the dressing, for the healing of the limb is appropriate, for in some cases the formation of pus in the wound is delayed, and in others it is useful to break it up.
And if the limb has remained immobile for several days without adhering, know that the limb does not adhere; and if the adherence of the limb is delayed, this is a prolonged cause, then you must adjust in the excision of the medicines, and if the medicines are moistened in their substance and in their power, they are dry just as well as if they were powdered today, when they are adjusted in excess of their necessary addition
And the most useful remedy for this is to take powdered gypsum and dissolve it in olive oil, and apply it to the limb with some ointment in its substance, and keep it warm, and use this remedy for this purpose
And thus it is seen in this action that, when not bound, gypsum is more effective when it is ground up until it is coarse, and use it in this way; or that you take myrrh and aloes and powder them, and sprinkle them on the honey when it is cold, and apply all this over the wound and strengthen it over the limb; and do the same with the honey that you have ground up until it is coarse, and sprinkle it over the wound and strengthen it
And many remedies of this kind are administered with long-lasting and noble herbs, such as lily of the valley (which is a lily) and centaury, and barley and chamomile, and use these simples or adjust them, crush them and sprinkle them on the honey that I have recommended; and use them
And if the limb is prolonged, and it is not healing with this care, know that the corruption is in the root of the limb, and already make an inquiry in the bones or in the other parts hard or flexible, or in the ligaments; then you must care for it with fistular care, as is said above.</start_of_turn>
From the care of swellings and nails attracted and added incision of the digit and section.
A swelling is a swelling that does not leave the nail of the finger of the hand or foot, and is very strong in the other fingers, and as it is prolonged and its care is less precious, or is a post-caut embolism, or is corrupted, and the limb becomes soft until it consumes the root of the nail, and is very strong in corrupting that whole thing, and is harmful to the limb until it emits a foul odor, and the limb is pale.
Therefore, when you have what we have said in the division and do not confirm your care, know that you must make an incision throughout the whole thickness of the nail and immediately cauterize the wound immediately so that the cautery does not do any harm in this matter.
And if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the blood vessels of the nail are already coming out and weakening the flesh around the joints, and the pain begins to pierce and spread throughout, know that you must make a narrow incision to leave free the angle of the nail that is causing the pain, and remove that and put in its place a plaster that can burn the corrosive matters until they are all gone; and then take care of the area until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If corruption has already begun in the bones, it is necessary that you insert the needle into them and extract them, for it is never healthy that they should be corrupted in them.
If sometimes corruption and decay go towards the nails, then insert the needle into one of the nails as it is opportune, and take care that it is healthy.</end_of_turn>
If the nail has undergone percussion or drawing, and there is acute pain, then immediately apply flebotomy to the patient, and dry the nail with a blunt lancet with a transverse section, and keep your hand over the area to prevent the nail from breaking.
Just as it is natural in the greater number of households, strong is the flesh, strong is the bone, or strong is the nail.</end_of_turn>
And these are born in the root of the joint, or it is the birth of them in the nails of the fingers.</end_of_turn> The one that is born in the nails of the fingers does not worsen, but that which is born in the joints is painful.</end_of_turn>
And of those that are born fleshy, the section is slight, and it is that you insert that which must have its root with a blunt edge.</end_of_turn>
And of those that are born in the root of the joint, the care is difficult; and therefore keep your hand away from the wound.</end_of_turn
If it is necessary to open the nail, cover that you insert at the beginning the cavity of the nail with a circular incision within the bone, and then grasp with one of those convenient forceps, and take care that it is healthy.</end_of_turn
If consolidation occurs among the nails between their roots or for the birth of the bone that does not go away, or for consolidation of pus or for burning of fire, or for stiffness, then cover that consolidation until the nails return to their natural shape.</end_of_turn
And keep between their layers of lint soaked in olive oil so that they do not adhere too firmly, and separate between these, or place between these a layer of soft lead until it is consolidated as much as necessary.</end_of_turn
In the same way as consolidation occurs in the nails with the palm, then dry that consolidation as it is prepared and conform to the figure of the limb.</end_of_turn>
From the origin of the vice, so are varices.</end_of_turn
Vices are varices, and these are veins surrounded by thick veins filled with melencolic fluid which are found in the limbs of the body, and their greatest progress is in the veins of travelers, laborers, and porters.</end_of_turn
Therefore it is necessary to administer purgatives of the black bile of the body several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.</end_of_turn
There are two methods of treatment for these: one is that it is given injections and that one black sand be taken away, and the other method is that the vein is elevated and all of it is extracted.</end_of_turn
The incision of these is as follows: at the beginning embroider the limb with cold water until the black sand is resolved, which is useful for the limb, and then tighten the limb of the patient at the part of the wound to the upper part of the ankle with a bandage, and grasp the vein in one place, or in two or three in a wide section, and elevate the black sand with the thumb of the lower part of the limb to the inside of the limb, and pull it out, until the amount you want has been expelled, which will tolerate the virtue of the wound.</end_of_turn
And so do these things, and command them to abstain from foods that generate black bile.</end_of_turn
And repeat the treatment with flebotomy when the veins are engorged and when the patient feels better.</end_of_turn
Therefore the elevation of these is as follows: raise the limb of the patient, if there is swelling in it, and grasp it in water until it becomes wrinkled and the veins are relaxed; or that it be exercised by a strong exercise, if there is no water at your disposal, until the limb is whitened.</end_of_turn
And keep the cord bound in the root of the vein for section in the long or behind it must give the ankle, or in the bottom of it must cut off the circulation.</end_of_turn
E aprop uobre la codena am uncis e excorja la vena de tota part entro que appara al sentiment, e es deves la appericio de lu que veces aquela roga declinant a negror.
Therefore when you have evacuated and opened the arm, sometimes that white stuff that was like a thread will go away.
And now put your hand over that ray that is inside until it is raised up and away from the arm, and suspend that until once or twice a lion has gone by.</start_of_turn>
And now cut another piece and put it alongside that piece for three fingers, and then draw out the arm from below the vein until it appears.</start_of_turn
And now elevate that and pierce that towards the little toe, and then draw out that and elevate that until it is level with the second incision, and then draw out that from the incision above that.</start_of_turn
And do that until you have drawn out that from the most prominent or highest part of all the incisions, until all is healed; and then pierce that again.</start_of_turn>
And if you do not obey my order to draw out and elevate, then put in a strong needle double and ligate that and draw out, or put in your hand the ray and twist your hand over all until it is bled dry.</start_of_turn> And take care that it is not pierced; for if it is fractured, that will be difficult to elevate that limb and will bring discomfort to the patient for that night.</start_of_turn
And when that is all gone, then pause over the place of the wound and cover it with slippery ointment of wine and oil and unrefined oil, and care for that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And if the vein is contracted having thorns which are surrounding the parts, and that is not in accordance with what has been said, then you must cover that wound over all the parts of the thorns and the surrounding parts, and then suspend that with a needle until that whole thing is elevated.</start_of_turn
Take care that you do not pierce the vein or damage that, for that will make it difficult for you to elevate that; and use your prudence in that.</start_of_turn
Describe the appearance of the wound from which the vein has been drawn out.</start_of_turn
It is not acute like needles or sharp at the end so as not to damage the vein; and it is of great flexibility like a lion, for if it were flexible, it would break the vein by its flexibility; having that said, it has a sufficient size for what we have said.</start_of_turn
Extraction of the vein of the thigh.</start_of_turn
This vein is engendered in the swamps in the low countries like the Ganges in India and in the dry lands of Arabica and in the lands of India poor in vegetation and without trees.</start_of_turn
And it is also engendered in other parts of the body in other swamps.</start_of_turn
And the origin of it is putrefaction that comes from leaving the arm like a serpent with its head and tail in the body and with worms and beetles and worms that are engendered between the arm and the flesh.</start_of_turn
And the sign of the coming of this is that the vein bursts in the swamp with violent inflammation; and at that place is seen blood; and from that place the vein begins to withdraw from the place of that bloodstain which appears to be like a plant root.</start_of_turn
And thus when you feel the limb, then cover that part with a plum of lead whose weight is like that of two dracs. Enter into two dracs, and notice that and leave the lead suspended from the limb.</end_of_turn
And as many veins as there are for any reason outside, cover them with lead and do not neglect that.</start_of_turn And if the limb is not prolonged, then you must pierce a part of it and cover the remaining; and do not pierce that from which there is a risk of breaking the skin and causing swelling and inflammation in the place and ulcers.</start_of_turn
Because it must be treated gently and be drawn out little by little, until it is completely withdrawn from behind the limb and does not leave any cause in the body.</start_of_turn
The vein is said to be about five palms and a thumb in length, and already I perceive that it is full to the extent of twenty palms.
If it is suspected at the time of treatment, then introduce the needle into the heel of the foot and perforate that for as long as necessary to expel all that is in the matter, and apply poultice to the area for several days with medicines; and then care for the ulcer for healing.</end_of_turn>
The vein has many branches, especially when it approaches the ankle or the foot, and it gives rise to many small arteries.</end_of_turn>
And therefore care for it as we have said before concerning the division and in what we have mentioned.</end_of_turn>
From the section above, worms are generated under the skin and is called bovine disease.</end_of_turn>
This disease is called in every land bovine disease because it is found in cows and is very common in the groin and the buttocks, and it extends throughout the body, causing swelling and damage, and it is recognized by the patient's pain in each limb until the groin is ruptured and the intestines are expelled.</end_of_turn
And its generation is due to the putrefaction of certain humors as well as from worms and serpents and worms and lice in the belly.</end_of_turn
And it is feared for its malice, because when it enters the body and is elevated to the head, it causes vomiting and breaks the head, and what is in the intestines is expelled.</end>
Therefore, when you want to cure it and extract it, do not do so without first restraining the patient's movement and showing him the appearance of the disease, and when you have seen that the swelling has subsided and that the pain has ceased, then dry over it and extract it.</end_of_turn>
And if it is pressed in the buttock and you do not see it, then place the cautery on the surface of the foot until it is dead, and the greatest cause of fear is the corruption of the bone by which the bone is corrupted as we have said.</end_of_turn
Or if sometimes this thing comes close to the head by vomiting, then tighten over the navel with great strength, and dry over it, and extract it; and let the patient use an emetic to evacuate putrid humors, and keep away from foods that generate putrefaction.</end_of_turn>
The section is over the bovine disease.</end_of_turn
This disease is called in our land nafir, and it is a pain that is perceived in various parts of the body, and it is usually transferred from limb to limb.</end_of_turn
And I have already seen this according to what I recommended to you.</end_of_turn I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I saw that she had swelling in the veins of her arms and I saw a small swelling in the groin of her arm, and when I stayed with her for an hour, I saw that the swelling had subsided as much as if it had never been there, as if it had never existed.
And then the pain in that place disappeared and the swelling remained in the muscle, and I stayed there for an hour.</end_of_turn
And so it went away in the other parts of the body until it reached the other arm.</end_of_turn
And I recommended to her that she should rest throughout the body as I have seen; and I was amazed at the transformation and the speed with which the limbs changed places.</end_of_turn And I had already seen this before in my studies according to that manner, but I have seen others who have suffered from pain when their limbs were rearranged from limb to limb.</end_of_turn But I have not seen anything like that in the girls.</end_of_turn
And I do not think that this is anything but because the woman was old, and she had many wrinkles on her skin and veins exposed, and in this appearance she felt that sensation of changing limbs.</end_of_turn
And it is necessary that this phenomenon does not appear according to this retrograde reasoning in those who are delicate and have humors full of veins hidden under the skin.</end_of_turn
And if you want to cure her, and she feels that pain, do not be afraid of the vomiting as we have said; tighten over that area and leave her with curiosity and dry over that until the swelling is gone, and cauterize the place.</end_of_turn
If you do not feel the pain in your thighs at this time, know that it is because of the excess of humors in the body, which expel air, and that the cause of these is the retention of bile pills and seeds of serapi, resembling grains of sand.
From the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are varied according to their species, and according to the places of the body in which they are cast, because their diversity is that those which have large heads and small, concave, and soft ones are solid; and those which have three angles, and those which have tongues; and those which have handles.
And concerning the symptoms of the servant when the arrow has penetrated him, and has gone through his bowels, it is said that this happens from the swelling of the liver which is above the brain, because of the heat of the bile, and vomiting, and dizziness, and yellowing of the urine, and swelling and yellowing of the tongue, and spasm and mixture of understanding and vomiting of bile, and great strength is lost of the voice, and the word is abolished and destroyed, and it is said of the place of the wound a white moisture resembling grains of sand, and that it looks like the abundance of urine.
And therefore if you see these symptoms, then you must abstain from the care and extraction of the arrow, if it is not outside
When the arrow has penetrated the heart, it is because of the left nipple, and it is certain that it is not a trivial cause; and great strength is seen in the movement of the arrow which is similar to the movement of a worm, and it brings forth the black plague, and if there is any coldness in the limbs, and sweating, and fainting; and therefore you know that death approaches immediately
When the arrow has hit the lung, it immediately brings forth bloodstained spumes of the plague, and the blood vessels that are above the belly become clotted, and the color of the sickness changes, and great breath is exhaled, and there is a request for fresh air.
When the arrow has penetrated the membrane which is in the feet, and there is pain, then it is because of the small bones, and it causes great pain and great swelling, and does not move a single muscle in the body
When the arrow has penetrated the stomach, then great strength is seen from the ongoing plague of any indigestion.
When the arrow has penetrated the belly and is stuck there, then there is seen any wound of the plague, or the membrane, or the intestine which is broken, and there is no hope for the cure of the extraction of the arrow
When the arrow has penetrated the bladder, and comes out with urine, and proceeds from the bowels to the outside, and there is great pain in the abdomen, then it is known that it is fatal
And concerning the other members as well, such as the face, the neck, the chest, the flanks, the armpits, the shoulders, the spine, the ribs, the breastbone, and the limbs, they are saved according to the greatest possibilities when the arrow does not find any vein or artery and is not a venomous arrow
And I recommend to you what I have seen of the being of these arrows, for that it signifies concerning the care of your body
The cause of which is that in a man who has been pierced by an arrow in the tear of the eye in the root of the nose, and I extracted it from the other side, I left the gray of the eyebrow of the eye, and he was healed, and did not suffer any damage to the eye at night.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew who had been pierced by it in the gray of the eyebrow of the eye, I left the eyelid behind, and the arrow was already hidden and could not be recovered from him except for a small part to which it adhered to the thigh, and it was a great arrow of the Turks, with a lion's head in which there were no eyebrows
And behold the Jew, and he did not suffer any damage to his thigh eye
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian who had been pierced by it in the chest, and it was an Arabian arrow, and there are eyebrows to it; and when I inquired about it between two guides, and it was already submerged in the Christian's chest; and when I had become cunning with that one, I managed to extract it, and the Christian was healed
And I extracted another arrow from a man who had it lodged in his navel, and I thought he would surely die from it; however, since he had passed xxx days without any change in his condition, I deduced that the arrow was no longer causing him any harm.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had been shot twice, and consolidated was the plague upon him; however, since I had been there for a short time, I discharged the arrow from its root.</end_of_turn>
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had been shot in the belly, and the plague was consolidated within her; she had not recovered in her condition even after many days, and the woman had not suffered from any other natural ailments.</end_of_turn>
And I saw another man to whom an arrow had been shot in the face, and the plague was consolidated; the arrow was removed, without causing him any pain, and he remained in the same condition.</end_of_turn
And I extracted the arrow from the princeps of the king who had it lodged in the middle of his nose; he had already declined to the right side a little, and the arrow was completely hidden.</end_of_turn
And I was called to the care of him shortly after the arrow was shot within three days.</end_of_turn>
And then I saw that the plague of the arrow was not severe; then I asked her what was the cause of her suffering, and she did not feel it; however, she felt a tingling sensation, leaving the right side relaxed, and then I hoped that this tingling sensation was due to the extremity of the arrow.</end_of_turn
And I applied to her the lobe which has an astringent and digestive virtue, confident that the lobe would disappear because I saw the root of the arrow there, so that it would secrete over that.</end_of_turn
And no further significant accident occurred at the place where the arrow had been; I continued to apply the lobe to him for several days, and no accident occurred; the plague was consolidated during that time, and the patient recovered from the pain caused by the extraction of the arrow within a few days, since on the eighth day he felt the arrow no longer remained in his nose and recounted that to me.</end_of_turn
And then I stopped the acute corrosive medicine for several days until I had seen enough; and when I had examined it, I saw that the extremity of the arrow had adhered to the substance.
Then I applied the antidote of that acute medicine until I saw the extremity of the arrow clearly; and I left it at rest for the time being until four months had passed.</end_of_turn>
And when the plague had become more intense, I thought it would be possible to remove the pliers from it, and I bound it; however, I did not observe any change, for the hours I did not cease to wonder and speculate about it, until one day I devised a way to remove it without pliers, as it is described at the end of the chapter, and I extracted it; and then I restored the patient.</end_of_turn>
And many doctors say that the cartilage of the nose is not restored; I restored that as well, and the plague was consolidated, and the patient was cured of his pain entirely, and I never remembered it again for any cause.</end_of_turn
I recommend to you the quality of extracting arrows, because you must pause and explain what you do not understand from what I have said, since the parts of this art and the definitions of this are not comprehended by me from the narration or from what you are free.</end_of_turn
And the learned artisans compare little to me; and as for what is present, I find that what is absent is also present; and they find new operations and new instruments that must descend from the causes of the art when an accident occurs.</end_of_turn
Therefore I say that arrows are not simply extracted from the limbs in which they are embedded, but according to two methods: either by attraction of the surrounding tissue or by the contrary of the other side.</end_of_turn
And that which is extracted by the tissue where it is entered, or is an arrow proceeding from a cartilaginous place, is thrown out and extracted.</end_of_turn
If you do not obey this precept of the hour when the cat is struck, the hours cover that you must leave it for several days until the surrounding flesh is softened, and the attraction and evacuation of it are relieved.</end_of_turn
Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and you do not obey this precept, you must leave it for several days and repeat the attraction and movement in each day, and it will finally be extracted.</end_of_turn
If you do not obey my orders promptly, then I command that you perforate in the circuit of the vein in that limb from which the pain has departed until the limb is dilated by the vein, and then extract that.
May be the vein is already hidden in the limb and is hidden from feeling, I command you to inquire about that sensation, and if you find that sensation, I command you to pull that sensation immediately towards those symptoms which are convenient for the traction of the limb.</end_of_turn>
And if you are unable about it for the constriction of the plague and for the length of the period, and here it is neither bone nor nerve nor vein, then I command you to perform this over the plague until it is dilated and that the vein can be extracted.</end_of_turn
And if you have doubts about them which are long, then I command you to break the flesh in which it is inserted throughout all its extent; and take care of that, if you are unable to evade the flesh in the fracture of the bones and in twisting of those until you obey.</end_of_turn
When you perform the extraction of the vein in any place where it is, then use with torque of your hand and forceps at all parts until you make that obey; and take care that there is some degree of flexibility that the vein is not fractured and that it is easily extracted from its difficult traction and from that extraction.</end_of_turn
And if you are unable about that of your time, then I command you to leave for several days until the parts which are in the circuit of the limb are healed, and then repeat that until the pain is relieved.</end_of_turn May be you do an opposite flow of blood, then I command you to administer what we have said of care in the head.</end_of_turn
Keep your virtue of incision of vein or of nerve, or of string, and administer with every possible ability your ability to avoid the vein; and do that with ease, tranquility, promptness and calmness as I have said and as you are commanded.</end_of_turn
And thus you must contract the vein so that the limb is according to the figure according to which you must bring about the evacuation of the vein, for that is more useful.</end_of_turn May be that is not possible for you, then I command you to administer what is possible for you according to the figures.</end_of_turn
May be the veins that are outside are opposite to the other side, or that already from them proceeds some part to the parts outside, or makes swelling of the extraction of the vein for the feeling of the part furthest from the bone proximate; then you must desist from that; and let the incision be according to the quantity in which they grasp the forceps; and then pull that, for it is useful for the pain.</end_of_turn
May be it is retained in the bone, then I command you to twist the limb according to the opposite of what we have said until the vein presses on the bone, and expand it halfway, and then extract that.</end_of_turn
Or leave that for several days, and then repeat that until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if the pain of the vein is in that, then I command you to press that towards it.</end_of_turn
May be the pain is acute and you want to administer an impulse, then I command you to insert it and that, if it is deaf, cause it to stumble so that between the cavity of the limb and the edge of the vein you press that.</end_of_turn
May be the vein is concave, then I command you to press that strongly inwards so that the vein is relieved by that.</end_of_turn
And if the vein is venomous, then I command you to drain all the flesh in which it is seen, if it is possible for you, and take care of that which seems to please you.</end_of_turn
If the needle penetrates the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough to touch that area with the finger, you may safely excise that area and prevent any damage to veins or nerves, and extract that, and apply pressure if necessary, and care for that until it is healed.
Method of forceps with which needles are grasped.</end_of_turn>
Their extremities are like the beak of an owl, which are firm when they grasp the needle so that they do not let it go.</end_of_turn
And of those are various species, large, small, medium, according to the quantity of the greatness of the needle and its thinness, and the extent of the wound, and the constriction of the area.</end_of_turn
Like that for the ray so that the passage of the needle in the curved wound is alleviated and is pressed by that.</end_of_turn
Of phlebotomy of the veins.</end_of_turn
The veins from which it is usually customary to perform phlebotomy are ...</start_of_turn of which in the head there are ...</start_of_turn two pulsating veins which are near the ankles, which are called the great saphenous veins; two veins that are in the two temporal bones that appear; and two veins in two tears of two holes that are called the lacrimal veins; and the vein prepared in the middle area of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and two veins that are at the ear; and two veins that are in the lips; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and these are the veins that are called the palpebral veins; and there are two veins that are on the tongue.</start_of_turn Greater are the veins that are phlebotomized in the armpits .v.</start_of_turn Four of those are cephalic veins, and the broad one is on the outside; people call it "the head vein," and it is a medium vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilica, and another branch of the cephalic; and people call that "the vein of all the body," and basilica is a vein that is stopped in the domestic part, and is called "citellar," and they call that "the belly vein"; funis of the arm, which is stopped over the elbow, and that one in which phlebotomy is performed, and that one that appears on the palm for the sake of appearing manifest; and the ulnar, and it is the vein that is between the thumb and the little finger, and there are two branches in it.</start_of_turn
And in the foot and the thigh there are three veins; one of which is the great saphenous vein, which is on the outside of the ankle; the second is the soleal vein, which is in the outside of the thigh; and the sciatic vein, which is in the outside of the ankle; and in the thigh there are other veins similar to those.</start_of_turn
The help of the veins that are near the ankles is to prevent old catarrh and emigration, swelling and old ulcers of the head that are bad for the ancient times.</start_of_turn
And the quality of bleeding these is as you will recommend to me: that the head of the patient should be calm, and that the head of the patient should be frequent in the occipital region in the place where both veins are wide and well-lubricated; and that you strengthen the patient's neck by placing a bandage around that with which the two veins are close to the ankles in two places below the head; and that you ask the patient to hold their tongue, and if you feel the pulse of those veins ask them to hold their tongue still, here is the sign of the attempt.</start_of_turn
Take the lancet that is acute, which is the inciting one, and insert it outside the vein in the codena until the phlebotomy comes to the bone.</start_of_turn And raise your hand to the vein and the codena to the sides and puncture the vein at the incision point.</start_of_turn And the length of the incision should be the quantity of two fingers adjusted or around that; and do as much as you wish of the antidote as you please.</start_of_turn
And strengthen with powder and leave that until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And already the incision of those and their cauterization has begun.</start_of_turn
May be two veins and arteries that are in the temples contribute to the phlegmatique exhalation of an ancient emanation and so cause bad digestion and excessive sweating of the body.
The quality of phlegmatique exhalation of these is as follows: command the patient to eat little until the two veins appear to swell up at the surface; and when this is shown, know that their cause has been discovered; do not doubt it.</end_of_turn>
Then raise the edge of the coat over the vein to the armpits as I have said before; introduce phlegmatique exhalation from the inside; raise the vein upwards; and make an incision there as you would on the other veins; and do as much scraping as is necessary.</end_of_turn>
Then remove the coat of the patient, and place your hand over the vein for an hour, and place your hand over that coat and dust and strengthen that area so that there is strong constriction, and leave it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And thus the memory of them, and the incision, and the attraction in the beginning is completed.</end_of_turn>
Therefore the phlegmatique exhalation of the vein of the front is similar to the phlegmatique exhalation of the cephalic vein to the ancient diseases of the face and to emigration, dropsy and fetid ulcers.</end_of_turn>
The quality of phlegmatique exhalation of these is as follows: command the patient to tighten their limbs with a belt until the vein appears; then take away the instrument which is called fossori of which this is the form.</end_of_turn
Pause the puncture which is at the head of the fossori over that vein and puncture it either downwards or upwards in the manner of these; and leave the wound to heal according to the quantity you wish; then remove the perforation of the patient and strengthen that area until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Every vein is opened with phlegmatique exhalation, but it does not follow that every phlegmatique exhalation is acute; some are of the remote extremities, and some of the deep parts of the body; as for the rest, the os itself is properly and strongly protected by the surrounding tissues when phlegmatique exhalation is subtle.</end_of_turn
The two veins that are in the temples contribute to the discharge of phlegm from the eyes for scabies of the head and dropsy in the limbs, and to the diseases of the face.</end_of_turn>
The quality of phlegmatique exhalation is that the patient tightens their limbs with a belt, and then phlegmatise those things, and you stand over their head.</end_of_turn
And the phlegmatique exhalation is useful according to the direction from the head to the feet a little bit of phlegm a little bit, for in that place it is not solid; and if the phlegmatique exhalation is subtle, the limb is strongly protected.</end_of_turn
And do as much scraping as is necessary; and pause over those parts and strengthen them for a night, and then remove them.</end_of_turn
The phlegmatique exhalation of the vein of the nose is associated with acute fever and violent sickness, and with the diseases of the face, emigration, dropsy which happen in the face, and especially when it is ancient.</end_of_turn
The quality of phlegmatique exhalation of these is that the patient tightens their limbs and puts their left hand on their nose, and takes subtle phlegmatique exhalation that remains in the middle of the head according to the rectitude, for the vein does not appear to swell up here, and the blood begins to flow freely.</end_of_turn
It must be completed little by little and the blood must be scraped away according to your need; and leave that for a night, for that is restored with delight.</end_of_turn
The phlegmatique exhalation of these two veins contributes to the constriction of the limbs and to the commencement of leprosy and to various diseases, swelling, inflammation, and corrosive ulcers just as in herpes.</end_of_turn
The quality of phlegmatique exhalation of these is that the patient tightens their limbs somewhat with their belt; and keep the instruments over the head of the patient, and let the patient sit on a cushion.</end_of_turn
And do phlegmatise the vein gradually with wide phlegmatique exhalation; and remove the blood in small quantities according to the time or as often as is necessary; and do the same with the other vein.</end_of_turn
And remove the belt and strengthen the two veins with slight tension so that the patient does not feel faint, and leave it like that until the plague is healed.</end_of_turn

If the condition does not manifest itself outwardly, it is necessary to lay the patient on the other side, or to change position, or to search for some limb that is painful; or to feel for the end of the limb, where the pain is most intense. And if you feel pain there, remove that part from the limb as we have said.
If you wish to perform a lymphatic drainage of the limb, then before you tighten the bandage around the limb, place your hand over the area where the pain is most intense; and when you have found the spot, tighten the bandage around the limb as we have said. Keep your hand over the area to prevent excessive pressure.
When you feel a stretching sensation in the limb, the swelling that you have detected in that area is an arterial swelling, and therefore avoid that area.</start_of_turn>
When sometimes during the lymphatic drainage, urine appears in the drainage just like the urine of a child, know that this is the urine of the artery; and that you must keep your hand still over that area for a long time; and when the urine has stopped, if the swelling persists, know that the artery has been cut, and leave that area as it is.</start_of_turn>
Beware of the patient's urine, and do not neglect it for several days until it is healed.</start_of_turn>
If the artery has not been cut, and if you do not find medical assistance at this moment, if you suspect that the artery is affected, tighten the limb; the limb will become rigid and the swelling will disappear. Or take a short incision and open the area that is causing the pain, and take the pulse there until the next day.</start_of_turn
If the artery has been cut, it is useless; otherwise, take care of that part which was previously causing the swelling from which the urine escaped.</start_of_turn
The amputation of the artery is difficult in most cases due to the small size of the wound and the possibility of damaging the limb.</start_of_turn
However, the lymphatic drainage is more useful in extracting the artery from the upper part of the limb up to the lower part of the body; because it is composed of branches from the basilica and branches from the cephalic artery, as we have said.</start_of_turn
Beware of any excessive tension in the lymphatic drainage, because that can be a nerve; and if you puncture the lymphatic drainage and damage the nerve, you will cause it to become numb, and it will be difficult for it to heal. And if the nerve is completely severed, it will not recover at all. In this case, if you see that the nerve is hidden under fat, do not open the lymphatic drainage too deeply, and avoid damaging the nerve.</start_of_turn
If the artery is between two nerves, then cut the artery in its entirety.</start_of_turn
The usefulness of the lymphatic drainage of the cephalic artery is that it extracts the artery from the head and alleviates the pain of the heel.</start_of_turn
Take care of this in the same way, if you want the puncture of the lymphatic drainage to be carried out over the olive or myrtle area; for this is the best way to avoid damaging the artery or nerve.</start_of_turn
It is often observed in fools, when not detected at first percussion, even though they are present.</start_of_turn
The first is that lymphatic drainage should only be performed when there is a possibility of saving the limb and preventing the occurrence of other diseases, and that it should be performed at the beginning of spring, at the end of summer and in the autumn, when there is an apparent accumulation of liquid.</start_of_turn
It should be performed three days before or on the first day after sunset, when three hours have passed since sunrise.</start_of_turn
When lymphatic drainage is performed, it should not cause discomfort or pain, either at night or during the day.</start_of_turn
It should not be repeated within fourteen years, and a woman should not be drained more frequently than once every seven months, and old people should not be drained at all.</start_of_turn
And if someone wants to be flebotomized for any reason, let him modify the belly bulges before the flebotomy at the groin, if there is retained wound there, so that the veins do not pull out the superabundance in the groin of the belly, which are pushed, and that they do not harm the principal members.
Do not flebotomize the patients rashly, neither on account of nausea or vomiting, nor to escape from sickness or drunkenness, except when the former has passed from their body, neither from malaria, nor from any other cause that might dissolve their virtue, or body or animal
And consider carefully in the subtle art of humors whether, if it is possible, the sickness can be overcome with food and drink, or with medicines.
And enter into the bath if any cause does not prohibit, or exert themselves with any exercise so that the sickness is made discreet
And suspend the flebotomy of them in the feet of day, so that it is around the third hour, as we have said
Command that the feet of that person be protected on that day from all accidental injuries, animals or otherwise, such as worry, anger, fear, and all bodily troubles, such as work, excessive drinking, and vice, and everything that may be harmful to them
And with regard to their ailments, let the causes be present in their use according to what is customary among men with aromaticness and odor, and with balsam and the like according to the quantity of possibility.
And follow the flebotomist with a cushion that is thicker than the cushion of that one who must be flebotomized
And remove their arms, and cool that with his hand the flebotomist gives two or three compressions; and tighten the bandage with a cord and cover that with two compressions.
And let the restraint be temperate, for the restraint that is too tight or too loose prevents the flow of the blood; or let it be too soft, and the hours prevent the body of the patient from being relaxed
And when the restraint is complete, let that one who must be flebotomized cool their hands between their thighs until the veins are swollen, and let them be declared by the feeling.
And let the flebotomist take hold of the flesh to be flebotomized with a little oil beforehand; and let him indicate with his left hand that vein, leaving the area where the flebotomy is to be performed, so that the vein escapes a little, and the percussion is calm because it is the vein that has been struck by the cord in the flebotomy, and from those is that it is filled with air and when you stop the flebotomy over that is contracted by the flebotomy, and is discovered by the flebotomist; and the flebotomy does not open the vein, and if it does open, that is stricture.
Therefore, for this reason let the flebotomist be restrained and be solicitous in all these matters
And if the vein is torn in one compression, the hours are not; and if so, repeat that until that place is left a little, or over it is fasted, if that place is not relaxed.
And if that place is relaxed, or the sickness disappears, let the hours leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, for it will cause excessive swelling, or do not enter the bath
And repeat the flebotomy if necessary
And if the opening is small and the blood recovers well, and you fear that the quantity you desire will not be achieved, the hours repeat the flebotomy in that place according to custom and adjust in the opening a little, and do what is called festination until that place is relaxed, for that place is relaxed in many men because of little opening
However, sometimes that is relaxed, the hours do not repeat it, for that is not useful to you in any way; and pause on that every part of the wound of oil, for that relieves the body of the patient. It is better in this place with oil than with the others oils<end_turn>
Similarly administer oil to the wound in all flebotomies where the veins are prohibited from the body of the patient, and make it thick and slimy when it is stopped from one of those over that place, for the blood is subtle and is upset when it is thick.
And if there is generated in the place of the flebotomy great swelling, that many veins have happened, especially if it has not bled until that vein, or in the small opening of the vein, and the hours cover that, and pause on that place a sponge soaked in water and salt, slightly bruised, and tighten that for an hour, for that is dissolved
The blood supply to that limb should be strengthened by means of that vein or another vein.
If it remains in the place for several days, any blackening or greenness will not be noticed; if you wish, cease from that cause of allurement and look at the dissolved mucus, or any cause of thick bile or yellow bile or something similar to these.</end_of_turn>
Move cautiously so as not to cause haematoma or swelling, and evacuate abscesses and swellings by means of incisions.</end_of_turn>
Therefore place your hand over that, and if you find it to be soft, put your compression over that; for that swelling is harmful and bad. And so keep that you have stopped any cause of that which we have said, because strong blood flows from the great artery.</end_of_turn
And apply pressure with that which is astringent, so that the place be hardened, and then take care of that which is left of the other cure until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And extract from the limb according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the color of the vein leaving over the limb as much as appears.</end_of_turn
For if the limb is black, then leave it to become white; in the same way if you see it thick, leave it to become thin; and in the same way if it is acute, leave it until the acuteness has passed.</end_of_turn
And for him who is full and strong who has need of an extraction of a limb at once, let the incisions of the vein be multiplied and let the incisions be large.</end_of_turn
And in him who is pale, do the opposite of that, and extract that limb gradually, and let the wound be straight.</end_of_turn
The best thing in the incisions of the vein is that they be transverse, not punctured.</end_of_turn>
And this manner of incision is saved from the outflow of blood and from the injury of nerves, and is more pleasant and more safe than the incisions according to breadth and length.</end_of_turn
And to which it is customary to happen without fainting, do the incisions, and take care of that before the incisions with a little bit of bread soaked in wine instead of a thousand grains or of coarse salt; and extract from the limb three times or four.</end_of_turn
And if it is cold congestion, before making the incisions, give an infusion of marigold or of honey scented with spices such as cinnamon, ginger or something similar, or in aromatic and fragrant vinegar.</end_of_turn
And if fainting happens, do the incisions, and this is a cause of the lack of blood, then take care that you precede in drinking cold water and fragrant vinegar; and use aromatic herbs and let the patient lie down on that side.</end_of_turn
And use the other causes which we have said in the division on fainting for evacuation.</end_of_turn
And whoever wants to make the limb swell and dissolve the blood according to the season, take care of the incisions from which the evacuation is for, and the virtue of them is cold, which evacuates the blood gradually, as much as according to the quantity of the virtue in the continuous days.</end>
Whoever wants to make the limb swell and keep the blood according to the seasons, and the body is strong, then make the incision close to seven or eight hours from the first incision.</end>
Whoever wants to remove the limb from the body contrary to the side which it descends, take care that it is done on the second or third day.</end
Whoever in the limb in which there is no blood already scalfatised and is acute and causes fever, take care that the blood is evacuated from it in one incision and that a great quantity is evacuated and that the opening is increased until fainting does not happen, for you have preserved all the conditions of the incision; and place your hand over the patient's side, for you must not cause death in place of fainting, for the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.</end
And do not take care when you want to evacuate the limb according to the season, as the orifice of the vein is closed and the blood is difficult to withdraw, for you must precede with that which has been said above and make it extend outwards, for that is too bad.</end
Leave it lying until it is bled according to the method; or remain with the acute pain of the phlebotomy which is clotting of the blood in the vein; or stop on that of tyriaca alum or of alum of sage, and compress that which is light pressure until the blood is outside and sitting.</end
If the vein is clotted, leave it alone and do not touch it until the clot has dissolved.
If it is necessary to evacuate the wound according to the circumstances, and it is not excused, then leave the wound open on that part or in the other limb in another vein.
When the vein called "funis del bras" is swollen in the place of fat or muscle, when it is not obstructed or hidden, that is composed of those things
The quality of the swelling of the limb is that the patient puts their hand in cold water until the heat has gone down and the vein becomes clearly visible
And do the same with the strong thread over that limb and the stricture of the midriff; and do the swelling according to the small transverse, not latitudinally or along the length
And make the opening wide and do the swelling with the one with which you are swelling that over the wrist a little bit
If it is prohibited to flow from the wound, then leave the hand in cold water and let the wound run in the water until you achieve your need.
Even if it were summer days, you are excused from the immersion of the hand in cold water, and the body of the wound is left immersed in cold water at the time of winter.
The swelling of this vein is more beneficial than all the others, because it has neither a pulsating vein nor nerves
The swelling of the heel of the hand is related to the ailments of the feet.
The quality of the swelling of the limb is that you strengthen the hand with the thread or with the hand, because you have put it in cold water, until the vein is swollen and is clearly visible at the same time; and do the swelling that way; and if you put it in that way it will not cause any damage to it
Beware that you do not touch the swelling, because it leaves the nerves of the fingers naked of flesh
And do the same with the hand in cold water and let the wound run in that, because if you do not do the hand in cold water, the wound will coagulate in the orifice of the vein, and it is prohibited to flow
When the wound is extracted according to the quantity of need, then leave your hand over the vein oil and salt, so that it is not solidified too much; and keep it covered so that your hand does not stick to everything
Indeed, the swelling of the left hand is related to the ailments of the belly
And do the same with the swelling of this vein as you did in the other one
The benefit of the swelling of the vein of the heel is for the ailments that are in the lower parts of the body, such as ailments of the belly, and also ailments of the major limbs, and retention of menstruation, and ailments of the tonsils, ulcers of cavities and ancient wounds, and those that remain of ancient ailments
The quality of the swelling of the limb is that the patient puts their whole foot in cold water and makes over that friction until the veins become visible; and they put their hand over the ankle and over the foot so that the area of the vein becomes visible at the same time.
Therefore do the swelling as widely as possible or leave the limb uncovered over the ankle so that the swelling does not adhere to it, because that is better and more salt
And if you swell that part of the foot, then leave your hand over the nerves that are left over that part of the foot, and leave the swelling that you make to pass over that which is as if you were going to prick it
And so be it.
And if it is prohibited to remove the wound; then leave the foot in cold water and let the wound run in that until it is evacuated.
And if the person responsible for the swelling does an error in the first attempt, then do the swelling again a little while later, because the area is salt; and do not be afraid of it, but be careful of the nerves as we have said
And do the same with the other foot as well.
As for the sciatic vein, the place where we said is over the heel of the foot.
The assistance of the flebotomy of the patient is that of an anchor when it is for the healing of the cautery.
The quality of the flebotomy of the patient is that the patient's pain is banished, and that it tightens and strengthens the patient's belly from the groin to the heel of the foot, as far as a long strip of silk that does not appear except for this.
And therefore, when it appears, do the flebotomy according to each case as you are able and according to the traverse, and that is better; or insert it by incision or remove it by excision, because the location of the wound is salt
And it is in most homes not known; and if you find it, and it does not appear with sensation, then do the flebotomy of some limb of it, and that is the one that appears in the two of the foot between the great toe and the little toe
And keep away from nerves, and make run the healing of the quantity you want.
And then remove the tension and place over the location of the flebotomy the coto and strengthen the location, because it is cured with delight.
From the winds and qualities to use of these.
The winds are of barley, or of hemp, or of ivy.
And the winds are beneficial in two ways: one is by sacrifice and extraction of healing, and the other is by wound dressing
And this wound dressing that is by sacrifice is done in two ways, for it is either fire or oil
And to the winds that are administered by sacrifice and extraction of healing are fourteen parts of the body, of which one in which the winds are stopped is the ankle; and the fourth part of the head; and the two parts of the collarbone; and the winds of the chin leave the mandible below the mouth; and the winds of two spatulas; and the winds of alohoster, and is over the heel of the foot; and the winds of two flames; and those of two bras; and the winds of two cavities; and the winds of two cushions
And the winds do not extract the healing except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this they do not take away the power of these; just as in the case of flebotomy; nor does it suffice that the winds be beneficial with fire or oil in any disease that is not suitable for emptying until all the parts of the body are evacuated.
Maybe if necessary, we should provoke the winds for illness or for maintenance, let us administer them at the beginning and at the end of the month, and in the middle of the month and whenever necessary.
And therefore whenever in any case of these, and properly if it is in the third or half of the month, we command that the winds be beneficial more than they have passed for two or three hours.
And the assistance of the winds of the neck is that when they confer to gravity in the head and to what is effaced to the knees; more than that it is that it should be a close evacuation of all the body parts
And this wind is in the place of the cephalic flebotomy
It is not lawful for anyone who is of sluggish temperament or in whom there is congestion, because it gives great harm to him.
And for this it does not suffice that these things be used in the old people, and in the heads of those in whom there are fiery diseases.
More to that, whoever continues to do this about it is beneficial oblivion; and for this you must command the wind-healer to stop his hand a little with the wind towards the heels, fearing the generation of oblivion.
And the winds of alkehel are in the place of the flebotomy of the jugular and basilica veins: and for this they confer to asthma, and to constriction of bile and to the scissura of the bile spasm, and to cough, and to replacement
The air must be slightly warm and dry, for if it is too still, it produces weakness in the body and the stomach.
The air movement from ambergdahan brings relief to head and eye pain, and also expels wind, fever, and toothaches; this is better than applying blistering plaster.</end_of_turn>
And let the wind blower know that he must not put his hand too close to the scarification, for he might obstruct the artery and cause blood flow to cease.</end_of_turn>
The dry air helps to soothe hiccups in the throat, corruption of the gums, and the sensation of disease in the mouth, and is better than applying an ointment for food that is in the armpits.</end_of_turn
Better is the dry air that is useful on the armpits, for it brings relief from chills.</end_of_turn>
The air coming from the armpits towards the head brings relief to the three veins, that is the basilica, jugular and cephalic, for all the smaller veins that are in the flesh depend on these three veins.</end_of_turn
And command the wind blower not to proceed too far in the scarification, for the area is stripped of flesh, and leave the nerves and arteries exposed.</end_of_turn
The air is one that has been blown over ash and brings relief to the swellings of the heel and the ulcers that are left behind.</end_of_turn>
And let the wind blower be a strong wind, and that it be of the east, for the area cannot endure a strong dry wind; and let the wound be made with a sharp scarifier.</end_of_turn
The greatest winds from the lower parts of the body manifest minimally, for they take away all the blood of the body, and bring relief to ancient pains of the lungs and belly, and of the bladder; and they cause menstruation, and bring relief to swelling and swelling of the abscesses.</end_of_turn
However, they do not benefit the whole body and cause nausea in many people.</end_of_turn
And the drying winds bring relief for the most part thanks to the drying winds of the lower parts of the body.</end_of_turn
The quality of the position of the winds is that it stops the wind at the beginning of the treatment and lets it subside slowly, and does not prolong the position of the winds, but rather suspends them for a while, and lets the humors reach the area immediately for healing.</end> And do not stop until you see the area already bruised and swollen and that the redness of the blood appears.</end_of_turn
And when you have finished scarifying and have repeated the suctions a few times, then consider the condition of the body.</end_of_turn
For the person who has soft and delicate flesh, command that you make a slight scarification and do not proceed too far, for the area should not be ulcerated.</end_of_turn
And command the wind blower to widen the scarification and let out a little air, and to do the suctions easily.</end_of_turn
If there is thickness in the wound, then command that you make two slight incisions, for in the first incision you open the passage of the subtiliation to the blood and the moisture of the wound.</end_of_turn And in the second incision the acquisition of the extraction of the thick blood.</end_of_turn
And if the wound is not bloody, then command that you make the third incision for the purpose of achieving the blood.</end_of_turn
And finally, when you want to extract the blood a little at a time or a little, suffice with a slight scarification.</end_of_turn
And if you want to extract a lot of blood, make a large scarification; and if you know that the blood is thick, then command that you make a wide scarification.</end_of_turn
The end of the scarification is only the depth of the puncture.</end_of_turn
And if the person from whom the puncture is to be made has large, hard, dry, and rough flesh, command that the area around the wound be lubricated with softer substances; if it is in summer, thus with olive oil of aloes or violets, or almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then olive oil of marjoram, or oil of lily, or chamomile oil, or saffron oil.</end_of_turn
If the excess is great, cold, the hour suggests either ammonia, or oil of balsam, or oil of aloes, or oil of anethi, and so on.
If the windward side is of great extent of tender rind, the hour advises that oil should not be used, and that at these locations the winds of the area should be washed away with water or cold water of the sun, or with vinegar, or with lime juice, or with vinegar of boric acid, and so on.</end_of_turn>
And concerning that of which it is said that there is moisture, wash away its winds with wine vinegar, or with water of myrtle, and mastic and so on.</end_of_turn>
And concerning that of which the excess is great, wash away its winds with wine vinegar, or with juice of elderberry, which is greater, or with decoction of anethi, or of chamomile, and so on.</end_of_turn>
And it is necessary that the windward side should be protected from the bath; having said that, it should be administered at a distance of an hour or two from the bath, and that it should be placed over the windward side.</end_of_turn>
What should be done so that the windward side recover from phlebotomy before the ventosation?</end_turn>
Consider at the beginning: if the windward side or that from which the phlebotomy is being done is bilious and vents over it is acute and inflamed, the hour advises that you should anticipate cold causes, thus as many as a thousand vinegar and urine, and barley, and rosemary, and thyme, and so on.</end_turn
And suspend their diet thus as poultry, and boiled meats of fish, and dishes seasoned with vinegar, and so on.</end_turn
And concerning that of which the complexion is cold, it is necessary to anticipate the use of warm baths, or bath of aloe seeds and mastic, and chamomile, and fragrant vinegar; and that it be recommended to take little wine and to eat little, and to abstain from poultry and meat and fish and peas and mushrooms.</end_turn
And it is necessary that in the day of the windward side and of the phlebotomy, the wine should be greater than the food.</end_turn
And it is necessary that in a certain number of hours after dinner, at breakfast or other meals, some strong medicine such as musk, or marjoram, or alum before the windward side or before the phlebotomy or at the same time, so that the principal limbs are comforted and that the body is soothed; and do not take any baths.</end_turn
If the winds that are being sacrificed are to be great, let them be winds that cover the heel and the ankle, and the navel, in the places of the joints, and the armpit of the armpits, so that these members do not suffer from sacrifice upon them.</end_turn
And it is not desired for these except for the attraction of the sanctity of a limb, thus as it stops the wind over the breast in the disease of flux of blood from the breast; and use this for that so that the cold wind be dissolved from the limb, thus as over the belly and the navel; for that will soften the limb and heal the wound that the wind causes.</end_turn
And so it is stopped over the joints when it coincides with their boiling or putrefaction, for by the attraction of a strong heat they consume the boiling and expel the pus from its place.</end_turn
And in the same way it is done when it is stopped over the heel and the ankle, you must remove the wind from those enclosed spaces.</end_turn
These winds are administered cold with vinegar only; and some vegetables are administered with fire.</end_turn
Some vegetables are administered full of cold water in the diseases of the breast.</end_turn
And this is because the wind should be full and greater, so it is cold water alone or water in which herbs are boiled as is convenient.</end_turn
Form of wind administered with fire: the breadth of the orifice of two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and the quantity of resin is that of a palm; and be on the side of the limb, in the place that is in the circuit, the palm of the limb, the thumb is small according to the quantity that enters it with a needle.</end_turn
Whether it is fat of marrow or citrus, of orange peel, lion, ivy or viper for that it does not freeze the limb from its position on it.</end_turn
And at the middle of it make a transverse incision of marrow or iron, where a candle is placed with the fire.</end_turn
And indeed this great wind is more potent than the one we recommended; and the little rest that remains according to the illnesses and the condition of the patient who uses it.
And the winds of the elderly and those that stretch out are greater than those of the young and robust people.</end_of_turn>
And the quality of stopping this wind is that you extend the flame over the limb by means of a decent amount of resin, and place that over the middle of the transverse arch of the foot, where the wind is, so that the flame is kindled around the outside so that it does not burn the body of the patient.</end_of_turn>
And indeed keep your hand over the limb of the patient, and say what we have said, because when they have the wind and do not demand that we say it, and when the vapor escapes from that wound, the wind becomes so dissipated.</end_of_turn
And do the same with the flame according to its manner, and repeat that if you do not desire it.</end_of_turn>
More in the wind that is administered in the disease of gout, with water, in which there is neither transverse arch nor wound, and which is not administered except when it is full of water, and is kept only over the limb.</end_of_turn>
And this is its way: And this wind, the greater it is, the better, because it receives a great quantity of water.</end_of_turn
The text ends here.</start_of_turn>
Bloodletting is not administered in all limbs but in the limbs in which it is not possible to place a wind, because of their small size, as well as with the thumb and little finger; or in a limb devoid of flesh, as it is said of the nose and ear, and in such a case.</end_of_turn
And the quality of using those which you have found bloodletting in the deep veins of the buttocks is that they are in muddy waters.</end_of_turn
And indeed they are left lying down day and night in muddy water until they become faint; and that no other cause remains in their belly; and that you evacuate the body in the beginning with a purge and with winds; and that you cool the limb of the patient until it turns red; and that you keep them stopped.</end_of_turn
And as they are full and lazy.</start_of_turn
And if it is possible to drain the area with the wind, it is better behind in usefulness.</start_of_turn
And if not, then indeed wash the area with warm vinegar and add some powder; and wet and wring out.
And if the course of the treatment is prolonged, indeed put on a sponge of lead in cold water, and keep that over until the discharge has stopped.</start_of_turn
And if the disease is multiplied, indeed sprinkle over them powdered vitriol, or urine and remain with them from the restrictive causes until the disease is cured; or keep them stopped over the area the mastiles of scraped saffron, and keep them there until the saffron adheres to the area, and the disease is cured.</end_of_turn
And so, if necessary, repeat the bloodletting, when possible change them.</start_of_turn
And if bloodletting is prohibited from suspension, indeed wet the area of the disease recently or leave a needle in the area until the disease has healed; and keep them stopped, because they cause pain when any disease is felt so much as is necessary.</start_of_turn
And when you wish them to rest, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloe, or salt, or ash, and cover them all.</start_of_turn
Thus ends the third part: restoration.</start_of_turn> This chapter is very useful for the art of medicine; and is the restoration of fracture and dislocation of bones.</start_of_turn
Oh, son of you doctors, vulgars and those who at this time do not remember the ancients or do not read their letters.</start_of_turn
And for this reason it is useful that this art of medicine is private in our land; and I have not forgotten it at any time; and I have not acquired it from anyone, but by reading the books of the ancients and studying to understand them, until I have extracted the science from them.</start_of_turn
And I direct it to experience and study throughout my life.</start_of_turn
And thus I have described in this chapter all that I have learned about this matter and about which I have experience; for I have abridged what I have said to you others and delivered you from the burden of long discourse; and I have opened up in the end of the abbreviation; and I have shown you in the end of the declaration; and I have formed in this matter various forms of the pangs that are administered in this case, just as it is done in addition to the declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
Summary and collections from this fracture of bones, from which the previous preface is necessary, before we begin to recall the fractured limbs and various if each one. Therefore we shall speak in this chapter of the sums of the speech; and the chapters to the understanding of which at the beginning are forced by the artificer and placed upon the truth of those things; so is you and those who know or learn this noble art from you.
And therefore I say that when accidents happen to an arm fracture or dislocation or twist or otherwise, the hour covers that you should immediately apply a cold compress or allay to that, or whatever helps, if you do not prohibit any cause, just as from duty of virtue, or that which happens to a child, or an old man in decrepitude, or is a time of violent heat, or violent cold.
And thus be content in food with fresh herbs and boiled meats of calves and crabs; and prohibit large meats and fill if of foods and of all food that fills the veins of sanctity, until you are sure of postoperative caution, and if you do not fear the escape of matter from the limb
And the hour returns the patient to their first place where they usually lie.
And therefore when the fractured bone begins to be restored, the hour covers that the patient should not be given nourishing foods of great size and difficulty in which there is viscosity, just as are foods made of wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads, and fish, and beef tripe, and oats, and eggs, and fresh peas, and large bread and things similar to these, and in this regimen is useful the coagulation of the fracture more quickly and gently
And you know that bones break when they are in the homes that are in the first vigor and in the decrepit, it is not possible that they be continued and be consolidated according to their nature by the dehydration of their limbs
May be, however, nature adjusts and remembers about the fractured bone from all parts whatever cause is similar to glue in which it is thickness that adheres and strengthens that which until it is taught to adhere and join together, until it comes to the end of stiffness and rest, just as at the beginning of the heat, until any cause does not prohibit that from its works.
And for this reason it is necessary to rest the patient's food, food in which there is gravity and viscosity and thickness, as we have said
And you know that the species of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for the fracture of the bone of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the head; and the fracture of the bone of the foot is different from the fracture of the bone of the forearm; and in the same way all the others are diverse among them
And I recall from all the species of fracture, exposed in the separate chapter distinct from the other
Many different fractures in their very essence.<end_turn> And they are diversified the species of fracture of the bone in their very essence; for it is a useful fracture arched another that occurs in their stars; and some fractures are useful according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the hip and ankle and wrist, which originate from causes that do not originate, just as it is in the penalty when it is prepared to write, and is a fracture with plaque and disruption in the head, and is a minor fracture fissure.
And in all species there is a peculiar remedy or pain in the restoration according to what will be remembered in the distinct places.
A sign of bone fracture. And for this it is known that there is a fracture of the bone: it is tortures of the limb, and from that eminence and appearance of the limb to the feeling, and so of it when you press it with your hand
And therefore when it is not in the place apparent torture or when it is not believed to be there, do not touch it when you touch the bone with agitation and the patient does not find great pain, the hour is not here a fracture
It is possible that there is either pain or a slight fracture, whereupon you should not move your hand or compress it; there should be rest from the medicines which are appropriate at that moment in that place; and it should be strictly bound.
And you know that when the limb is bent and is not fractured into two or otherwise that it does not suffer serious damage, as when the whole part is carefully moved, the hour covers that you begin to rectify it immediately when it happens afterwards
And if it happens afterwards with the cautery, the hour leaves it for a few days until the swelling subsides; and at the same time it supports that according to any manner that can be lifted and supported
And you know that the restoration and swelling of the limb is lighter than the bone in which the fracture has occurred
And so do what will remind you of that moment
More so, if there is a fracture in the bone, the hour is necessary to extend this limb broken from two parts, whether it is the hand or the foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or one string and the hand.
And your position should be such that you place the limb loosely according to its natural figure, while the broken parts are extended from the limb; the hour teaches you that you must return those after-effects with support and in any way you can manage in their places
And keep yourself according to your force that you do not cause further pain to the patient by your operation or injury; and teach you how to apply one bone with the other so that they are companions in various forms for a thousand hours.
And you cover that in that hour you take advantage of your touch with your hand, and if sometimes there is any other cause, rectify that and support that for the amount of your virtue.
Forgive violent stretching and compression, just as foolish doctors do who make the after-effects of the cautery worsen by their operation, or who make the limb contract as they have seen with the operation of their patients.
And the quality of the stricture of the limb is that which I recommend; for you know that broken limbs are diverse in their smallness and greatness and in the form of those.
And of those which are small like the arm and the finger and the toe and similar to those, the hour teaches you that the covering should be of soft material.
And those which are large like the thigh or the chest, cover that it should be a solid and hard covering, because the strong ligament that connects the great limb with the strong limb sustains that from all parts with equal strength, without causing any bruising
And so I say, do the evacuation of the wound, pause the convenient ligament at the place of that fracture with three coverings or four as the limb deserves; and strengthen your hand a little bit on the ligament.
And so I say, look at the most elevated part of the place of the fracture, and strengthen less than that where you have strengthened the limb of the fracture And so I say, lengthen the covering of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the stricture little by little, until you have taken away a large part of the limb
And so I say, take another bandage and cover that wound over the broken limb with the covering; and look at the coverings at the furthest part of the fracture; and your operation is in the stricture of the covering and in the softening of that as we said in the first covering
And so I say, rest between the positions of stopping a lion or a bear which is equal to the pain of the fracture, if there is pain; and if not, do not rest in any case.
And so I say, rest over the other bandage, and cover over these coverings adequately made so that if there is no swelling or after-effect of the cautery in the limb, the hour rests over that until the swelling has gone down; and leave that for a few days; and the hour strengthens over them again
And if it is of the greatest importance to form the staple in a skillful manner; or if it is of the foot; or of palm-shaped; let the width of each staple be in accordance with this form and this figure.
However, the staple that is placed over that fracture must be larger and thicker than the others, and its length must be according to the magnitude and smallness of the limb; and in addition to that, strengthen the staple with another object according to your first instruction; and finally, secure it firmly in place according to what has been said of the instruction, and that it is the staple itself that must be placed in the most suitable place of the fracture, and as long as the fracture is prolonged, it is better to make the staple longer.</end_of_turn>
And it must be covered that the threads are somewhat thicker in diameter and more flexible, and that they are of linen; and if the threads are too long, just as I have seen in the operation of the fracture of the forearm, leaving the threads of cordage twisted, is a great error, when the staple comes out equal.
And the very fine threads are not convenient, because you will not be able to secure the staple with them at those which you wish; and it must not be that there be less than a finger's width between the staple and the staple
And if the patient is like this for the ends of the staples, then stop leaving those stopa leon or lanas inside until they do not cause him damage.
Some doctors consider it like a plague, and an accident of disruption of the corden; and I remember that in this chapter it has been said of the singularity
And know that every fractured limb is not immediately stable with the staples on the first day; the cause of which is that when the limb is large, it does not suffice to rest on it with the staples but rather after a few days or seven or eight, according to your estimate of the progress of recovery from the wound
This is the way in which the ancients restored the fractures, which were placed over fractures, dislocations and sprains.
Method of plastering as a method of fracture restoration, convenient for many complex and majorly for the legs and arms, because of which concerning this one does not suffer heat or cold: and take from the flour dust, and this is the marrow of the wheat that hangs between the layers of the flour.
And if it is convenient, so be it; but if it is in an egg of liquid, stop the setting of it not too thick or too thin; and use that one.</start_of_turn>
Another way of plastering is for fracture, dislocation and twist: recipe of asafetida, of lapdanum, of acacia, of enula, and marigold, which is ground from a thousand grains of gold; of mirra and aloes one dram; of aloes two drams. All these are powdered and sifted and mixed with water with oil or with egg white if the patient's wound is raw; and use this plaster, which is of good composition and restores the broken bones pleasantly, and gives comfort to many people.</end_of_turn>
Another way of plastering which gives comfort for fracture and twist: recipe marigold and white alum at one dram; of mirra and aloes at one dram; of acacia at two drams; of linseed at three drams.
All of these are ground in a mortar with a stone container, and are crushed, and are mixed with water or with an egg of liquid and be administered.</start_of_turn
Method of plastering for joints and separated bones from their place, and when there is pain in those and in fissures and fractures: take a fine thread and immerse it in vinegar and oil cooked and put it on the area.</start_of_turn
In this plaster there is no virtue of restoration, of healing of the wound and it expels pain properly.</start_of_turn
Another method of dressing that restores the fracture: take alder leaves of fig tree and leaves of poppyseed; mix them together and make a dressing of them.
A shortened method of dressing that is administered alongside the restoration of the fracture of bones and when you wish to resolve the residue of inflammation: mix together rue, chamomile and violet flowers, oatmeal flour, all in equal parts.</end_of_turn> Mix them all thoroughly and moisten them with wine, if the limb is not scorched.</end_of_turn>
If it is scorched, however, do moisten it with water of columbine or water and use it.</end_of_turn
Another method of dressing which is stronger in resolving this latter, when an abscess is present alongside the restoration of the limb: mix together rue and linseed seeds, barley, meadowsweet, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all in equal parts and poppyseed; mix them all thoroughly and moisten them with vinegar or other liquid or wine, as you consider appropriate according to the quality of the limb and the severity of the color of it.</end_of_turn>
Ipocras does not declare in his book that it is appropriate to leave the limb open without supporting it alongside the restoration of the limb except for the purpose of applying wax and oil; and it is recommended that you keep it between thickness and thinness.</end_of_turn
However, in Gaul it is seen that it is appropriate to support the limb alongside the restoration of the limb and the causes of excessive heat are small calidity so as to be like myrrh, incense and the like of those causes which we have recommended.</end_of_turn
A method of dressing that brings comfort to the lesion and pain: mix grated nutmeg, cloves, bruised parsley leaves or pennyroyal leaves, rue, salt, equal parts; mix them all thoroughly, sift them and moisten them, and make a dressing.</end_of_turn
However, the quantity according to which you should cover the ligament should be such that you consider neither too little nor too much pain, nor if the bone is not fractured not to cause more pain. In this case, do not remove the dressing for many days.</end_of_turn And if suddenly the area experiences violent pain or swelling or inflammation, then you should quickly remove the dressing at that moment and keep the dressing on it.</end_of_turn
And take a sponge of linen and sea sponge dipped in lukewarm water, and wet that with vinegar; and with that wash the area until the swelling and pain cease; then place a bandage over the area for an hour; and then place over it a cloth soaked in strong vinegar and olive oil or olive oil with rosemary, and bind over it for a night until you are sure that the abscess has drained, and that the swelling of the limb has subsided, and that the pain has ceased.</end_of_turn
And repeat this restriction loosely and make the dressing smaller and do not tighten it too much for your initial constriction, and withdraw it when it is well.</end_of_turn
And if sometimes the abscess, swelling, pain and inflammation and all these ailments have already subsided, and digestion of the dressing and restriction has begun, then repeat that in this way as you did at the beginning when you started the healing process.</end_of_turn
And if no other cause related to those which we have mentioned has occurred in the limb, then do not remove the dressing until three or four or five or seven days.</end_of_turn and as many as maintain that it should be left for xx days according to your judgement for the healing of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture has healed, and when the blood clot has formed over that.</end_of_turn
And adjust in the restriction more than in your initial restriction throughout, and adjust in the digestion of the patient's food, following the recollection of it.</end_of_turn
However, if sometimes the limb dries out and contracts more than it was covered, then you must know that food is prohibited for that; and therefore give him lukewarm water instead of food for the entire period of the treatment; and do it for three days; and slightly loosen the restriction for this operation to be able to provide the limb with nourishment, and it will recover pleasantly.</end_of_turn
However, what the doctors do in the restoration of the limb after it has been fractured is another folly when it is not restored at the beginning, as they do with torment, and it is a great fear, and if they were more discreet they would make the ailments worse in their freedom and would be worse off with it.</end_of_turn
And I have never seen anyone do that, for it is more reasonable that they do not do it.</end_of_turn>
Capitol segon: Of fracture when it happens in the head.
Species of fractures are many, and their figures are diverse, and their causes are different, for every fracture is caused by percussion of space, and percussion hinders all the bones within the cavity, which remains in the limb, as it happens in the forearm, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called fracture of the bone; or the space penetrates any part of the bone, and penetrates the marrow of it, but does not pass through to the back of the bone; and this kind of fracture is called complete fracture.
And the plague of these two fractures is great or little, and of a fracture that is contracted or contained; and the cause of it is percussion with a blunt object or sometimes with a sharp object, and it persists.
And this fracture is penetrating which already approaches the canal which is left in the limb; or it is in the face of the bone, and the plague of these two fractures is great or little.
And the fracture is that which is hidden in the bone, in the marrow of the small vessel, and for this reason this kind of fracture is called capillary fracture.
And the fracture is caused by blow or by chance or by percussion of stone and it persists, which makes enter every lamina of the bone to the parts around it, and is caused in the hollow part just as when it happens in the bones of the forearm when it is struck by percussion and a part of it enters the parts around it.
And most of all it is caused in the bones of soft parts, as for example the heads of the bones of the fingers and toes
And thus of all these types of fractures, these are masses just like separate stars. And I come to remember all this in this place.
And I know all these kinds of fractures by recognition on them and for their inquiry in order to attempt them and to establish the corruption of marrow which is upon them.
And the capillary fracture is known because it is discovered on the bone, and it is excised, and it limits itself with a tension, which makes the fracture appear black
Maybe in the treatment of fracture one must take into consideration at the beginning the signs of illness, and when sometimes for the signs that signify for significance appear regarding fear, such as vomiting of bile, extension, loss of understanding, loss of voice, syncope, and acute fever, and if these signs are accompanied by swelling and pain in those parts, despite all these precautions, it is not healthy.
And if sometimes non-current accidents happen to you, you hope for health, the hour you begin the treatment of them
The cause is that if it is revealed to you at the beginning like it is revealed and that is in the days of spring, the hour you must study the bone marrow giving the day fourteen according to all custom
And if it is in the days of summer, the hour you must hide the bone marrow giving the seventh day, having understood that what remains of the bone is corrupted from the canal, and that these signs accompany these accidents which we have recommended
And if the fracture has already reached the canal covering the brain, and is split into small fragments and contained, the hour you must insert the split fragment and bind it, as I recommend to you.
And that you take the head of the disease which is plagued, and discover about the bone as it is customary and handle it as you are able according to the figure of the plague, and that you are curious about the disease.
And if it happens to you that you discover the fracture, flux of blood of cautery, the hour you oppose it with what you can and what covers it, that you cover the place with clean linen soaked in oil and vinegar, and make the plague rest until the cautery is sedated; and be sure to flux blood of the sanctuary; and start from the circumference of the bone and from its ablation
And this is according to two methods of operation.
And one of the methods is that you insert the bone with a straight incision like this: And then you administer another incision which is a little wider than the first; and this is like this:
And you administer more of the latter incision than the former
And cover that you must give your name of various incisions, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others and are in the back of the acuity of their extremities, and they are of iron or steel.
Use their hands to facilitate percussion over the sensitive area so that you do not damage the head and cause further damage.
If the swelling is strong and firm, then pierce the circumference of the limb giving an injection at the same time, for which the unguents are named superficial.
They are not called thus unless the bone at the end is close to that which is left with the head of the limb like a margin or a small circle, which must not be immersed in liquid or subjected to pressure
It is convenient that you take a great number of these injections, since in all tests of the brain and limbs which are acute, the quantity in length and breadth should be in proportion to the quantity of spiciness of that test
This is the form of three injections: The quality of perforating in the circumference of the fractured bone is that you pause the injection on the bone and rotate that around the toes until you know that the bone has already been penetrated; and then exchange the injection to another place and stop when there is between too much of the thickness of the ray or when the surrounding area is affected.
And so inject around the bone where there is a fracture, making that which remains over the surrounding area more fluid than before, as we have said, until the bone is eradicated, or with your hand, or by any other cause which may produce swelling, such as splinters and fine forceps.</start_of_turn>
Take care that the injection does not touch any cause of swelling.</start_of_turn>
Therefore when you have pierced the circumference of the bone, and if you continue without separating it from the swelling, then extract that which is outside, keep that which is inside wet with something like the injection, but make sure that it is more solid and more fluid than the others.</start_of_turn
And if there remains any small pieces of bone and fragments, then take that out with ease using water which will soften the pain; and then take care of the wound with lint and ointment as we have said.</start_of_turn
And another way of operating is light, long and laborious, which is to dissect the heel and the ankle for a great wound; and this is its name: it is necessary at the beginning to discover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and most obvious, until when you have discovered that part and have stopped leaving the limb of that injection slow and easy from which this is the form:
And that the flat part is lean and does not touch any cause, and the acute part is of it in two slopes forward in length, as sometimes; that the flat part should be adjusted to the swelling with the face of it which is incident acutely on the bone.</start_of_turn
And so puncture the injection with a little mallet so that you can put all the bone in easily as it is rotated, and you must be sure that there is no risk of causing an accident in any way, and if the physician is the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant, certainly he will sleep.</start_of_turn
If there remains any attached cause to the bone of the ankle or in the place of bones, puncture that with the limb of the injection that is flat, and deliver that with ease, for it is loosened from it without documents and without fear.</start_of_turn
If the bone is not penetrated within the ankle, and that which is broken or remaining of the bone is the face of it, and remains in the swelling and fragments, then take that out with fine instruments as you have prepared, in various quantities so that you can manage to administer them in all places with the greatest convenience and the most gentleness of those that you can lose in that operation that broken bone and the figure of it.</start_of_turn
And take care that you administer at the beginning of these quantities the most liquid of those quantities, and use a little of the solid of them, and do not stop until you have administered the most solid and the most fluid of all.</start_of_turn
But in any other small fractures of the capillaries and subtle fractures, take care that you administer with care according to what you find to be the right cure.</start_of_turn
And it is known by all those who have studied in this art.</start_of_turn And so we have shown in great fractures.</start_of_turn>
If the ankle is rectangular when you extract the bone, then take hold of it according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse that in olive oil, and place that over the orifice of the wound; and take another cloth doubled or tripled and immerse it in wine and olive oil and place that over the thumb and do to the pus whatever you please that can come over that, without injuring it; and administer over that ligament flat, and do not strain that until the wound is alone.</start_of_turn
Leave him thus for a day or two until you are certain the cautery has ceased; then remove it and administer medicines which are superfluous in such cases, thus as salt of lin and oatmeal, powdered herbs, and of enses and aristologia, and like those.
And thus, sprinkle these medicines finely over the wound, thus as when they are dry; and generally give all medicines of such qualities as will not irritate or harm.</end_of_turn>
Beware lest the wound in your care become inflamed; neither add grease or any other substance to it; neither let it be exposed to excessive heat; for when it is applied to the cavity of the brain, it corrupts that and brings about death, and causes the patient great harm.</end_of_turn>
When it is applied to the head cavity, as when the bone is toughened and especially when the care is scanty, and is black on the surface; therefore take heed lest it cause harm to the patient, for that is perilous in every way.</end_of_turn
If it does not cause blackness from the medicine that has been discontinued, and is in virtue of that medicine that caused that blackness, then take a little of that medicine and olive oil in parts three to one.</end_of_turn And thus apply a bandage, and place that over the cavity; and care for that which accords with the nature of the wound until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
End of document.</end_of_turn>
Restoration of the nose when it is fractured.</end_of_turn>
Beware that the nose is not fractured but merely displaced so that two bones remain, for the separated part is cartilaginous and is not fractured, but is softened and twisted and swollen.</end_of_turn
If indeed one of the two parts is fractured, then you must introduce a little support into the nose, and bind that fracture with the said thread and with the said bandage, until the nose returns to its natural shape.</end_of_turn And thus it is well that you should facilitate this, and keep that you do not cause excessive pain for the patient during this operation.</end_of_turn>
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and you say that is not for this, then keep the height equal to the extremity of the ray where the thickness is small.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture is in two parts, you must make it resemble the above.</end_of_turn
Cover the restoration of the nose in the first day of the fracture if possible; otherwise, keep it still for six days or until the cautery has subsided.</end_of_turn
And put on the extremity of the nose a bandage of lint, if the fracture is in one part, or two cushions, if the fracture is in two parts, and the cushion should be of such thickness as to fill the cavity of the nose.</end_of_turn
Tell the former restorers that the cushions should be bound over, and should be changed every day, though I do not see it; it must be that the bandage should be fixed with album of glue as with powdered rosin; and that you leave the bandage in place until the bone is fixed and the cartilage is hardened.</end_of_turn
And some people put sponges inside the nose instead of a cushion, because it is softer than the cushion of lint; and that the nose is already so inflamed that it is not prohibited from inspiration.</end_of_turn
This is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do so, and if you wish, do not.</end_of_turn
And if another sponge comes loose after the cautery, plaster the nose with cerate or pitch infused in wine vinegar and olive oil, or with alum.</end_of_turn
If it does not come loose after the cautery, keep it plastered with flour and powdered herbs mixed with glue of gum; and place your hand over it to stop the bleeding, and do not touch the nose in any way.</end_of_turn
If the bones of the nose are fractured with a slight fracture or deformity, then you must cut away those, and extract them with the instruments that are appropriate for those; and close the wound, and care for that which is inflamed and consolidated, and do so as necessary.</end_of_turn
And if there is swelling in the nose due to the cautery, then care for that with cushions and administer lead tubes until it is completely healed.</end>

Restoring the jaw when fractured.</end_of_turn>
When the jawbone is fractured and the fracture is not immediately painful, treat it only if it is displaced, and not if it is fractured in two and bent outwards.
Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and in the same way, if the fracture is on the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand; and push down with the other hand on the area of the fracture outwards, and hold the other hand over that area.
If the fracture of the jawbone is already separated into two, then cover that you administer traction of two parts according to the rule until it is possible to equalize them.</end_of_turn>
If by chance there is displacement of teeth with disruption, strengthen those which you think will remain in place with gold or silver or gutta percha; and place your hand over the fractured jawbone, and place your hand over the duplicate tooth, and place your hand over the large bone nearby in a suitable place; and bind them up as is usual in such cases until the ligature is complete and the application is in place, until it is not destroyed.</end_of_turn>
Command the patient to rest and tranquility, and abstain from eating fatty foods.</end_of_turn
And if you see that the figure has already been altered in any way, cover it up and remove it on the third day; and then rectify what has already been altered from it and cover it with powder of mill, albumin or oatmeal, because you have not finished with it yet, and place your hand over the plaster bandage.</end_of_turn
And when it is fixed and adjusted that plaster over it, and the condition of the bone is not altered, leave it like that, do not remove it until it is healed and the fracture is strong; for if you remove it before that, the fracture will be stretched in three segments.</end_of_turn
And if another wound occurs later on, cover it up as we have said in the case of pain, until it is healed, and remove that wound.</end_of_turn
And if the fracture is painless, consider whether it is a broken bone or displaced fragments, for in this case I order you to remove those fragments with what is convenient in the removal of those that cause the pain.</end_of_turn
And if the wound is wide, expand it with the forceps according to the amount of your need.</end_of_turn
And when you have finally removed those fragments, and those that you did not remove remain, cover the wound if it is wide; or if not, place one of the plasters that you consider convenient over it and bind that, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Restoring the jaw when fractured, for the fifth time.</end_of_turn
Restoring the jaw when fractured.</end_of_turn
A fracture of the jaw is usually caused by injury to the teeth in front of the muscle, and that fracture is made in three ways.</end_of_turn
Because either it is fractured, or displaced, or is displaced into two parts without causing fragments; and the restoration of it is difficult; or because there has occurred displacement of fragments, and it is difficult to restore them; or because the fracture is painless.</end_of_turn
And in that operation, when the fracture is painless, two assistants are necessary, so that one holds the fractured jaw and the other extends the collar over that part.</end_of_turn
And bandage the fracture with the fingers inside until the shape is restored according to what is covered, and not too high or too low.</end_of_turn
If you require more extension, cover that you stop the tingling of the patient's lip hopes for thread or gauze, and the size of it according to the amount of your need; and extend and elevate the jaw and hold it with your hand until the fracture is bound according to what is covered.</end_of_turn
If you cannot pull the limb of the jaw outwards towards the outside, for fear of causing a displacement, cover that the patient should lie on his chest, and place your hand over the muscle of it a cushion of moderate size.</end_of_turn
And the assistants hold the muscle of it towards the outside until the jawbone is elevated higher than it is in the preon, and then you can rectify the fracture and bandage it with the fingers inside.</end_of_turn
May it be that even if you feel satiety from the spur of the fork and your mood is gloomy, the hour demands that you take off from that and extract those satiety matters with ease.
If it is retained in the bones, the hour necessitates incision of them with one of the instruments you have prepared for this, because you have left the fork inside which causes torment to the stomach; and that torment is of the kind that comes from a wound or from iron, of which this is the form
It is like a wound of which this is the cavity; and its breadth according to what you need of it, according to the size of the bone or the thinness of it.
The length of it should be as much as possible for the operation; that there be two extremities thus at times, and one wide and the other narrow
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you have extracted the satiety from the bone is wide, and you are sure of the closure, the hour adjusts the two lips of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is slight, or you fear closure with the cautery, the hour will use the wound with gauze and powders according to the quantity of the wound
And if the closure with the cautery should happen, the hour inflates the area with vinegar and olive oil and wine, and rests upon it.<end_turn>
And all this, that the sponge does not slip from the fractured bone; and so that you can see the pain every day, for when it is softened or when the sponge has already become softened, the hour will rectify this and strengthen the bandage
And finally, prevent the patient from sleeping on the pain over the area, and keep their feet elevated during the night a small cushion; so that at that time the support of the area is raised at the level of the muscle; or that the arm is bound to the area at the level of the area.
Do not remove the bandage if it does not happen in the place or with closure, within twelve days.
And renew the plaster if you have seen the surface of the wound at that time, and adjust the stiffness and restore that which was restored until it is restored and the fracture of the ankle is coagulated
And it is strong and comfortable according to the month in eighty days, and some women are healed in a month of time from that.

Treatment of ankle fracture.
The ankle bone is fractured in the lateral area and is not fractured at the edges.
And therefore when it is fractured in the area of the bone — and it is fractured in the middle of the area — and is not known except by touch, the hour according to the shape of the fracture forces you to prepare it and reduce it according to the natural figure in every way that is possible for you to manage it
And finally, place a powder of wheat with egg white on the wound and a cushion; and place double powder over the wound; and place a sponge of table salt around the wound according to the quantity of the spatula or rather a little more.
May the sponge be surrounded by the concavity in some parts of the spatula, the hour will encase that concavity with a cushion, and finally place the sponge according to equality
And finally, strengthen the bandage with a wet bandage of long duration with a tight constriction and with a firm hold of the sponge until it is softened from the inside out
Consider the bandage every day; and when it is softened, lie another day and strengthen it and keep the sponge equal to the sponge if it is softened from the inside out

They already knew in those ancient times that it was caused by cold humors.
And so they say: cover with food the evil that brings about swelling and wind, because the belly should be swollen and extended, and the fracture should be impeded at the outer parts.</end_of_turn>
May we take care of this so that it does not become the cause of excessive bleeding; if not, it will happen in any case; and if it has already happened, then in this case it will be of help.</end_of_turn>
And I tell you that it is necessary to suspend from the wind and approach as if to a wound; and it is similar to reasoning, but indeed it is feared that the wind will draw out the humors from the area for the weakening.</end_of_turn
And I tell you that it is necessary to cover the area with a bandage that is already submerged in warm oil, and keep dust between the vertebrae until it is full, that the ligature be gentle when embracing that according to its roundness; and indeed take care of the evil with the care of nourishment and medicine.</end_of_turn>
And if it causes violent constriction of the patient who does not suffer from it, and if you prick him with a needle, remember about the patient, for indeed cover that the limb is fractured, uncover the broken edge, and indeed hold down that instrument which preserves the contents, remembering that which precedes it, and that it escapes from them, extracting that.</end_of_turn
And indeed adjust the two lips of the wound, if it is great, by boiling, and cure that with plaster until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if bleeding occurs, then cover with a cloth and pour powder in scented oil and place over the area, and that the evil be cured with that which covers the bleeding.</end_of_turn
And rest on the side on which you sleep, until it is healed.</end_of_turn>

Restoration of the fracture of the vertebra of the thigh and of the pelvis.</start_of_turn>
Some veins bleed after fracture of the bones of the pelvis, and it is necessary to cauterize them, and it is similar to the vertebrae of the thigh.</start_of_turn And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he is healed or not, consider that sometimes the wounds are already softened and stupefying and dead, and that you cannot make them swell or extend or straighten them without causing them to bleed again. If you tighten them with the belt or prick them with a needle and there is no pain in them, it is known that they are not healed.</start_of_turn
And if you make them swell with the belt and prick them with a needle, it is known that the bone is saved and the evil will go away with care.</start_of_turn
And if you see the vertebrae of the thigh like this and you want to know if he is healed or not, consider the feet.</start_of_turn
Indeed, sometimes they are already softened, it happens in the most serious cases, and indeed when it is lying on the thighs, it is windy and the urine is involuntary, and several veins are already resting on the thighs and cannot urinate, knowing that this is mortal, and do not work in the care of these.</start_of_turn
May there not be any other cause of these, for the cause is better and lighter.</start_of_turn
And the care of these is that you perforate with the cautery at the point of the fracture covered with warm oil, or with vinegar of eggs; and place over that anything that gives the veins rest.
And indeed remove one of the comfortable and existing plasters, and tighten over that which binds; and command the patient to rest and be tranquil and not to sleep on the side where he feels pain until he is healed.</start_of_turn
And if bleeding occurs from the fractured bone or any other cause that has already separated from it, then cover that the limb is fractured; and indeed adjust the two lips of the wound, with stitches if necessary; and indeed take care of that which is necessary for the recovery of the wound, until it is healed.</start_of_turn
Indeed if the thigh bone is fractured, and it is the end of the limb, then cover that you put your left hand on the buttock and that you embrace the fractured bone with the other hand as much as is possible for the equation according to the second rule; and indeed place over that plaster and bandage, if necessary, and tighten that.</start_of_turn
If you sit with your buttocks trending downwards, then lie over that way and keep that way, and care for the wound with the care that precedes until it is healed.
When you sit with your buttocks hanging downwards, then lie in that position and keep that position, and care for the wound with the care that precedes until it is healed.
Restoration of the limb.
The bones of the thighs are often fractured, and if they break, then the fracture of them is not other than a communication in the extremities of those and are inscribed in the length and decline towards the lower parts; and this causes pain in the area and puncture, and the limb is stupefaco when fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over that which is over the fracture which is the figure of it.
And if the fracture is only in the extremity of it, then you embrace that as much as you are able to until it is assembled to its natural figure.
May be if the fracture is in the thigh or that it already declines towards the lower parts, then you make the patient lie over the belly until it is prepared for you the restoration of that fracture And therefore when you have embraced that, place over it a compress, and place over that a bandage of wool or linen, and bind firmly about the which you fear no puncture of fracture or loosening of the bone.
And embrace the cavity with that which fills that which that prevents the stricture according to equality, and command the patient to lie on their side or rest on their side with the shoulder relaxed
May be if after this the cautery escapes, then you cease the extension of it and the restoration of it until the escape of the cautery has ceased, and place over that which is over that as much as is necessary until it is relaxed; and then return to the restoration of it, and bind firmly again as before
And if it happens in the buttocks or are comminuted, then you must treat them
End of document.
Restoration of the fracture of the adductor.
The adductor is that which is between the crease inside the hip and the head of the femur
And if it is fractured, then the restoration of it is in two ways, of which is that you grasp with your hand a fist of coarse sand according to this fashion:
And join in two extremities two ligaments, and then suspend it from the elevated place
And follow the patient on a seat; and then put the limb with the fractured bone outside over the fist until it reaches the navel of it in the middle of which the curvature of the thigh is attached
And then suspend over that any hard cause, or if the limb extends to the lower parts; and then the physician shall put what is necessary so that the fracture is as close to its place as possible until the fracture returns as it should.
And the other way is that the patient is supine on the cervical side and suspend the hand of the knee at the ligament; and command two attendants that one of them holds what is below the fracture with his hands; and the other holds the legs of it; and each of them extends to his part.
And if you wish that the extension should be stronger, then you bind firmly over the fracture with one ligament and over that with the other ligament, and each of the attendants extends both his parts
And therefore if the fracture is proximate to the extremity of the muscle, then cover that half of the ligament over the navel and the other over the fracture beyond the crease.
Similarly if the fracture is close to the crease, then cover that ligament over that place and over that crease
Embrace that with ease and rest, and when it is embraced as much as it should be according to that which is applied for good application, then bind firmly that which if no escape of cautery occurs
May be if after this the cautery escapes, then lay aside the stricture for seven days, and place over that a cloth soaked in vinegar and oil until the escape of the cautery has ceased, and then bind firmly again that which before
And the way to bind that is to place a compress over the fracture, and then place a bandage around the compress; and adjust the arm over that adductor, and place your hand open over the muscle.
And rest the limb and bind firmly over the adductor the arms so that the arm is in place of stiffness, if it does not impede anything of the fracture of the bone.
The hour has come.
And it is that you pause over the fracture that which is thicker and stronger than the others; and pause between every two bones the breadth of a finger, and the length of the bones according to the fracture plus three fingers from the base.
And then strengthen over the bones at the fracture which I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And that your grasp over the area of the fracture be very tight And when the fracture is long, the grasp should be less tight
And thus if sometimes the position of the bones and the grasp are as we have said at the beginning when you restore the limb to its proper position, then the hour has passed
And if you fear swelling from the cautery, then you leave the grasp and the bones inside for seven days as we have said
And then consider the ligament in all parts for three days so that it does not happen in the place of bruising or swelling; or it is prohibited to feed the limb to prevent surplus of grasp; and therefore rectify all that we have said.
Maybe if you are confident that no cause of this will happen, the hour will not remove the bandage until three days or more have passed.
And be your sleep from the patient on the side, and the attendants more on the chest.
And pause over the attendants who are cooking full of wool padding, and consider throughout the night or day that it is not swollen or dissolved the figure of the fractured limb, or that the ligament is softened, therefore rectify all that with your ability.
And pause feeding the patient according to the order that we have given more, except that the food is lukewarm at the beginning until it is grasped; and the hour orders that you remove the food from them.
For the custom of the attendants and the change of them is that they be strengthened for seven days; and the hour orders that they be removed and that bath be administered and that medicine be given, which will rectify that
And if the fracture is late, the hour does not order to remove the bandage from that limb for a day or two months.
Chapter XII.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two knuckles; of which one is small, and that which is at the little finger, and the other is great and that which is grasped from beyond the little finger, from the part beyond the little finger
And it is strong that only the greater knuckle is fractured, or the small, or that both are fractured together
And when the little knuckle is fractured, the hour of its restoration is light, and the healing is easier
And when the greater knuckle is fractured from beyond the little finger, the fracture is bad, and the healing is difficult
And the worse of all is when both bones are fractured together
Therefore if the bone that is fractured is the little one away from the body, the hour is convenient for the doctor to restore it, that is to say that he should pause little extension until that one is healed
And if the greater knuckle is that which is fractured, the hour orders that you pause extension more vehemently
And if both bones are fractured together, the hour orders that you avoid any violent movement
And you must pause the figure of the hand during the restoration of it and the extension of it supported on a cushion, and that the thumb be lower than the other fingers, and that the patient be centered on a cushion that has fallen down
And let there be a cushion under the limb at the height or below it, so that the patient does not suffer work.
And let another attendant extend the arm from the part beyond the elbow towards the shoulder or towards the ligament, and another attendant extend the other in the same way
And let the doctor join the bone until it is reduced according to the better figure that can be made
And if in the account of the bone there is swelling, the hour orders that you reduce all the limb in the place with your ability.
If on the other hand it appears in the patient that the swelling is separated and that the knee joint is not recovering as you had hoped, then withdraw from it and leave that according to the manner which we have taught you.
If the fracture is open, and I have already made an incision, then take care of that.
And if by chance the cautery should slip at the beginning of your restoration, then line up a piece of cotton soaked in oil and white wax, and put half between sponges and coarseness, and press firmly on that area until the swelling subsides; then keep the cotton there and place a prepared plaster over it made from powdered charcoal and powdered glass, and press firmly.
And know that the number of bones in the arm is seen in the greater precautions, or that the fracture is in one or two bones together
Then place your support firmly over the area of the fracture, and when more than enough has passed from the upper parts of the fracture to the lower parts of it, withdraw the support somewhat less strongly than before.
And the cloths which cover the fracture should be moist cloths, not dry or rough, and the thread which is used to tie it should be of a size neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have recommended.</start_of_turn>
Consider the limb and the ligament for a few days. And if any cause occurs which requires rectification, as for example in the limb, then do so immediately and cover the limb with cold water until the swelling subsides.</start_of_turn>
Keep the limb still until the pain subsides, and then remove the support.</start_of_turn>
And if the swelling has already subsided and the bone has already recovered and appears as before, then rectify everything with your skill.</start_of_turn>
And consider if the nourishment is prohibited from going to the limb because of excessive support, because in that case cover that little bit and leave that for a few days until it has recovered, and strengthen that.</start_of_turn
And if no other cause occurs which we have mentioned, do not remove the support for approximately xx days or so.</start_of_turn
And do not allow the patient to move their hand for their violent movement, and make them sleep on two pillows.</start_of_turn
And know that this fracture is restored in xxx days or in xxxii days, or for the most part in xxviii days, according to the condition of the complications and the ability of the art.</start_of_turn
Chapter XIII.</start_of_turn>
On the restoration of the fracture of the thumb and the fingers.</start_of_turn
Know that in the thumb and the fingers there is a fracture, and that it does not happen to them except by tearing soft tissue.</start_of_turn
And when the hand is fractured or the bone is fractured, then cover that the patient should continue to lie down and rest it gently as before, and place the hand over that which is extended.</start_of_turn
And then the minister extends the broken bones and the doctor unites them until they are congruent with good congruence.</start_of_turn
And cover that you stop the plaster and the cautery, if it does not happen to slip; and press the bandage according to the amount of the area, and you have already covered that with oil.
If the fracture is at the base of the thumb you must bend the palm of the hand, and make the patient keep it like that, and command the patient to strengthen that with the thumb fractured; strengthen it with oil long.</start_of_turn
And the splint which is on the wrist must be placed on the palm of the hand, so that the hand is applied to the palm; strengthen that as much as you cover.</start_of_turn
If the fracture is on the outside of the wrist, then cover that the splint is placed on the inside of the palm and another on the outside of the palm, so that the hand is open and closed; and press the support, as the hand is rotated between the fingers with the ligaments.</start_of_turn
And if there is a fracture in some of the bones of the fingers, if it is said to be displaced, then it must be united as much as you cover it and strengthen it with the palm of the hand, and if you want, support the small bones of the fingers so that the fracture is elevated and not crushed.</start_of_turn
May be if the fracture is in the other limb, just as in the middle toe, or in the index finger, or in the thumb, or in the ankle, or in the little toe, then it is equal and bound with the same name; or if they are all bound according to continuity, it is better; or stop over that little star, just as we have said before.
Consider, in your restoration, and indeed that, the arrangement of aftercare of cautery and oppose — alongside the present operation — against what happens when any cause of these is repeated, as it is repeated in the narration.
Chapter XIV.</start_of_turn>
Of the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.</start_of_turn
The thigh bone which has been violently fractured is split and is declared as feeling according as it is converted to the surrounding parts and the surrounding pus.</start_of_turn
And the restoration of it is done in such a way that the ligament is strained over the fracture and another ligament leaves the fracture, and the patient is placed prone on the abdomen and on the face.</start_of_turn
And indeed the minister extends all the ligament to its quality when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.</start_of_turn
May be if it is close to the hip, however, the ligament is rather directed to the nail at the part of the fifth, so that the extension rests upon it, and the other ligament leaves the fracture.</start_of_turn
And in the same way if the fracture is close to the nail, however, the ligament is rather directed to the nail, and the extension is towards the parts left.</start_of_turn
And indeed the doctor should bite the bone both above and below until the fracture is reduced according to the natural conformation and the bone is joined by a good connection; the hour covers that rest plaster and stricture, if it does not happen to the limb aftercare.</start_of_turn May be if it happens in the aftercare, however, the hour allows that to pass for a few days until the cautery aftercare is softened, and indeed return to your care.</start_of_turn
The stricture is indeed sufficient: cover that you cover with a hard bandage over the fracture, and bend that two or three times, and remove its excess; and indeed cover the limb until it reaches the hip and the hip itself.</start_of_turn
And indeed keep long thread firmly between the hip and the limb next to the nail at the parts left, and bring the extremities of the thread to the part of the pus surrounding the two parts, and indeed roll over the limb and the hip over that which exceeds the bandage.</start_of_turn
And indeed rest over the hip at the place of that fracture star, and rest from those a little star over the bone of the limb.</start_of_turn
And indeed fill the spaces between the limb and the thigh with soft cloths, so that the stricture is solidified.</start_of_turn
And indeed begin with a strong stricture from the middle over the place of the fracture with three bands or four, and when you have advanced to the ligament of the place of the fracture, your stricture is less and lighter and softer.</start_of_turn
And indeed extend two extremities of the thread to the parts left until it reaches the ankle, and strain both extremities of the nails of the other side so that the ligament is not pulled from the place.</start_of_turn
And indeed rest the stricture over that, so that neither the limb is deformed nor the cautery aftercare nor swelling occurs and that it remains like that; and if any cause of these should happen, then immediately take away that which causes it, and rectify what has happened as soon as possible, as we have said above.</start_of_turn
May be if in the bone is bad of the bone which put, however, the hour covers that you bite that according to what is possible; and if not, leave it out and remove that, and care for what precedes the memory until it is healed.</start_of_turn
And indeed every bandage is strained for this fracture of the thigh bone another way that they are adjusted to the nails, as we have said in the instruments and in the arms.</start_of_turn
May be indeed in the restoration of it in such a way that it does not happen to the patient's lameness; and if it is restored alone, another way that the other limb is applied, the hour is necessary that the one which is lame be lame.</start_of_turn
And indeed know that the thigh bone is strained for forty days or a little more or a little less, according to the diversity of the complexities and of the other resources.</start_of_turn
Capitol XV.
Capital XV.
You know that the fracture of the ankle bone often happens with great violence towards the soft parts around it.
If there is violence towards the fracture, the only thing that is seen is a fissure or break in its parts, and that is neither pain nor swelling, and over that all is sensation
And the restoration of it is that it is greased that which is broken in the parts of it until it is united and joined as much as possible for equality and facility and making.
And put on a bandage and keep your hand over that round star, if you order that; and strengthen it as much as is convenient.
And consider all the precautions that we have recommended in other fractures, just as for example the ointment of cautery and the similar ones that are opposed to all accidents that may happen to it until it is healed
Capital XVI.
From the restoration of the fracture of the femur
You know that in the femur there are two bones of which one is thick, and it is called the femur; and the other is thin, and it is called the fibula
And the violence of any kind of fracture that happens to both bones of the leg is such that for its restoration it is as much necessary as the restoration of the arm, and the operation of it is one
And if both bones are fractured together, the femur is converted to all its parts
And if the thin bone is fractured, the femur is converted to the parts surrounding it
And if the thick bone is fractured, you must leave it like that, and that is from these causes that you are not aware of
And give it extension and equality and support of the limbs according to the healing.
However, if the fracture of the femur is slight without great swelling, that the extension should be more gentle and lighter, and relieve you from your virtue.
And in the femur there is any cause of operation over the arm, and that is when your bones are aligned and when you have completed all your work of the operation, then you will take hold of the heel of the foot which is held away from the causes that are held back alone, and it is enough to grasp those which are small in greatness, and do not touch the hands, and let the length of these be according to the length of the femur and the ankle until to the heel.
And cover over any wound with two coverings according to their length, and keep one over the part of the femur from one side and the other from the other side, and they should reach from the ankle until to the heel of the foot
And tie the two bones in three places at the two extremities and at the middle, so that the structure of the femur is prohibited from leaning to the right and left, and stays in a good position.
And a plaster cast has been administered according to the length of the femur; and keep it fixed in it the femur so that it conserves that movement.
And most importantly keep that you do not feel any pain in the fracture, and when that is properly healed
And consider in every day the femur and study it in that way, and you will keep it from posturing and from swelling or from other causes similar to these; and when any cause of these happens, the hour you will take it from it until it is healed
Capital XVII
From the fracture of the ankle and the bones of the foot and the toes
The ankle does not often fracture; however, the bones of the foot do sometimes fracture; and as for the toes, they rarely fracture, and they do not fracture except in cases of great violence.
And if the bones of the foot must fracture sometimes, and these bones must sometimes be elevated between them, then put the patient's foot on the prepared earth as if you were going out
And keep the foot on that which is elevated from those bones, and put on shoes, and hold and heal those until they are back in their places.
And immediately stop the bleeding and hold, and stop the juice from the foot a little table on which are two plugs of plaster.
And immediately stretch that which is on the foot and straighten it down, because you have covered that with gauze and other things of which you must inquire.</end_of_turn>
And when three or four days have passed, then you will remove the ligament, because you will find the bones united or fractured or dislocated, and the operation in these cases is quite painful.</end_of_turn>
But if anyone says they are fractured, then restore those and bind those thus as I have said and command you to do in the restoration of the hand bones.</end_of_turn And immediately stop the bleeding from the fractured bone according to the length of the bone; and put a little more pressure on it; and then place the foot on the little table that I have recommended, and stretch that which is straightened down.</end_of_turn>
But if the bones that are fractured are two or three or more, then you immediately stop the bleeding from each bone that is enveloped in soft leather, and stretch the table under the foot and stand over one of the heads of the table under the foot so that it has good retention.</end_of_turn>
And it is convenient for you to know that you must not neglect all the causes which we have mentioned to you in other fractures of accidents that we have mentioned; and pay attention to all that we have said about this.</end_of_turn>
Chapter XVIII.</end_of_turn>
Of the fracture of the bone of the thigh and of the bone of the heel and of the ankle bone.</end_of_turn
When the bone of the thigh is fractured, then immediately cease in the painful swelling, and incline that towards the part of the two a little, and keep it stretched out behind.</end_of_turn
And immediately fill the wound with cotton wool, and keep the bone of the foot firmly in place as expected; and elevate the two little toes a little, so that all that is outside is forgotten until the part of the bone is back in place as expected and the fractured bone returns.</end_of_turn
And immediately stop powders on the two sides, and when you want to urinate, moisten the cotton wool easily and immediately, and reduce and return that according to the manner in which it was at the beginning, and immediately return the powder from before.</end_of_turn
And do thus for seven days or until it is restored.</end_of_turn
And if you wish, take once a vessel of oil and stretch over the ankle a catheter of glass; and pour all the vessel into the foot, and immediately apply pressure in the catheter until the vessel is filled up until the fracture returns.</end>
And immediately fill the wound with cotton wool and keep it for several days as we have recommended, until it is healed.</end_of_turn>
And when the bone of the heel or of the thigh is fractured, then immediately administer in the restoration and agility of them what we have recommended in the ankle bone.</end_of_turn
And what is fractured is not hidden in these primary fractures and that little pain, mostly for one who has studied and practiced this book; for that fracture means for you in the greatest possibilities of restoration and in the strengthening of them, and therefore understand well.</end_of_turn
But in the ankle bone when it is fractured, take unguents of ivy, and put the ankle in that; and immediately stop over the covering of cotton wool, and keep it covered, and keep it like that for three days or until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XIX.</end_of_turn
Of the restoration of the fracture of the bones when it is inflamed.</end_of_turn
It is convenient in that in which the fracture has occurred with swelling, and especially if the bone is large as that of the thigh or the heel, or similar to that, that you take care of them and apply poultices to them as much as possible, even if the symptoms of inflammation testify to the contrary as we have said.</end_of_turn
And if the swelling subsides, then immediately cover that you keep at the retention of them what you have powdered over them before, if for another reason it is not present.</end_of_turn
And immediately begin to restore the fracture in that same day, and do not prolong that, if not the after-pain appears.</end_of_turn
May be if an accident happens after the cautery, then you must leave the restoration of the limb until the swelling has subsided, until the swelling has gone down, and do not approach it on the third day and the fourth in total, for you will cause further accidents.
May be if the bone is fractured, it is imminent on the surface of the wound, then you must know that you must perforate in order to reduce and heal that with little extension.
May be if the extension is not as you have prepared and the equilibrium of the limb is in your thighs, then you must reduce that with your hands; and that is a wound that is made by the iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers and the width according to the quantity of the wound; and for that reason the doctor must anticipate those three or four according to the quantity that you indicate in the cure of every kind of fracture
And be round, and be in it little roughly so that it is not doubled from the pressure during the operation.
And be from the acute limb to which it is bound in the joints of the limbs; and be attentive to the decrease of it to the greatest extent, and from the middle to the parts
And this is the way of it:
And it is called in Greek “labre volentz atelarem”, so it is little pale
For that you must suspend the acute limb elevated over the limb of the prominent bone
And insert it into a groove until the bone returns, and be healed with any equilibrium
And therefore strive to heal the limbs of the fracture between them, and if the fractured limb is thin, and you do not take that wound into account, then you must insert the limb of that bone until the instrument has power over it
May be if you cannot reduce the bone completely as we have recommended, then you must cut away that which covers it from the dissectors whom we have mentioned; or saw that with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you
And then scrape away that which remains in the bone of asperity and small sores
And when the bone is reduced, and the pain of the patient is calmed, then you must know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to comfort the patient greatly.
When your restoration of the limb is complete, which you have done to the bone, then you must immerse the limb in black vinegar, and indeed if it is in summer, and do not leave it on the wound or any other cause in which there is oil, for that will cause it to become inflamed and corrupt
And indeed administer sponges at the time of eating as a supplement to the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered until you have inserted the tube with forceps and used bandages according to the quantity of the wound
And take care that you do not tighten the wound in the fracture, for many doctors have seen that this causes greater pain to the patients, and that it causes wounds to become infected or gangrenous, so it is better to leave it alone. And if the limb strictures too much, soft, different from the stricture of other fractures
And if the wound is great or is bad, and you fear about those other accidents that we have recommended, and if you find pain in the place, then do not leave it on that bandage, but rather make that bandage of fine cloth in place of sponges and strengthen it with those things
And when a couple of days have passed since the wound has begun, that there should be generated heat, then you must remove the sponge which you had placed on it with that vinegar, and then administer calamine, knowing that this is what we usually do to remedy wounds, just as we do with calamine tetrafarmacon and following that same method
And remind you that you must remove the dressing and consider the wound every morning and evening until it is consolidated and stopped, and that the limb is prepared in such a way that the pain will disappear from it to the parts beyond with ease.
If the wound has been going on for a few days, and it is not consolidated or is not separated from the limb by the heat, then you must know that there is a delay in the healing of the little things so that you must keep the wound covered with tension. And from those delays those that remain are extracted, those that have not been extracted cause pain to the limb and make it painful, pierce to insert them as you can
If swelling or redness occurs on the palm of the hand or the sole of the foot, it is usually a sign of festering, or some other kind of corruption and putrefaction, for which the narrative preceding this one in the preceding chapter provides a cure.
When the swelling is great, it is necessary to leave the limb as it is, along with the attendants and the stretcher, and do not presume to extract it, for this would cause death; let it rest until it softens naturally, which will take approximately twenty days or more.</end_of_turn> And thus the swelling will be cured if you leave it alone, and if you do not leave it alone.</end_turn>
Chapter twenty.</end_turn>
Concerning the treatment of swelling that occurs in the aftermath of any fracture.</end_turn>
These swelling arises from the putrefaction of the bone in the aftermath of healing from a fracture, and is especially harmful to the joints, and is often the cause of their stiffness; and it is necessary to prevent the limb from its natural movement.</end_turn
Therefore, if the swelling is recent, administer such medicines as have been shown to be efficacious in other cases, and let it be known that I saw, and heard, and smelled, and observed that these methods were successful in other cases; take some of these medications or all of them, and apply them to the swelling with oil, or vinegar, or alum, and keep it covered with a bandage, and bind it tightly.</end_turn
And let the extraction be delayed for a few days; and when it is done, repeat it until the swelling has subsided; or strengthen the lamina of lead downwards, for lead has the property of healing all that is swollen in the limbs.</end_turn
Even if the swelling is already solidified and hardened, and necessity compels you to extract it, do so cautiously, and only remove the soft parts, leaving the solid parts untouched; and close the wound and care for it until it has healed.</end_turn
Chapter twenty-one.</end_turn
Concerning the restoration of a fractured bone when it has healed and when the limb is left stiff and painful contrary to its natural tendency.</end_turn
When a bone fracture has healed, and when the limb is left stiff and painful, the following are not useful: multiple treatments for ligament and tendon laxity that has become excessive; excessive rigidity of the ligaments, which hinders the proper nourishment of the limb; excessive inflammation; abnormal movements at an inappropriate time; and general weakness of the patient and debility.</end_turn
The treatment for this is to feed the patient and make them comfortable until their strength returns; give them baths; and, if necessary, provide medical care and instruct them.</end_turn
And keep the limb still to prevent the accumulation of pus, which would impede the circulation of nourishment, or continue to bandage the limb with warm water, until the nourishment returns to its natural state.</end_turn
Chapter twenty-two.</end_turn
Concerning the treatment of fractured bones when they have been restored without any twisting, and the prevention of their further operation by any means whatsoever.</end_turn
When a fractured limb has already undergone restoration, it is necessary to prevent further twisting and swelling of the fractured bone and the surrounding area; however, it is not necessary to prevent the limb from performing its natural movements, as long as you do not cause further damage to the limb itself.</end_turn
Indeed, many foolish doctors and restorers have caused great harm in this matter; and this operation is dangerous, causing great fear of death.</end_turn
If the swelling and redness are recent, it is necessary to cover them with warm water in which there are many herbs that have a soothing effect, such as chamomile and rue, meadowsweet, and ivy; or apply plaster of Paris with a soft dressing or with gypsum or oil of thyme; or take figs and barley and chamomile, or consume poppy seeds and bruise them with cocks feathers, and resemble those medicines that are not harmful to consolidation.</end_turn
And many physicians dissolve it with constant rubbing that is too rough, and with the administration of movements to the limb at all hours.</end_turn
If the swelling has already gone down and has become firm and converted, and if it is necessary to treat it with force, the pus must be drained and the continuation of the bone must be dissolved, and the cause of the swelling must be treated, which is a subtle inflammation of the surrounding tissues, and this must be remedied by applying a solution that is appropriate for the condition.</end_turn
Capitol .xxiii.
When there is displacement of the limb.
A displacement of any limb joint, which is prohibited from movement, and which causes pain and great lesions.
Therefore, when an dislocation occurs, it is necessary to perforate (make an incision) in order to reduce it, and do it without delay, for if it is delayed, the limb is swollen and the dislocation is more difficult to reduce
And do not keep your hand too tight during the reduction, because it can cause spasm and pain
When this has happened, then you must lie down the patient, and put the limb into water which is lukewarm and oily, and reduce it with ease.
And all the limb must be treated with the water from which the memory remains in its limb.
And thus we have completed the capitols of dislocation in the order in which they are preceded by fracture; from the upper part of the body downwards
End of document.
Treatment for dislocation of the jaw bone.
The two mandibles are displaced if they are not taut; and the dislocation of both is common in two ways: that they are rigidly fixed in their places for little displacement, or that they are completely displaced and complicated, until they are softened at the junction where saliva flows from the patient’s mouth and they cannot open their mouth or swallow, and their tongue is swollen in their throat
If the dislocation is slight, it returns by itself without any cause
If the dislocation is complete and complicated, it is necessary to perform a reduction immediately.
The minister should hold the patient’s head, and the doctor should insert his thumb of the affected limb into the crease of the dislocation of the mandible outwards from the mouth, if the dislocation is of one part; or he should insert his two thumbs together if the dislocation is of two parts, and the other hands tell him which of the limbs must be moved; and the patient should stop moving his jaws and should not move from any part; and the doctor should grasp the mandible and reinsert it into its place
If the reduction is difficult, and above all if both jaws are simultaneously displaced, the physician should administer evaporation with lukewarm water and oil, until it is sufficient to facilitate the reduction of both without delaying the reduction of both too much, as we have said.
When they have returned and are softened, close the patient’s mouth and do not soften it; pause over those particles of matter in the corners, and apply wax and oil; and hold firmly with ease
Let the patient lie down on his two thighs, and support his head between two pillows, so that he does not move either to the right or the left; do not force him to swallow; have him keep his tongue still, until when the pain has subsided and the jaws are not displaced, you can order him to open his mouth again
And this should be administered with ease, and do not work on the opening of the patient’s mouth except for eating and drinking and spitting, until the mandible is healed and restored
If it is difficult to reduce two jaws when they are displaced at any time and are not converted to their proper places, the physician must take measures which cause fever and excessive sweating, and is likely to alert the patient’s belly, and is likely to cause vomiting of pure bile.
And in such a case, the physician should know that it is a loss; and that he should not attempt to do what is lost in a few days.

Treatment for dislocation of the sternum and the extremity of the muscle
The sternum is not displaced from the latus because of its continuity with the toes; and some are displaced to the outside, and this is declared by the feeling.
The restoration is that the patient grasps his two thighs and extends his arms. And hold the limb with your palm with great pressure, so that it returns to its place
And now stop over that ointment and powder and strengthen that.
May the extremity of that which is causing the pain remain fixed and continue in that place; let it not be dislocated at any time; for it is necessary that it be reduced and made even as we have said before and as is fitting for your appearance.</end_of_turn>
And now stop over that ointment, powder, and traction, and command the patient to remain calm and quiet until they are healed.</end_of_turn>
And in this manner the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its socket.</end_of_turn>
(The text ends here)</start_of_turn>
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.</start_of_turn>
It is known that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated from the part of the tibia to the part beyond.</start_of_turn
And the second is that it is dislocated from the part below the muscle, and that is sufficient; it is not dislocated at the back by the scapula; and it is not dislocated at the front by the nerves.</start_of_turn
And most frequently it is dislocated outwards beyond the tibia, and more so in those in whom the flesh is scanty, while it is dislocated with difficulty in those in whom there is much flesh; for in these latter it is more difficult to reduce it.</start_of_turn
And it is often seen in these cases that a man has struck his limb with a blow or by chance, and the muscle of it is protruded from its socket, and is reduced by that which has already been said to be necessary.</start_of_turn
Therefore you must stay until you are certain that it is well reduced, and then proceed with the treatment of it.</start_of_turn
And it is known that the dislocation of the muscle is when it is beyond the tibia; so that you must distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the sound muscle, for you will find among these various appearances; and you will find at the head of the muscle a concavity facing towards the tibia as if there were a ball, and the patient is not able to reduce their hand to the socket or to move it in any way.</start_of_turn
If it is dislocated from the foot or from below, and you find it manifested on the touch, and it is not hidden.
And for this dislocation it is sufficient to make a gentle reduction when the patient is fresh and the physician is young.</start_of_turn
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises the limb above the knee; and immediately place the toes behind the tibia of the limb and elevate the joint to its socket with strength, and the minister raises the limb and extends it outwards; and immediately pause that so that it returns naturally.</start_of_turn
And if it does not return as we have said, and if it has been from the beginning that the dislocation occurred, for several days, the patient must be bathed in warm water and be administered embrocation which softens and lubricates as if it were composed of salt of high degree, and rue, and melilot in water, and be administered.</start_of_turn
And immediately the patient should be placed lying down on the bed and be kept still from the knee downwards until the limb is equal between elevation and tension, and the physician should place their hand over the heel of the limb and raise the head of the muscle with force, and pull the patient's hand so that it is not bruised at the lower parts, and another minister should hold the head of the limb, so that it is not bruised at the lower parts, for both these things must return to the socket.</start_of_turn
And if you wish, reduce it in this manner: and that you make yourself to be present a man who is longer than the patient, and that he stands on that side, and interpose the knee of the muscle between the tibia of the patient and elevate the tibia to the parts above until the patient is suspended in air, and another minister pulls the patient's hand away from the lower parts of the thigh.</start_of_turn And if the patient is flexible, it is necessary that another cause be suspended, for so will this be more likely that the dislocation will return.</start_of_turn
And it is reduced easily in another manner: and that a long staff be placed on the ground whose head is rounded like a mortar pestle, which is neither thick nor thin, and that it be placed under the patient; for when it is placed over the head of the staff the patient is standing according to the length of the staff, and the hand is extended outwards from the other side; and the body of the limb is extended from the other side with force, so that the joint returns to the socket quickly.</start_of_turn
If reduction proves difficult for all the reasons mentioned, then use this remedy: take a fistful of the quantity that is as long as two barleycorns and as wide as four fingers, and let its bulk be relaxed in the palm of the hand following this fashion:
If reduction proves difficult for all the reasons mentioned, then use this remedy: take a fistful of the quantity that is as long as two barleycorns and as wide as four fingers, and let its bulk be relaxed in the palm of the hand following this fashion: place the thumb and four fingers over the rounded top of the fist so that the fist does not damage the patient.</end_of_turn>
If reduction proves difficult for all the reasons mentioned, then use this remedy: take a fistful of the quantity that is as long as two barleycorns and as wide as four fingers, and let its bulk be relaxed in the palm of the hand following this fashion: place the thumb and four fingers over the rounded top of the fist so that the fist does not damage the patient. Keep the patient's chest still and extend your hand or arm over the fist within the patient's parts, and bind the fist over the adjutorium and arms and the extremity of the hand.</end_of_turn>
If reduction proves difficult for all the reasons mentioned, then use this remedy: take a fistful of the quantity that is as long as two barleycorns and as wide as four fingers, and let its bulk be relaxed in the palm of the hand following this fashion: place the thumb and four fingers over the rounded top of the fist so that the fist does not damage the patient. Keep the patient's chest still and extend your hand or arm over the fist within the patient's parts, and suspend the other limb from the other side, so that the joint is relaxed throughout.</end_of_turn>
And when the intestine or hernia has been completed according to any possible way, then stop. Keep your hand still over the chest and prepare a plaster with powdered alum and herbs over all the muscles, even if it is rotated downwards, and then tighten the intestines with a tight binding; the ligament should be rotated over the plaster, and the hand should be fixed to the patient's collarbone, and be left for a while. Do not move the patient's hand for seven days.</end_of_turn
And keep the patient's diet light until the limb is comforted, for it is more conducive to recovery.</end_of_turn>
And keep the diet given somewhat more than usual for seven or eight days; or exercise some movement. Therefore if it is kept still and not relieved, it is already healed.</end_of_turn>
More so if the joint is dislocated somewhat by moisture that happens to it or by some other cause, then it is necessary to administer cautery three times, as it is said above.</end_of_turn
And if all this has been done and seven days have passed since the treatment was begun, if the ligament has not been healed and the joint is not stopped, and if the plaster and the tightening are reduced over it every day, and if it is not stopped and cast and cannot raise the limb above its parts, it is known that the nerves of the limb, which are at the head of the muscle, are already insensitive or extended or softened, and you know that the joint will never be fixed in place forever.</end_of_turn
As for the dislocation of the foot or ankle or the heel or the lower parts, the reduction is successful with a sudden impulse and extension of the limb, until it returns.</end_of_turn
And let the other tightening be administered in this way, and take care of it until it is healed.</end_of_turn
And if by chance the natural healing of the limb is delayed due to gravity in the limb and its tardiness in movement, then the physician should use hot packs until that gravity is relieved and the limb returns to its original state.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXVII.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of ankle dislocation.</end_turn
You know that the ankle joint is dislocated with difficulty and almost returns with difficulty; and that which is dislocated in all parts, and more so in the part towards the heel, and the dislocation of the limb is not hidden from you because it is evident either because it is left unattended or because it is grasped according to whatever figure it is dislocated, and when the ankle joint is adjusted and the dislocation is released from the limb, that is to say when it is declared to you, that the joint is flattened and cannot bend the limb, or touch anything of that sort.</end_turn
And that you must hold the ankle still, and reduce the dislocation as much as possible before the callous comes back, for if you see the callous come back, the reduction will be difficult, and will not be successful of anything; and more so if it is towards the heel, for it is worse of all other kinds of dislocation, and of greater pain, and many veins are torn in that area which must be held still in order to die.</end_turn
And the restoration of the limb, when that which is possible is to extend the hand of the limb downwards twice as much, expand the arms of the limb, and place the hands of the physician over the ankle and under the limb, and the plaster the joint with the nails of the thumb and the four fingers of the hand, or with the edge of the palm towards the joint until it returns to its place.</end_turn
May it be that if dislocation is towards the front, then return it in such a way that you bend your hand with your other hand, until you pierce the fold with the edge of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to the reduction, then administer violent extension and strong traction.
And two assistants extend the arms, and hold the patient's limbs so that they do not suffer from the traction
Then revolve the limbs throughout their extent, since it is enveloped in skin doubled along the hand or ligament.
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, anoint that with some oil so that these causes may be eliminated which help to lubricate the joint and facilitate; and then push the joint forcefully until it returns
Then make the reduction firm so that it is fixed over the embolus in which there is stypticity and exudate with an album of blood, and extend it with stricture descending, and suspend the arm from the collar, and leave it for several days.
Then remove the dressing; and therefore if the joint is formed in the flesh, the doctor tears the ligament of the limb and leaves that alone
And if the joint is not healed, the doctor repeats the packing and the ligament, and leaves that for several days until it is extruded; and then remove that.</start_of_turn>
May it be that if these things happen to it during the reduction of the joint, and the situation is in movement, then administer moisture in oil and coarse friction, and support, until it is relieved; or rest upon the joint without any fatty substance; and then bind it, and leave that on the limb and night.</start_of_turn> And do the same with that, and put it in oil; and when it swells, the doctor should cool the joint with temperate friction, and then repeat over that relieved, so is rhythmic movement, once, twice, and thrice.</start_of_turn The corruption has already arrived at the innermost parts of the bath, within that it is limited.</end_of_turn>
And if you wish, rest upon that wound of the moist cow and cover it with lint around the border and stretch over that; and make some compresses, which are moist and reduce it to its situation.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXVIII.</start_of_turn>
Of the care of dislocation of a limb, that is between the arm and the hand.</start_of_turn
A limb that is excessively painful is dislocated, and the reduction of the dislocation of the limb is light, unlike other joints, however it is necessary to have speed in the reduction of the limb at the time when it is dislocated, because the limb is apostematized or that something has happened to it during the apostematization.
And the reduction of the dislocation of the limb is that you place the thumb of the patient on a table and the doctor extends the limb, and the doctor places his hand or palm over the imminent part of the joint, and pushes that until it returns to its proper place.</start_of_turn
However it must be considered if the palm is already bent inward of the hand, the doctor must place two fingers of the patient on a table beside the extension and the reduction; and if the dislocation is previous, the doctor must place two fingers of the hand on the table, so that the hand of the doctor covers that imminent part of the joint.</start_of_turn
And so if it returns well, that is good; and if not, the doctor must strengthen that with packing yielding the apostematization and leave that alone; do not repeat that, for if you do, you will suffer or will not succeed in the reduction of the limb except that many days have passed.</start_of_turn
However the joint remains according to its stiffness; and do not note to the patient any cause, but that the hand is softened and cannot be strengthened against any cause; the doctor must know that the nerves are torn or crushed, and that it is not strained in it except that it is strengthened with a pointed cautery and is firm as much as the cause confers.
Therefore when the limb is returned, the doctor pauses over it the packing that has been recommended, and it is left and strengthened for five days; and then it is removed and left, and the hand is exercised.</start_of_turn
However if its movement is delayed and something happens to it in any gravity, the doctor should cool that with cold water and with some compresses, until it is relieved.</start_of_turn
Chapter XXIX.</start_of_turn
From the care of dislocation of the fingers.
Some veins are dislocated throughout the fingers.
And when any finger of those two at the palm or at the belly of them is dislocated, then it is said to be stiff and it urges the dislocation back to its place until it returns
And then support the head of the finger, and suspend that part to which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
And then suspend that and extend that until it is equal in that same day
And when night comes, bind that according to that narration, and do not stop loosening that in the day and exercising with movement, and bind that at night; do this for several days until it is healed
Do the same with what was said before, if it is dislocated at the belly of the hand, and bind that part to that place and do what was said before regarding the first operation, until it is healed
Similarly do the same when it is dislocated in other parts.

From the care of dislocation of the vertebrae of the spine.
When it happens that any vertebra of the spine or the pelvis dislocates completely, and some vertebrae remain loose from their places, in such a case there is no cure, for death is hidden under the disease
And a sign of that is that the evacuation of the disease is outside the will, and it cannot be retained; and some veins are softened in some part of the body or two veins of the body or two bones of the body, or one of those; or a vertebra is loosened from its place, which is neither softened nor is it strengthened, and it is useful to remove those to four parts
Therefore that which is loosened at the back is called gelliosis
The care of these is that you consider if the gelliosis happened in infancy, for in that case neither the cure nor the healing of all is possible
More than that, if it be seen by observation or percussion or by feeling that those who knew the Ancient methods of treatment say that they are prolonged, from which indeed the most useful returns; but I have already known that there is a brief one of those that is more useful than the long one, because of my proximity to the understanding of my exposure, to which I have been accustomed and have learned from various instruments of that which I will show you and explain that one.
And that one is cured only when it happens in the two bones themselves as I recommend
And that the disease be extended over its face over the jaw so that it fills all the surrounding parts so that it does not touch the bones of the foot
And then support the limb so that it is fixed in the earth at the foot of the limb, and another support in the opposite foot in the other foot
And the minister has the limb, and do not let it be fixed in a fossa; and another minister has the other in that manner.
And then cover over the head of the disease and leave the thumbs free; and extend the limb to the limb which is beside the thumb, and bind that to it; and then strengthen the other ligament over the ankles of the foot and its bones; and adjust all the ligaments and bind those to the other limb.
And then the minister grasp the limb and extends the ligament to the part of the limb, and do not let the two limbs and the ligaments of the joints in which they are fixed remain loose, but indeed do not fix them as we have said
And the doctor places his palms on the vertebra with strength until it returns, or that he places them on a table, and that he adjust on the table the soles of the feet until they return
But if it does not return in this way, the doctor takes a table of which the width or the length is in the air of three bones, and he digs in the wall of which we have said that it is proper for the disease to be placed a place where the limb of the table intersects And then he places the palm of the table on the vertebra, and the doctor places the soles of the feet on the other limb, and he pulls until the vertebra is fractured and returns to its place.
If you wish, open the turn which is rotated in the hand; and stay on the ground, place the head of the patient behind the two thighs, the length of which is equal to an arm, and place the head of the patient behind the two knees; and let the length be between each two fingers, and already it is made in every finger that turns, and every one that is fixed on the ground so that it does not become nauseous.
And let one finger be round in which the turn is made, and let it be rotated in the two joints of the two fingers.
And at the end of these is a joint in which the finger is formed, the length of which is equal to a palm as much as it is rotated; and in the two other fingers it is similar to that.
And then strengthen the ligaments that you have stretched in the patient's feet in the area where you placed the head of the foot, and the ligaments that you have stretched in the area of the patient's toes in the turn where you placed the feet
And then you must make every turn and keep a minister who will support the turn with his hand, and the doctor will stabilize the spine according to what we have said.
And when the spine is returned and the limb is healed, then you must wait a while before you move, and then stop; and place your hand over the bandage of the thumb, which should be as wide as three fingers or more, and as long as it reaches the joint of the knee, and over the part of the spine that is below the joint of the knee to the heel
And then bind it with the ligament that we have mentioned, and use the patient for a nourishing diet until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the limb at the end of the healing, then you must administer medicines that soften and soothe with the administration of alum for a long time, which we have recommended; and it is administered in that soft paste of lead
And every time that violent swelling arises behind the vertebrae of the two thighs, it is cured by that dislocation; and that is the bone which has already mentioned that it must not be allowed to become fayta in this way because of this medicine, which makes the limb swell excessively.
Chapter 21.
On the care of a dislocated ankle.
You must know that the ankle joint and the ankle muscle joint do not move only by dislocation, but also by other affections that affect the small bones that cause swelling and concavity
The ankle joint is dislocated in four ways, which is at the front, at the back, at the top, or at the bottom
Mostly it is dislocated at the front, and slightly at the top or at the bottom
A sign of the dislocation of the ankle is that when you adjust the limb of the healthy ankle with the limb of the patient, the heel is longer and more prominent than the heel of the healthy limb, the ankle cannot bend its knee towards the ground, and the limb can be bent only with difficulty after the cautery is removed because the head of the bone has already passed over here.
The sign of the dislocation at the top is that these bones suffer the opposite of this accident
The sign of the dislocation at the bottom is that the limb expands its circumference according to custom, but it does not bend in the painful area; and if it is forced to bend, it cannot do so without great pain; and the urine is retained and the swelling is great, and you must walk the limb on the ankle bone
The sign of the dislocation at the back is that it does not expand the heel, nor does it permit bending of the ankle that is bending the swelling, and the limb is shorter than the other, and the swelling is softened, and the head of the bone is over that place
More reduction of these species of dislocation is that you consider, when, if the dislocation is old and ancient, that it is already outdated with the one you have just administered, so do not repeat it; for in this cure there is no need for it.
More in the one where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four species of dislocation, then you must keep the joint immobile and extend it towards the front and the back, and rather towards the right and left, for the force will return and will not suffer from any other cure
May be, if he does not return in this manner, that you prepare a strong minister and extend the limb from this side beyond, or from the other side, or ligate that which is liated upon the limb from beneath; and another minister extend the hand of him whom you put on the side of the thigh, so that his thumb rests on the side of the limb; and then tighten the ligature over the root of the limb and hold another minister over the extremity of the ligature.
And be extension of the limb or from the groin to the angle of the hip, or from the back to the side of the thigh.
And let the extension of all these be in a straight line until the patient is elevated upon a cushion of earth and remains hanging down
And this kind of extension is common to all four limbs
And therefore if the dislocation returns as we have said, it is well; and if not, it is necessary to take all the means that we said concerning the care of the limb.
In the reduction of the limb itself, when it is dislocated, if the dislocation is at the groin, cover that the patient be placed supine upon the outer thighs; and immediately suspend the ligaments over the root of the limb in that place where between the head of the thigh and the place that is left to hang down; and then extend the limb from the side of the thigh to the highest part of the hip
And immediately another minister grasps the knees of the limb, and immediately hold the great toe of the painful limb and extend to the other side for violent extension, so that that which returns to the hip socket.
And this is the milder cure for which this limb is reduced than the others
Or if it is excused by you and you do not obey the order concerning this method of cure, it is necessary that both feet of the patient be bound together with a strong ligature, with care, above both ankles and above both toes.
And let the length of each be equal to the quantity of four fingers, and let the painful limb be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers
And immediately suspend the limb above the head of the thigh and that it is in the middle; and let the length of the limb from the earth be the quantity of two thighs.
And immediately command a strong youth to reduce the head of the thigh, and that another youth suspend the limb, and the other youth grasp the thigh with strength, so that the joint returns to the hip socket quickly
And in the reduction itself, when it is dislocated at the hip, cover that the patient grasp about the knee according to what we have recommended in the previous paragraph; and tighten the ligament over the painful limb itself and over the toes of the limb
And immediately two cushions are placed, one under the foot of the limb, and the other under the head; and immediately adjusted cushions are placed under the middle of the thigh resting upon which a damp cloth is wrapped, so that the limb is not dampened because the thigh is between the thighs of the patient, so that the extension to the lower parts is not too violent
And immediately every minister extends his part, and the doctor with his hand grasps the reduction according to the art
And when the dislocation is at the hip, cover that the limb be extended lightly, as is said in the preceding narration concerning the thigh; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand upon the painful limb, and immediately grasps that with the other hand, and with that grasp suspends that extended to the lower parts towards the heel
And if the dislocation is at the back, it is not necessary that the limb be extended to the lower parts, but it is elevated upon the earth; having covered that it should be held with force, just as if the hip joint were dislocated at the hip, as we have said concerning the engagement of the limb for two fingers; and it is over its face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, without haste.
And cover that a compress be administered with a board upon the place where the joint is located.<end_turn>
Therefore when the reduction is completed as we have said — and the signal of the reduction of the limb is not hidden from you, that you extend both limbs of the patient, and when you have once performed those compressions and the patient pulls the thigh limb and expands that relaxation, you will know that the limb is returned as we have said — and then you adjust two cushions and hold together and pull with a bandage so that the thigh is not bruised in any part; and keep the patient quiet for three days or for four.
Then remove the ligament and the dressing, and compare one leg with the other.
When, however, you see that the swelling has subsided in the limb, it is understood that the dislocation has already stopped, and now you can allow the patient to walk again.</end_of_turn>
And if there is any suspicion of an embolism, then return immediately and place that [finger or instrument] there, and withdraw that according to your first assessment, and leave that for three days.</end_of_turn>
Then remove that [finger or instrument], and make the patient walk slowly for several days until comfort is achieved.</end_of_turn>
(End of text)</start_of_turn>
Note: The provided text appears to be the end of the medical treatise, with the concluding sentence reading "De curacio de dislocacio del denolh" (Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the ankle).
The ankle is dislocated in three ways: when the ligaments are torn outwards, when they are torn inwards, and when the ligaments are torn both above and below; but not when they are torn only downwards.</end_of_turn
The sign of dislocation is when the patient applies pressure to the limb with his hand; when this happens, it is understood that the ankle is dislocated.</end_of_turn
As for the restoration of all these positions, make the patient lie down and raise his limb as high as he can; then bind the limb firmly two fingers away from the toes; place the patient’s foot between the thighs; and hold the ankle firmly against the toes over the ankle joint, and keep those fingers tightly bound for a while until the ankle returns to its place.</end_of_turn
The sign of recovery is when the limb hangs limply without pain when the limb is lifted.</end_of_turn
Then place that [finger or instrument] back and make the limb adhere to the limb, and bind those two together with a bandage for three days or four, and then remove those.</start_of_turn
Do not allow the patient to walk for several days until he is healed and comfortable.</end_of_turn
Even if the dislocation has been reduced, it is necessary to strengthen the ligaments that were damaged during the treatment of the swelling beforehand.</end_of_turn
End of treatise.</start_of_turn>
Note: This concludes the medical treatise, with the final sentence reading "De la curacio de la dislocacio del talo" (Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the ankle).</start_of_turn
The ankle joint is sometimes sprained due to a slight displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated completely, and the dislocation can be either upwards or downwards.</start_of_turn
The sign of dislocation is that sometimes the ankle swells as a result of the displacement.</start_of_turn
The treatment for displacement is to promote a gradual recovery, and to keep the limb slightly bent with the greatest ease and to reduce the swelling until it disappears.</start_of_turn
When the dislocation is complete, make the patient lie down, and support that side of the ankle with a strong and valiant hand from behind the two toes of the limb.</start_of_turn
And hold the limb firmly with your right hand on the upper part of the foot, and with your left hand on the lower part of the foot, at the ankle joint.</start_of_turn
Then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then towards the left for two spans, and then extend it again; and bind the toes of the foot to the right side of the bandage.</start_of_turn
And do this for two spans as we have counted.</start_of_turn
And bind the toes of the foot to the bandage for the third span, and you are at the ankle.</start_of_turn
Therefore, if it returns in one span or two according to this manner, and if sometimes the foot swells, it is good; otherwise, if it does not return, repeat the operation until it returns.</start_of_turn
Even if the reduction of the ankle is forbidden in this case, make the patient sit on the edge of the bed, and let him rest on the ground, and place a cushion under the patient’s thighs, and keep him there until the patient has regained consciousness.
The attendants should hold the patient’s limbs firmly and extend the foot with the greatest ease or with the help of the ligament that lies over the ankle bone; and extend the other limb as much as possible, but keep the cushion between the patient’s thighs in order not to irritate the limb.</start_of_turn
And the doctor grasps the dislocation at the hip joints, while another attendant holds the sound limb at the lower parts, so that the dislocation returns easily.
And thus, when the dislocation has returned and you have declared the soundness of the reduction, then pause the plaster and remove that which has been bound tightly, and join the limb to the limb at the bandage.</end_of_turn>
And take care that you fear or guard the nerves that are behind the heel, so that the ligament over that is not taut and that the limb is not tightly bound.</end_of_turn>
Then keep it bandaged for two days or three; and if the ligament is softened, remove that.</end_of_turn
And on the fourth day or the fifth, remove that, and prohibit the patient from eating for forty days.</end_of_turn> May it be necessary to go forward again that space, it is not harmful for safety that the dislocation is not dissolved and corrupted, and that you do not give it any cure.</end_of_turn>
And if indeed it happens that the dislocation has progressed to the heel, then cover that you administer in the cessation of the pain that precedes our narration, in another place of cure and bandaging, until it is healed.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXXIV.</end_of_turn>
On the treatment of dislocation of the bones of the foot.</end_of_turn>
Take that which is dislocated and grasp it with little extension, because that which is not difficult, prevents infection.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is in the ankle bones of the two feet, then cover that you keep the patient sitting on the bed or on a table, and that he stays like this as if he were going.</end_of_turn
Then put your foot on the ground, and stop the heel of the foot from resting on what you imagine of the joints, and hold that which is over the heel until it returns, and that you see that it is already healed and does not reappear in the imminent location.</end_of_turn
Then place under the foot of the patient a board that will encompass the whole foot, which has two caps, and hold that which is over the structure downwards and firmly for three days; and then remove that and make the patient walk again after so many days, until it is healed and the recovery is ensured.</end_of_turn
Chapter XXXV.</end_of_turn
Of the kinds of dislocation that are caused by inflammation or fracture or by some other injury.</end_of_turn
When any cause of these has occurred, and you are taking care of the treatment of that and the restoration of it, the following things must succeed in order to avoid death.</end_of_turn
And for that we do not presume that on the treatment of that we should rely only on the art, of long experience, of mercy and humility, tardiness, not arrogance or presumption; and that he use at the beginning of medicines that do not cause additional damage, and that he refer the patient to the divine judgment, rather than to that to which you hope for salvation from loss, from relief of the disease, and in which any hope appears. And therefore strive as much as possible to bring about the reduction at the beginning of the cause, before the damage has progressed.</end_of_turn
And if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen that will cause gentle swelling and care for the inflammation in that which you consider necessary for the healing of the wound desiccation.</end_of_turn
And if the dislocation is caused by a fractured bone of the heel separated from the rest, then you break the ligament of those and do what we have said in the simple diseases of what precedes these.</end_of_turn
And keep and abstain according to your virtue that which pertains to fear according as you are preceded by my prediction; for what is better for you than to have recourse to the Creator? More lasting is your glory, and more worthy of praise is the true God in the true time.</end_of_turn Thus ends the book of Albucasim perfectly praising God who is good in all things.</end_of_turn> Amen.</end_of_turn>
