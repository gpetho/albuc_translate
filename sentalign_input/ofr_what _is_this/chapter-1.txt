Before we recall the work, it is necessary that I describe the quality of the help and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest discourse and subtle science and hidden secret; and many wise men have spoken of this, and agreed on it; and their words suffice little for me, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery helps universally every complexion where there is matter, except for two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion together with matter, some disagreed and said that cautery is a great help there; and others said the opposite: that cautery is not good for an illness that comes from heat and dryness.
For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot illness should not be treated by heat, nor by dryness; and he who said the opposite said that cautery is a great help for a hot and dry illness that comes into the body of men. 
For when you compare the body of a man and his moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. 
For I have sometimes found it by experiment.
And in any case, no one should interfere except those who have experience and who know, by long use, the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of human complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the length of time; we have no fear of other complexions, especially with cold and moist illnesses.
And all the physicians assembled and agreed on the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater benefit than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not go beyond the limb that is burned, and does not harm other limbs except a little.
Burning medicines spread from one limb to another, and cause illnesses in the limb that are difficult to heal; and perhaps kill the patient. Fire, because of its loftiness and the goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and the length of service and study that I have put into the art, and it was based on the truth of things; and therefore I excuse myself for the length of the speech, for I do not want to deprive you of the secret that lies in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels illnesses from the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating it; now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on what time cauterizations should be done, and they chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable in all seasons, because the sudden harm is lessened by the help of the cautery; and especially if the cautery is for necessary, sudden and urgent pains that cannot wait for the time when a greater malady might come to the limb.
And do not ever think, dear son, as the foolish physicians do; for the illness that is healed by cautery does not return; and they say so; but it is not as they think, because cautery is nothing but a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and is worth more than medicine because of the speed of its effect, and because of the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the illness sometimes comes according to the complexion of the patient and the location of the illness and its nature; and superfluities are gathered in him by the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cautery is administered in a place where there are few superfluities and moisture, such as cautery of teeth for pain, and similar things, and such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cautery is called the last of medicines, and it is true; but they do not believe that cautery is useful after medicine, but their understanding is false, and cautery is the last of medicines because when we administer kinds of treatments for some illness and they are not effective, then we administer cautery, and it works.
Then it is clear that cautery is the last of medicines, not according to the understanding of the foolish physicians.
The ancients said that cautery with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and because of the excellence of its substance; and they said that the site of the cautery does not suppurate, but this is not true for I have tested it, and have found that it is true in some men; and gold cautery is better than iron, as they said.
And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools down quickly; and if it is heated too much, it melts in the fire; and thus there is considerable impediment.
And for this reason we use iron cautery because we have it better prepared for our work.
Now I have arranged this chapter from head to toe, so that the way is easier to find.
