Chapter ninety-two on the incision on the worms generated under the smallpox called the disease of cattle
This disease is called in some of our countries the disease of cattle because it often happens to cattle.
It is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and creeps in the whole body, ascending and descending, becoming apparent to the sense when it creeps from one organ to another until it pierces a place in the skin and comes out.
And its formation is from the putrefaction of some of the humors, as happens to worms, snakes, and حب القرع (probably a type of skin eruption or growth) in the belly.
And what is expected of its harm is that if it creeps in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and come out, thus destroying the eye, and this happens often.
So, if you want to treat it and remove it, it can only be done when it creeps and appears to the sense, so you should tie what is above it and below it with a good tight bandage, then cut over it and remove it.
If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply cauterization with fire to the place until you burn it.
And the greatest thing that is expected is its corruption of the eye, as we have said, so if you see that it has gone to the head near the eye, then tie tightly under it on the forehead, then cut over it and take it out.
And it is necessary that the sick person take care to purify his body with medicines that purge the putrid, bad humors and be cautious of foods that generate putrefaction.
