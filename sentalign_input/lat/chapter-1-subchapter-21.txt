On the method of cauterizing for tooth pain.
Chapter 23.
When tooth pain is due to coldness or worms in the tooth, and medicinal treatments are ineffective, there are two methods of cauterization: cauterization with butter or with fire.
For cauterization with butter, take cow’s butter and boil it in an iron spoon or small vessel.
Then take a piece of cloth and wrap it around the tip of a probe.
Next, dip it into the boiling butter and quickly place it on the painful tooth, holding it there until it cools. Repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Alternatively, if you prefer, soak wool or cloth in cold butter, place it over the painful tooth, and then place heated iron over it until the heat reaches the depth of the tooth’s cavity.
For cauterization with fire, use a copper or iron tube.
The body of the tube should be thick enough to prevent the intense heat from reaching the patient’s mouth.
Then heat the cautery in the specified form, place it over the tooth, and hold your hand steady until the cautery cools.
Repeat this several times; the pain will dissipate either that day or the next.
After applying the cautery, have the patient fill his mouth with good butter, hold it there for an hour, and then spit it out.
This is the form of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever end of the instrument you find most suitable, and this is the form of the tube.
